Current literature suggests that people with psychiatric disorders have a higher 
risk of COVID-19 infection and a worse prognosis of the disease. We aimed to 
study the genetic contribution to these associations across seven psychiatric 
disorders as well as a general psychopathology factor (P-factor) and determine 
whether these are unique or shared across psychiatric disorders using 
statistical genetic techniques. Using the largest available genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS), we found a significant genetic overlap between 
depression, ADHD, PTSD, and the P-factor with both COVID-19 infection and 
hospitalization, and between anxiety and COVID-19 hospitalization. We used 
pairwise GWAS to examine this overlap on a fine-grained scale and identified 
specific regions of the genome shared between several psychiatric disorders, the 
P-factor, and COVID-19. Gene-based analysis in these genomic regions suggested 
possible links with immune-related pathways such as thyroid homeostasis, 
inflammation, and stress response. Finally, we show preliminary evidence for 
causal associations between depression, ADHD, PTSD, and the P-factor, and higher 
COVID-19 infection and hospitalization using Mendelian Randomization and Latent 
Causal Variable methods. Our results support the hypothesis that the 
relationship between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 risk is likely due to 
shared alterations in immune-related pathways and is not a result of 
environmental factors alone, shedding light on potentially viable therapeutic 
targets.

BACKGROUD: Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) have been associated with various 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in observational data. However, the causality of 
these associations remains uncertain. Therefore, a systematic assessment of the 
impact of AIDS on cardiovascular risk is required.
RESULTS: We assessed the impact of 19 common AIDs on 14 CVDs using bidirectional 
Mendelian randomization (MR). Celiac disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.949, 95 % 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.111-7.827, P = 0.030) and type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM) (OR = 1.044, 95 % CI: 1.021-1.068, P = 1.82e-4) were associated with an 
increased risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Additionally, celiac 
disease was linked to an increased risk of arrhythmia (OR = 1.008, 95 % CI: 
1.002-1.013, P = 0.004), multiple sclerosis to venous thromboembolism 
(OR = 1.001, 95 % CI: 1.000-1.001, P = 0.010), and psoriasis to heart failure 
(OR = 1.048, 95 % CI: 1.021-1.077, P = 0.001). Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to enhance the robustness of these findings. Predominantly, immune 
response and inflammation-related pathways were enriched in the aforementioned 
associations. Mediation analysis identified human leukocyte antigen-DR positive 
myeloid dendritic cells as partially mediating the effect of T1DM on PAD, with a 
mediated proportion of 16.61 % (P = 0.028). Potential therapeutic agents, such 
as tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and interferon, may have efficacy in 
treating AID-related CVDs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents genetic evidence of certain AIDs impacting 
specific CVDs and identifies potential mediators and drugs.

Early detection is warranted to improve prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) but 
remains challenging. Liquid biopsy combined with machine learning will provide 
new insights into diagnostic strategies of GC. Lipid metabolism reprogramming 
plays a crucial role in the initiation and development of tumors. Here, we 
integrated the lipidomics data of three cohorts (n = 944) to develop the lipid 
metabolic landscape of GC. We further constructed the serum lipid metabolic 
signature (SLMS) by machine learning, which showed great performance in 
distinguishing GC patients from healthy donors. Notably, the SLMS also held high 
efficacy in the diagnosis of early-stage GC. Besides, by performing unsupervised 
consensus clustering analysis on the lipid metabolic matrix of patients with GC, 
we generated the gastric cancer prognostic subtypes (GCPSs) with significantly 
different overall survival. Furthermore, the lipid metabolic disturbance in GC 
tissues was demonstrated by multi-omics analysis, which showed partially 
consistent with that in GC serums. Collectively, this study revealed an 
innovative strategy of liquid biopsy for the diagnosis of GC on the basis of the 
serum lipid metabolic fingerprints.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the potential biomarkers associated with 
pyroptosis in diabetic kidney disease (DKD).
METHODS: Three datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were downloaded 
and merged into an integrated dataset. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were filtered and intersected with pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs). 
Pyroptosis-related DEGs (PRDEGs) were obtained and analyzed using functional 
enrichment analysis. Random forest, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection 
Operator, and logistic regression analyses were used to select the features of 
PRDEGs. These feature genes were used to build a diagnostic prediction model, 
identify the subtypes of the disease, and analyze their interactions with 
transcription factors (TFs)/miRNAs/drugs and small molecules. We conducted a 
comparative analysis of immune cell infiltration at different risk levels of 
pyroptosis. qRT-PCR was used to validate the expression of the feature genes.
RESULTS: A total of 25 PRDEGs were obtained. These genes were coenriched in 
biological processes and pathways, such as the regulation of inflammatory 
responses. Five key genes (CASP1, CITED2, HTRA1, PTGS2, S100A12) were identified 
and verified using qRT-PCR. The diagnostic model based on key genes has a good 
diagnostic prediction ability. Five key genes interacted with TFs and miRNAs in 
67 and 80 pairs, respectively, and interacted with 113 types of drugs or 
molecules. Immune infiltration of samples with different pyroptosis risk levels 
showed significant differences. Thus, CASP1, CITED2, HTRA1, PTGS2 and S100A12 
are potential DKD biomarkers.
CONCLUSION: Genes that regulate pyroptosis can be used as predictors of DKD. 
Early diagnosis of DKD can aid in its effective treatment.

Regulated cell death is a pivotal regulatory mechanism governing the development 
and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. A comprehensive understanding of 
RCD's regulatory mechanisms is crucial for developing novel therapeutic 
strategies against diseases associated with cell death, such as cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing data repositories support limited 
types of cell death data and lack comprehensive annotation and analytical 
functionalities. Thus, establishing an extensive cell death database is an 
urgent imperative. To address this gap, we developed the Regulated Cell Death 
Database (RCDdb, chenyclab.com/RCDdb), the first comprehensively manually 
annotated database designed to support annotations and analytical capabilities 
across all RCD types. We compiled 3090 marker gene annotations associated with 
15 RCD types from 2180 relevant articles. The RCDdb includes annotation data on 
these marker genes concerning diseases, drugs, pathways, proteins, and gene 
expressions. Furthermore, it provides 49 diverse visualization methods to 
present this information. More importantly, the RCDdb features three online 
analysis tools for identifying and analyzing RCD-related features within 
user-submitted data. Furthermore, the RCDdb offers a user-friendly interface for 
querying, browsing, analysis, and visualization of detailed information 
associated with each RCD category. This resource promises to significantly aid 
researchers in better understanding the mechanisms of cell death, thereby 
accelerating progress in research and therapeutic strategies aimed at combating 
RCD-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a gynae-endocrine disorder, has 
a relatively high risk of differential expression of miRNA (DE-miRNA) in the 
disease progression.
AIMS: To identify the DE-miRNA in the progression of PCOS in the ovarian cumulus 
cells.
METHODS: The microarray dataset GSE72274 was analysed for PCOS-associated 
DE-miRNAs. miRNet identifies the target genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network was constructed and hub genes were analysed by topology and module 
analysis. Transcription factors (TFs) and protein kinases (PKs) regulating the 
hub genes were identified using X2K tool. Biological functions were analysed 
using DAVID software. Finally, the DGIdb drug-gene interaction tool identifies 
the candidate medications.
RESULTS: A total of 1577 DE-miRNAs linked to PCOS were identified, with 13 
meeting the specified criteria. Subsequently, its 2053 target genes were 
retrieved through miRNet. Topology and module analysis identified the hub genes 
VEGFA, SOX2, KRAS, AKT1, and SMAD4 that are implicated in ovarian regulation. 
Notably, the study highlighted the significant role of the wnt signalling 
pathway, which is involved in ovarian function, specifically in follicle 
development, corpus luteum formation, and steroid production. Additionally, six 
TFs and PKs were identified as important regulators of these hub genes, and the 
potential medication interactions identified 11 medicines for VEGFA, KRAS, AKT1, 
and SMAD4 genes, while no suitable drug for SOX2 was identified.
CONCLUSION: Identified, hub genes are known to associate with the regulation of 
ovarian function such as oocyte development, and steroid synthesis via the wnt 
signalling pathway.

Analysis and identification of ferroptosis-related diagnostic markers in 
rheumatoid arthritis.

Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, inflammatory joint 
disease. There is growing evidence that ferroptosis is involved in the 
pathogenesis of RA. This study aimed to search for diagnostic markers of 
ferroptosis in RA and to analyse the potential mechanisms and clinical value.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RA-associated datasets were used from the publicly 
available GEO database. Three methods of machine learning were applied to screen 
biomarkers. The diagnostic efficacy of the results was also verified by receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve, external dataset, qRT-PCR and Western 
blot. Enrichment analysis was performed in this process, while protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) analysis and immune infiltration correlation analysis were 
performed using biomarkers, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were 
constructed to search for prospective therapeutic targets.
RESULTS: MMP13 and GABARAPL1 can be used as ferroptosis diagnostic genes in RA. 
The ROC curve and PPI result demonstrated that MMP13 and GABARAPL1 had an 
excellent diagnostic value. The results of signature genes in the external 
dataset, qRT-PCR and Western blot further confirm our findings. The enrichment 
analysis showed that p53, MAPK and NOD-like receptor signalling pathways may be 
involved in the process of ferroptosis in RA. In addition, two ferroptosis 
diagnostic genes in RA participate in the occurrence of ferroptosis in RA via 
oxidative stress, metabolism and immune response. Immune infiltration analysis 
showed that RA extensively infiltrated B cells, T cells, macrophages and other 
immune cells. Persistent immune activation may be an essential reason for the 
progression of ferroptosis in RA. We also obtained five potential therapeutic 
agents for RA and some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) 
regulating ferroptosis diagnostic genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that MMP13 and GABARAPL1, which are closely 
linked with oxidative stress and immunological modulation, can be used as 
ferroptosis-related potential diagnostic markers in RA and provide new clues 
regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic targets of ferroptosis in RA.

Opioid overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States 
and remains a major public health concern, despite significant resources aimed 
at combating opioid misuse. Neurobiological research to elucidate molecular and 
cellular consequences of opioid exposure is required to define avenues to 
explore for reversal of opioid-induced neuroadaptations. Opioids impart 
well-documented regulation of the transcriptome and epigenetic modifications in 
the brain, but opioid-induced epitranscriptomic posttranscriptional regulation 
of RNA is vastly understudied. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is 
significantly enriched in the brain and involved in learning, memory, and 
reward. m6A modifications have not been studied in opioid use disorder, despite 
being the most common RNA modification. We detected significant regulation of 
m6A-modifying enzymes in rat primary cortical cultures following morphine 
treatment, including AlkB Homolog 5 (Alkbh5). The m6a demethylase ALKBH5 
functions as an m6A eraser, removing m6A modifications from mRNA. We 
hypothesized that chronic opioid treatment regulates m6A modifications through 
modulation of Alkbh5 and profiled m6A modifications in primary cortical cultures 
following chronic morphine treatment and Alkbh5 knock-down. We observed 
differential regulation of m6A modifications for a common set of transcripts 
following morphine or Alkbh5 knock-down, and the two treatments elicited 
concordant m6A epitranscriptomic profiles, suggesting that a subset of 
morphine-driven m6A modifications may be mediated through downregulation of 
Alkbh5 in cortical cultures. Gene Ontology terms of commonly regulated 
transcripts included serotonin secretion, synapse disassembly, neuron 
remodeling, and immune response. Thus, we conclude that morphine can drive 
epitranscriptomic changes, a subset of which may occur in an Alkbh5-dependent 
manner.

Identifying potential cancer-associated genes and drug targets from omics data 
is challenging due to its diverse sources and analyses, requiring advanced 
skills and large amounts of time. To facilitate such analysis, we developed 
Cat-E (Cancer Target Explorer), a novel R/Shiny web tool designed for 
comprehensive analysis with evaluation according to cancer-related omics data. 
Cat-E is accessible at https://cat-e.bioinfo-wuerz.eu/. Cat-E compiles 
information on oncolytic viruses, cell lines, gene markers, and clinical studies 
by integrating molecular datasets from key databases such as OvirusTB, TCGA, 
DrugBANK, and PubChem. Users can use all datasets and upload their data to 
perform multiple analyses, such as differential gene expression analysis, 
metabolic pathway exploration, metabolic flux analysis, GO and KEGG enrichment 
analysis, survival analysis, immune signature analysis, single nucleotide 
variation analysis, dynamic analysis of gene expression changes and gene 
regulatory network changes, and protein structure prediction. Cancer target 
evaluation by Cat-E is demonstrated here on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) datasets. 
By offering a user-friendly interface and detailed user manual, Cat-E eliminates 
the need for advanced computational expertise, making it accessible to 
experimental biologists, undergraduate and graduate students, and oncology 
clinicians. It serves as a valuable tool for investigating genetic variations 
across diverse cancer types, facilitating the identification of novel diagnostic 
markers and potential therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify the potential diagnostic markers and associated 
molecular mechanisms based on programmed cell death (PCD)-related genes in 
patients with heart failure (HF).
METHODS: Three HF gene expression data were extracted from the GEO database, 
including GSE57345 (training data), GSE141910 and GSE76701 (validation data), 
followed by differentially PCD related genes (DPCDs) was shown between HF and 
control samples. Enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
analyses were performed based on the DPCDs. Subsequently, a diagnostic model was 
constructed and validated after exploring the diagnostic markers using machine 
learning. A nomogram was used to determine the clinical diagnostic value. 
Diagnostic marker-based immune, transcription network, and gene set enrichment 
(GSE) analyses were performed. Finally, the drug-target network was 
investigated.
RESULTS: Twenty DPCDs were revealed between the two groups. These genes, such as 
Serpin Family E Member 1 (SERPINE1), are mainly enriched in pathways such as the 
regulation of the inflammatory response. A PPI network was constructed using 14 
DPCDs. Eight diagnostic markers, such as SERPINE1, CD38 molecule (CD38), and 
S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), were explored using machine learning 
algorithms, followed by diagnostic model construction. A nomogram and 
immune-associated analysis was used to validate the diagnostic value of these 
genes and the model. Moreover, the transcription regulation network and 
drug-target interactions were further investigated. Finally, qRT-PCR confirmed 
that the expression levels of eight signature genes (CD14, CD38, CTSK, LAPTM5, 
S100A9, SERPINE1, SLC11A1, and STAT3) were significantly elevated in the 
observation group, consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study constructed a valuable diagnostic model for HF using the 
eight identified DPCDs as diagnostic markers.

Endocrine fibroblast growth factors (eFGFs) play essential roles in cellular 
signaling processes, including development and differentiation, and are 
implicated in various cancers. However, their precise involvement in colon 
neoplasia and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) remains incompletely understood. Here, 
we conducted a comprehensive investigation utilizing multiple databases to 
explore the multifaceted characteristics of eFGFs. Through integrated analyses 
of diverse databases, including TIMER2.0, UALCAN, OncoDB, cBioPortal, 
LinkedOmics, STRING, htfTarget, mirTarBase, circBank, and DGIdb, we explored 
eFGFs' gene expression, DNA methylation, prognostic significance, genetic 
alterations, gene regulatory networks, functional analysis, and drug 
interactions in COAD patients. Our findings revealed elevated expression levels 
of eFGFs in COAD, with aberrant gene expression potentially linked to promoter 
methylation. Importantly, hypermethylation of FGF21 and FGF23 and downregulation 
of FGF23 correlated with poor survival outcomes in COAD patients. Functional 
analyses highlighted the involvement of eFGF genes in Ras signaling, PI3K-Akt 
signaling, and cancer pathways. Furthermore, we validated our findings through a 
cross-sectional study by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR), confirming significant overexpression of FGF21 in colon polyps 
compared to normal mucosa. Additionally, we observed elevated RNA expression of 
FGF21 and FGF23 in adenomatous polyps compared to hyperplastic polyps. This 
study sheds new light on the critical roles of eFGFs in COAD tumorigenesis and 
underscores their potential as promising prognostic markers for COAD, as well as 
discriminative markers for distinguishing high-risk from low-risk polyps. These 
findings provide valuable insights into the complex molecular mechanisms 
underlying colorectal neoplasia and offer potential avenues for targeted 
therapeutic strategies.

The effectiveness of drug treatments is profoundly influenced by individual 
responses, which are shaped by gene expression variability, particularly within 
pharmacogenes. Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, our study 
explores the extent of expression variability among pharmacogenes in a wide 
array of cell types across eight different human tissues, shedding light on 
their impact on drug responses. Our findings broaden the established link 
between variability in pharmacogene expression and drug efficacy to encompass 
variability at the cellular level. Moreover, we unveil a promising approach to 
enhance drug efficacy prediction. This is achieved by leveraging a combination 
of cross-cell and cross-individual pharmacogene expression variation 
measurements. Our study opens avenues for more precise forecasting of drug 
performance, facilitating tailored and more effective treatments in the future.

The heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been recognized in clinical, 
with patients categorized into distinct subsets based on motor phenotype, such 
as tremor-dominant PD (TD), postural instability and gait difficulty-dominant PD 
(PIGD) and mixed PD (Mix). Despite this categorization, the underlying 
mechanisms of this heterogeneity remain poorly understood, and there is no 
personalized effective treatment for each PD subtype. To address this, a rat 
model for PD subtypes was established by unilateral stereotaxic injection of 
6-OHDA, followed by cluster analysis of behavioral data. The serum neurofilament 
light chain (NfL) and uric acid (UA) levels as well as alterations in brain 
autonomic activity in rats were consistent with clinical patients, and 
metabolomics results showed that more than 70% of the metabolites in the serum 
of different subtypes of PD rats and clinical patients appeared to be 
consistently altered. Further transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq has elucidated 
that the development of PD subtypes is associated with altered gene expression 
in neurotransmitter, neuronal damage in the central or peripheral nervous 
system, and lipid metabolism. In addition, based on the subtype-specific 
differentially expressed genes, 25 potential drug candidates were identified. 
Notably, the Alox15 inhibitor baicalein showed a greater efficacy on Mix rats, 
highlighting the possibility of selecting targeted treatments for well-defined 
individuals.

Primary open-angle glaucoma typically presents as two subtypes. This study aimed 
to elucidate the shared and distinct genetic architectures of normal-tension 
(NTG) and high-tension glaucoma (HTG), motivated by the need to develop 
intraocular pressure (IOP)-independent drug targets for the disease. We 
conducted a comprehensive multi-ethnic meta-analysis, prioritized variants based 
on functional annotation, and explored drug-gene interactions. We further 
assessed the genetic overlap between NTG and HTG using pairwise GWAS analysis. 
We identified 22 risk loci associated with NTG, 17 of which have not previously 
been reported for NTG. Two loci, BMP4 and TBKBP1, have not previously been 
associated with glaucoma at the genome-wide significance level. Our results 
indicate that while there is a significant overlap in risk loci between tension 
subtypes, the magnitude of the effect tends to be lower in NTG compared to HTG, 
particularly for IOP-related loci. Additionally, we identified a potential role 
for biologic immunomodulatory treatments as neuroprotective agents.

In recent years, the expansion of molecularly targeted cancer therapies has 
significantly advanced precision oncology. Parallel developments in 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have also improved precision 
oncology applications, making genomic analysis of tumors more affordable and 
accessible. Targeted NGS panels now enable the rapid identification of diverse 
actionable mutations, requiring clinicians to efficiently assess the predictive 
value of cancer biomarkers for specific treatments. The urgency for timely and 
accurate decision-making in oncology emphasizes the importance of reliable 
precision oncology software. Online clinical decision-making tools and 
associated cancer databases have been designed by consolidating genomic data 
into standardized, accessible formats. These new platforms are highly integrated 
and crucial for identifying actionable somatic genomic biomarkers essential for 
tumor survival, determining corresponding drug targets, and selecting 
appropriate treatments based on the mutational profile of each patient's tumor. 
To help oncologists and translational cancer researchers unfamiliar with these 
tools, we review the utility, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of several 
commonly used precision medicine software options currently available. Our 
analysis categorized selected genomic databases based on their primary content, 
utility, and how well they provide practical guidance for interpreting somatic 
biomarker data. We identified several comprehensive, mostly open-access 
platforms that are easy to use for genetic biomarker searches, each with unique 
features and limitations. Among the precision oncology tools we evaluated, we 
found MyCancerGenome and OncoKB to be the first choice, offering comprehensive, 
accurate up-to-date information on the clinical significance of somatic 
mutations. To illustrate the application of these precision oncology tools in 
clinical settings, we evaluated three case studies to see how use of the 
platforms could have influenced treatment planning. Most of the precision 
oncology software evaluated could be easily streamlined into clinical workflows 
to provide updated information on approved drugs and clinical trials related the 
actionable mutations detected. Some platforms were very intuitive and easy to 
use, while others, often developed in smaller academic settings, were more 
difficult to navigate and may not be updated consistently. Future enhancements, 
incorporating artificial intelligence algorithms, are likely to improve 
integration of the platforms with diverse big data sources, enabling more 
accurate predictions of potential therapeutic responses.

Integrating proteomic and transcriptomic data with genetic architectures of 
problematic alcohol use and alcohol consumption behaviours can advance our 
understanding and help identify therapeutic targets. We conducted systematic 
screens using genome-wise association study data from ~3,500 cortical proteins 
(N = 722) and ~6,100 genes in 8 canonical brain cell types (N = 192) with 4 
alcohol-related outcomes (N ≤ 537,349), identifying 217 cortical proteins and 
255 cell-type genes associated with these behaviours, with 36 proteins and 37 
cell-type genes being new. Although there was limited overlap between proteome 
and transcriptome targets, downstream neuroimaging revealed shared 
neurophysiological pathways. Colocalization with independent genome-wise 
association study data further prioritized 16 proteins, including CAB39L and 
NRBP1, and 12 cell-type genes, implicating mechanisms such as mTOR signalling. 
In addition, genes such as SAMHD1, VIPAS39, NUP160 and INO80E were identified as 
having favourable neuropsychiatric profiles. These findings provide insights 
into the genetic landscapes governing problematic alcohol use and alcohol 
consumption behaviours, highlighting promising therapeutic targets for future 
research.

Osteoarthritic (OA) pain affects 18% of females and 9.6% of males aged over 60 
worldwide, with 62% of all OA patients being women. The molecular drivers of 
sex-based differences in OA are unknown. Bone is intricately coupled with the 
sensory nervous system and one of the only joint tissues known to show changes 
that correlate with patient pain in OA. There are fundamental sex differences in 
pain sensation and bone biology which may be intrinsic to OA disease 
progression, however these differences are vastly under researched. We have 
utilised three data sets to investigate the hypothesis that potential mediators 
responsible for sex dependent pain mechanisms displayed in OA are derived from 
mechanically stimulated osteocytes. Our published dataset of the in vitro human 
osteocyte mechanosome was independently compared with published data from, 
sex-based gene expression differences in human long bone, the sex-based gene 
expression differences during the skeletal maturation of the mouse osteocyte 
transcriptome and sex specific OA risk factors and effector genes in a large 
human GWAS. 80 of the 377 sex-specific genes identified in the mouse osteocyte 
transcriptome were mechanically regulated in osteocytes with enrichment 
associated with neural crest migration and axon extension, and DISEASES analysis 
enrichment for the rheumatoid arthritis pathway. 3861 mechanically regulated 
osteocytic genes displayed sex-specific differences in human long bone with 
enrichment for genes associated with the synapse, sensory perception of pain, 
axon guidance, immune responses, distal peripheral sensory neuropathy, sensory 
neuropathy, and poor wound healing. 32 of 77 effector genes and 1 of 3 female 
specific OA risk factor genes identified in the human GWAS were differentially 
expressed in the osteocyte mechanosome and male and female bone. This analysis 
lends support to the hypothesis that mechanically regulated genes in osteocytes 
could influence sex specific differences in osteoarthritic pain and highlights 
pain pathways with approved drugs that could potentially treat elevated pain 
susceptibility in females with OA.

PURPOSE: Retinal neovascularization poses heightened risks of vision loss and 
blindness. Despite its clinical significance, the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the pathogenesis of retinal neovascularization remain elusive. This 
study utilized single-cell multiomics profiling in an oxygen-induced retinopathy 
(OIR) model to comprehensively investigate the intricate molecular landscape of 
retinal neovascularization.
METHODS: Mice were exposed to hyperoxia to induce the OIR model, and retinas 
were isolated for nucleus isolation. The cellular landscape of the 
single-nucleus suspensions was extensively characterized through single-cell 
multiomics sequencing. Single-cell data were integrated with genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) data to identify correlations between ocular cell types 
and diabetic retinopathy. Cell communication analysis among cells was conducted 
to unravel crucial ligand-receptor signals. Trajectory analysis and dynamic 
characterization of Müller cells were performed, followed by integration with 
human retinal data for pathway analysis.
RESULTS: The multiomics dataset revealed six major ocular cell classes, with 
Müller cells/astrocytes showing significant associations with proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Cell communication analysis highlighted pathways 
that are associated with vascular proliferation and neurodevelopment, such as 
Vegfa-Vegfr2, Igf1-Igf1r, Nrxn3-Nlgn1, and Efna5-Epha4. Trajectory analysis 
identified a subset of Müller cells expressing genes linked to photoreceptor 
degeneration. Multiomics data integration further unveiled positively regulated 
genes in OIR Müller cells/astrocytes associated with axon development and 
neurotransmitter transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: This study significantly advances our understanding of the 
intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying retinal 
neovascularization, emphasizing the pivotal role of Müller cells. The identified 
pathways provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for PDR, 
offering promising directions for further research and clinical interventions.

Social isolation is an established risk factor for psychiatric illness, and 
became increasingly topical with the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We used RNA 
sequencing (RNA-Seq) to enable unbiased assessment of transcriptomic changes 
within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of isolation-reared rats. To provide insight 
into the relevance of this manipulation for studying human illness, we compared 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched biological functions against 
datasets involving post-mortem frontal cortical tissue from patients with 
psychiatric and neurodevelopmental illnesses. Sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats 
were reared in groups of four or individually from weaning on postnatal day 
(PND) 22-24 until PFC tissue collection for RNA-Seq (PND64-66). We identified a 
total of 183 DEGs in isolates, of which 128 mirrored those in PFC tissue from 
patients with stress-related mental illnesses and/or neurodevelopmental 
conditions featuring social deficits. Seventy-one encode proteins classed as 
druggable by the gene-drug interaction database. Interestingly there are 
antagonists or inhibitors for the products of three of these up-regulated DEGs 
(Hrh3, Snca and Sod1) and agonists or activators for products of six of these 
down-regulated DEGs (Chrm4, Klf2, Lrrk2, Nr4a1, Nr4a3 and Prkca). Some have 
already undergone pre-clinical and clinical evaluation, and studies with the 
remainder may be warranted. Changes to Hrh3, Sod1, Chrm4, Lrrk2, Nr4a1 and Prkca 
were replicated in an independent cohort of sixteen male Sprague-Dawley rats via 
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our 
findings support the continued use of post-weaning isolation rearing to 
investigate the neurobiology of stress-related disorders and evaluate 
therapeutic targets.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of global mortality and presents a 
significant barrier to improving life expectancy. The primary objective of this 
study was to discern a unique differentially expressed gene (DEG) that exhibits 
a strong association with colorectal cancer. By achieving this goal, the 
research aims to contribute valuable insights to the field of translational 
medicine. We performed analysis of colorectal cancer microarray and the TCGA 
colon adenoma carcinoma (COAD) datasets to identify DEGs associated with COAD 
and common DEGs were selected. Furthermore, a pan-cancer analysis encompassing 
33 different cancer types was performed to identify differential genes 
significantly expressed only in COAD. Then, comprehensively in-silico analysis 
including gene set enrichment analysis, constructing Protein-Protein 
interaction, co-expression, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, 
investigating the correlation between tumor-immune signatures in distinct tumor 
microenvironment and also the potential interactions between the identified gene 
and various drugs was executed. Further, the candidate gene was experimentally 
validated in tumoral colorectal tissues and colorectal adenomatous polyps by 
qRael-Time PCR. GUCA2A emerged as a significant DEG specific to colorectal 
cancer (|log2FC|> 1 and adjusted q-value < 0.05). Importantly, GUCA2A exhibited 
excellent diagnostic performance for COAD, with a 99.6% and 78% area under the 
curve (AUC) based on TCGA-COAD and colon cancer patients. In addition, GUCA2A 
expression in adenomatous polyps equal to or larger than 5 mm was significantly 
lower compared to smaller than 5 mm. Moreover, low expression of GUCA2A 
significantly impacted overall patient survival. Significant correlations were 
observed between tumor-immune signatures and GUCA2A expression. The ceRNA 
constructed included GUCA2A, 8 shared miRNAs, and 61 circRNAs. This study 
identifies GUCA2A as a promising prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for 
colorectal cancer. Further investigations are warranted to explore the potential 
of GUCA2A as a therapeutic biomarker.

Gene-environment interactions (G × E), the interplay of genetic variation with 
environmental factors, have a pivotal impact on human complex traits and 
diseases. Statistically, G × E can be assessed by determining the deviation from 
expectation of predictive models based solely on the phenotypic effects of 
genetics or environmental exposures. Despite the unprecedented, widespread and 
diverse use of G × E analytical frameworks, heterogeneity in their application 
and reporting hinders their applicability in public health. In this Review, we 
discuss study design considerations as well as G × E analytical frameworks to 
assess polygenic liability dependent on the environment, to identify specific 
genetic variants exhibiting G × E, and to characterize environmental context for 
these dynamics. We conclude with recommendations to address the most common 
challenges and pitfalls in the conceptualization, methodology and reporting of 
G × E studies, as well as future directions.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder with complex origins. 
Observational studies suggested that inflammatory factors may play a role in the 
pathophysiology of SZ and we aim to investigate the potential genetic connection 
between them by examining the causal impact of circulating inflammatory proteins 
on SZ.
METHODS: We utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal 
relationship between circulating inflammatory proteins and SZ and the GWAS 
summary datasets were sourced from public databases. The SZ dataset comprised 
74,776 cases and 101,023 controls, while the summary results for 91 plasma 
proteins in 14,824 participants were obtained through the Olink Target platform. 
Moreover, to identify and evaluate potential drug targets, we searched the 
Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb).
RESULTS: The results of the MR study confirmed that nine inflammatory proteins 
had a causal effect on SZ. Among these proteins, IL1A (OR: 0.93), TNFB (OR: 
0.94), TNFSF14 (OR: 0.96), and CD40 (OR: 0.95) exhibited protective effects 
against SZ. Conversely, CCL23 (OR: 1.04), CCL19 (OR: 1.04), 4EBP1 (OR: 1.06), 
TWEAK (OR: 1.08), and DNER (OR: 1.10) were associated with an increased risk of 
SZ. The MR-Egger and weighted median methods also supported the direction of 
these effects. According to the Gene-Drug analysis, LTA, IL1A, CD40, and 4EBP1 
can serve as drug targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study established causal relationships between circulating 
inflammatory proteins and SZ. It may be beneficial to personalize the treatment 
of SZ by incorporating inflammation management into the treatment regimen.

Immunity has shown potentials in informing drug development for cardiometabolic 
diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, 
we performed a transcriptome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to estimate 
the putative causal effects of 11,021 gene expression profiles during CD4+ T 
cells activation on the development of T2D and CAD. Robust MR and colocalization 
evidence was observed for 162 genes altering T2D risk and 80 genes altering CAD 
risk, with 12% and 16% respectively demonstrating CD4+ T cell specificity. We 
observed temporal causal patterns during T cell activation in 69 gene-T2D pairs 
and 34 gene-CAD pairs. These genes were eight times more likely to show robust 
genetic evidence. We further identified 25 genes that were targets for drugs 
under clinical investigation, including LIPA and GCK. This study provides 
evidence to support immune-to-metabolic disease connections, and prioritises 
immune-mediated drug targets for cardiometabolic diseases.

Epigenetic aberration is one of the major driving factors in human cancer, often 
leading to acquired resistance to chemotherapies. Various small molecule 
epigenetic modulators have been reported. Nonetheless, outcomes from animal 
models and clinical trials have underscored the substantial setbacks attributed 
to pronounced on- and off-target toxicities. To address these challenges, 
CRISPR/dCas9 technology is emerging as a potent tool for precise modulation of 
epigenetic mechanism. However, this technology involves co-expressing exogenous 
epigenetic modulator proteins, which presents technical challenges in 
preparation and delivery with potential undesirable side effects. Recently, our 
research demonstrated that Cas9 tagged with the Phe-Cys-Pro-Phe (FCPF)-peptide 
motif can be specifically targeted by perfluorobiphenyl (PFB) derivatives. Here, 
we integrated the FCPF-tag into dCas9 and established a chemically inducible 
platform for epigenome editing, called Chem-CRISPR/dCas9FCPF. We designed a 
series of chemical inhibitor-PFB conjugates targeting various epigenetic 
modulator proteins. Focusing on JQ1, a panBET inhibitor, we demonstrate that 
c-MYC-sgRNA-guided JQ1-PFB specifically inhibits BRD4 in close proximity to the 
c-MYC promoter/enhancer, thereby effectively repressing the intricate 
transcription networks orchestrated by c-MYC as compared with JQ1 alone. In 
conclusion, our Chem-CRISPR/dCas9FCPF platform significantly increased target 
specificity of chemical epigenetic inhibitors, offering a viable alternative to 
conventional fusion protein systems for epigenome editing.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) poses a global health challenge. While 
pyroptosis is implicated in various diseases, its specific involvement in NAFLD 
remains unclear. Thus, our study aims to elucidate the role and mechanisms of 
pyroptosis in NAFLD. Utilizing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database, we analyzed the expression levels of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) 
in NAFLD and normal tissues using the R data package. We investigated protein 
interactions, correlations, and functional enrichment of these genes. Key genes 
were identified employing multiple machine learning techniques. 
Immunoinfiltration analyses were conducted to discern differences in immune cell 
populations between NAFLD patients and controls. Key gene expression was 
validated using a cell model. Analysis of GEO datasets, comprising 206 NAFLD 
samples and 10 controls, revealed two key PRGs (TIRAP, and GSDMD). Combining 
these genes yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 for diagnosing NAFLD. 
In an external dataset, the AUC for the two key genes was 0.825. Nomogram, 
decision curve, and calibration curve analyses further validated their 
diagnostic efficacy. These genes were implicated in multiple pathways associated 
with NAFLD progression. Immunoinfiltration analysis showed significantly lower 
numbers of various immune cell types in NAFLD patient samples compared to 
controls. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was employed to 
assess the immune microenvironment. Finally, the expression of the two key genes 
was validated in cell NAFLD model using qRT-PCR. We developed a prognostic model 
for NAFLD based on two PRGs, demonstrating robust predictive efficacy. Our 
findings enhance the understanding of pyroptosis in NAFLD and suggest potential 
avenues for therapeutic exploration.

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with an increased 
risk of mortality and cardiovascular events. However, none therapeutic drugs 
have been proven effective for CAC treatment. The objective of this study was to 
identify potential therapeutic targets for CAC through the utilization of 
Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analysis.
METHODS: The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of 16,943 genes from the 
eQTLGen consortium and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) of 4,412 proteins 
from a plasma proteome were utilized as genetic instruments. Genetic 
associations with CAC were derived from a GWAS meta-analysis of 26,909 
individuals. The MR and colocalization analysis were utilized to identify 
potential target genes.
RESULTS: A total of 671 genes were found to be significantly associated with the 
risk of CAC based on transcriptomic MR analysis at a false discovery rate <0.05, 
while proteomic MR analysis identified 15 genes with significant associations 
with CAC at the same threshold. With robust evidence from colocalization 
analysis, we observed positive associations between CWF19L2, JARID2, and MANBA 
and the risk of CAC, while KLB exhibited an inverse association. In summary, our 
study identified 23 potential therapeutic targets for CAC. Further downstream 
analysis revealed IGFBP3, ABCC6, ULK3, DOT1L, KLB and AMH as promising 
candidates for repurposing in the treatment of CAC.
CONCLUSION: The integrated MR analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data 
identified multiple potential drug targets for the treatment of CAC. ULK3, 
DOT1L, and AMH were recognized as novel targets for drug repurposing for CAC and 
deserve further investigation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
globally, with limited treatment options. The goal of this study was to use 
integrated bioinformatic analysis to find possible biomarkers for prognosis and 
therapeutic targets for hepatitis B (HBV)-associated HCC. Three microarray 
datasets (GSE84402, GSE121248, and E-GEOD-19665) from patients with 
HBV-associated HCC were combined and analyzed. We identified differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) and performed pathway enrichment analysis. We constructed 
protein-protein interaction networks to identify hub genes. We identified a 
total of 374 DEGs, which included 90 up-regulated and 284 down-regulated genes. 
Pathway enrichment analysis revealed associations with cell cycle, oocyte 
meiosis, and the p53 signaling pathway for up-regulated DEGs. Twenty hub genes 
were identified, and 9 of them (ZWINT, MELK, DLGAP5, BIRC5, AURKA, HMMR, CDK1, 
TTK, and MAD2L1) were validated using the Cancer Genome Atlas data and 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. These genes were significantly associated with a 
poor prognosis in HCC patients. Our research shows that ZWINT, MELK, DLGAP5, 
BIRC5, AURKA, HMMR, CDK1, TTK, and MAD2L1 may be useful for predicting how 
HBV-associated HCC will progress and for finding new ways to treat it. In 
addition to these further studies are needed to elucidate the functions of the 
remaining 11 identified hub genes (RRM2, NUSAP1, PBK, CCNB1, CCNB2, BUB1B, NEK2, 
CENPF, ASPM, TOP2A, and BUB1) in HCC development and progression.

BACKGROUND: Cardiomyocyte senescence plays a crucial role as a pathological 
mechanism in heart failure (HF). However, the exact triggering factors and 
underlying causes of HF onset and progression are still not fully understood.
OBJECTIVES: By integrating multi-omics data, this study aimed to determine the 
genetic associations between cardiomyocyte and HF using cell senescence-related 
genes (SRGs).
METHODS: The study utilized the CellAge database and the SenMayo dataset, 
combined with high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, to 
identify SRG and examine differences in cardiac cell expression. To explore the 
causal relationship with HF using Mendelian Randomization (MR). Genetic 
variations influencing gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression 
(cis-eQTL, cis-mQTL, and cis-pQTL) were analyzed using the two-sample MR (TSMR) 
and summary-data-based MR (SMR). Additionally, Bayesian colocalization analysis, 
germline genetic variation, and bulk RNA data were employed to strengthen the 
reliability of the results. The application potential of therapeutic targets is 
ultimately assessed by evaluating their druggability.
RESULTS: The expression of 39 SRGs in cardiomyocytes was identified. In the 
discovery set revealed that CDKN1A (OR = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.02-1.15, FDR = 0.048) could be causally related to HF, and the results are 
also replicated in the validation set (OR = 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.10-1.30, FDR <0.0001). Based on the SMR method, CDKN1A was confirmed as a 
candidate pathogenic gene for HF, and its methylation (cg03714916, cg08179530) 
was associated with HF risk loci. The result is validated by Bayesian 
colocalization analysis, genetic variations, and bulk RNA data. The druggability 
analysis identified two potential therapeutic drugs.
CONCLUSION: Based on multi-omics data, this study uncovered the reciprocal 
regulation of cardiomyocyte senescence through CDKN1A, providing potential 
targets for HF drug development.

Age-related cataracts is a highly prevalent eye disorder that results in the 
clouding of the crystalline lens and is one of the leading causes of visual 
impairment and blindness. The disease is influenced by multiple factors 
including genetics, prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and a history 
of diabetes. However, the extent to which each of these factors contributes to 
the development of cataracts remains unclear. Our study identified 101 
independent genome-wide significant loci, 57 of which are novel. We identified 
multiple genes and biological pathways associated with the cataracts, including 
four drug-gene interactions. Our results suggest a causal association between 
type 1 diabetes and cataracts. Also, we highlighted a surrogate measure of UV 
light exposure as a marker of cataract risk in adults.

Cancer cells are heterogeneous, each harboring distinct molecular aberrations 
and are dependent on different genes for their survival and proliferation. While 
successful targeted therapies have been developed based on driver DNA mutations, 
many patient tumors lack druggable mutations and have limited treatment options. 
Here, we hypothesize that new precision oncology targets may be identified 
through "expression-driven dependency", whereby cancer cells with high 
expression of a targeted gene are more vulnerable to the knockout of that gene. 
We introduce a Bayesian approach, BEACON, to identify such targets by jointly 
analyzing global transcriptomic and proteomic profiles with genetic dependency 
data of cancer cell lines across 17 tissue lineages. BEACON identifies known 
druggable genes, e.g., BCL2, ERBB2, EGFR, ESR1, MYC, while revealing new targets 
confirmed by both mRNA- and protein-expression driven dependency. Notably, the 
identified genes show an overall 3.8-fold enrichment for approved drug targets 
and enrich for druggable oncology targets by 7 to 10-fold. We experimentally 
validate that the depletion of GRHL2, TP63, and PAX5 effectively reduce tumor 
cell growth and survival in their dependent cells. Overall, we present the 
catalog of express-driven dependency targets as a resource for identifying novel 
therapeutic targets in precision oncology.

PURPOSES: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors 
threatening human beings and has a poor prognosis. Therefore, exploring unveiled 
biomarkers or therapeutic targets for the diagnosis and treatment of GC is 
crucial.
METHODS: A total of 5772 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) were aggregated 
from four latest large-scale proteomics cohorts. Two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (two-sample MR) was utilized to identify the causal effect of 
blood plasma proteins on GC. Heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and directionality 
analyses were employed to evaluate proteins identified via two-sample MR. The 
robustness of results was further validated via colocalization. The drug targets 
of proteins were evaluated to reveal the compounds that can interfere with these 
proteins.
RESULTS: Ten proteins with potential causations in relation to GC were 
identified: LY6D, SLURP1, MLN, PSCA, THSD1, CFTR, PPM1B, KDM3A, TSC1, and HCG22. 
Among these proteins, LY6D, SLURP1, and THSD1 were considered as the most 
reliable biomarkers of GC due to their significant H4 posterior probabilities in 
colocalization analysis and absence of pleiotropy. Compound 35, nitrosamide, and 
0175029-0000 were potential drugs or small molecules targeting LY6D, SLURP1, and 
THSD1, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study identified several plasma proteins as potential 
biomarkers of GC and provided data support and new insights into the early 
diagnosis, intervention, and therapeutic targets of GC.

BACKGROUND: Keratoconus is an etiologically complex, degenerative corneal 
disease that eventually leads to loss of corneal integrity. Cells in corneal 
epithelium and endothelium express various types of ion channels that play 
important roles in ocular pathology. This emphasizes the need of understanding 
alterations of ion channels in keratoconus.
METHOD: Differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify 
deregulated ion channels in keratoconus patients using transcriptomic data. 
Thereafter correlation analysis of ion channel expression was performed to 
obtain the changed correlation between ion channels' expression in keratoconus 
patients versus control samples. Moreover, Protein-protein interaction networks 
and a pathway map was constructed to identify cellular processes altered due to 
the deregulation of ion channels. Furthermore, drugs interacting with 
deregulated ion channels were identified.
RESULTS: Total 75 ion channels were found to be deregulated in keratoconus, of 
which 12 were upregulated and 63 were downregulated. Correlations between ion 
channel expressions found to be different in control and keratoconus samples. 
Thereafter, protein-protein interactions network was generated to identify hub 
ion channels in network. Furthermore, the pathway map was constructed to depict 
calcium signalling, MAPK signalling, synthesis and secretion of cortisol, and 
cAMP signalling. The 19 FDA- approved drugs that interact with the 5 deregulated 
ion channels were identified.
CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of voltage-gated calcium channels can be attributed 
to reduced cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, deregulated ion 
channels in 3',5'- cyclic adenosine monophosphate signalling may be responsible 
for elevated cortisol level in progressive keratoconus patients.

Gene discoveries in obesity have largely been based on European cohorts, leading 
to an ancestral bias, that limits their generalizability across populations. We 
performed a gene-based rare variant association study of 721,941 individuals and 
identified 116 novel BMI-associated genes with consistent effects across 
ancestries, including 50 risk-conferring and 66 protective genes against 
obesity. Protective genes such as DCUN1D3 and NEUROD6 had effect sizes 
comparable to high-risk genes such as MC4R and BSN, and nearly twice that of 
known protective genes such as GPR75, which, along with five other genes, showed 
strong European bias. Notably, 82 of the 116 genes showed functional relevance 
to obesity including adiposity, energy homeostasis, and glucose metabolism. 
While polygenic risks or an obesogenic lifestyle amplified the effect of 15 
genes on BMI, including the combination of low physical activity and MACROD1, 23 
genes including VIRMA, AQP3, and PML retained protective effects even at high 
polygenic scores. Our findings provide further insights into the genetic basis 
of obesity that is conserved across ancestries and their interactions with 
obesogenic factors.

The study conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of differential 5mC and 
5hmC modifications at both CpG and non-CpG sites in postmortem orbitofrontal 
neurons from 25 PTSD cases and 13 healthy controls. It was observed that PTSD 
patients exhibit a greater number of differential 5hmC sites compared to 5mC 
sites. Specifically, individuals with PTSD tend to show hyper-5mC/5hmC at CpG 
sites, particularly within CpG islands and promoter regions, and hypo-5mC/5hmC 
at non-CpG sites, especially within intragenic regions. Functional enrichment 
analysis indicated distinct yet interconnected roles for 5mC and 5hmC in PTSD. 
The 5mC marks primarily regulate cell-cell adhesion processes, whereas 5hmC 
marks are involved in embryonic morphogenesis and cell fate commitment. By 
integrating published PTSD findings from central and peripheral tissues through 
multi-omics approaches, several biological mechanisms were prioritized, 
including developmental processes, HPA axis regulation, and immune responses. 
Based on the consistent enrichment in developmental processes, we hypothesize 
that if epigenetic changes occur during early developmental stages, they may 
increase the risk of developing PTSD following trauma exposure. Conversely, if 
these epigenetic changes occur in adulthood, they may influence neuronal 
apoptosis and survival mechanisms.

Background/Objectives: Intracranial Epidermoid Cysts (IECs) are rare 
intracranial tumors primarily treated through surgery. Cyst adherence 
complicates complete removal, leading to high rates of tumor progression after 
subtotal resection. The molecular drivers of IEC remain unknown. Consequently, 
advances in treatment have fallen short. Tumor genetic profiling has revealed 
potential targets for drug development, including FDA-approved options and 
reshaping treatment. The genetic landscape of IECs has not been explored. We 
applied Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to IECs to gain insights into the 
mechanisms of oncogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods: 
We performed WES on tumor tissue and matched blood samples, when available. 
Following GATK best practices, we conducted read processing, quality control, 
somatic variant calling, and copy-number inference. Data analyses and 
visualization were conducted in R. Results: Top altered genes are associated 
with the immune system and tumor microenvironment, suggesting a mechanism of 
immune evasion. Gene and pathway enrichment revealed a high mutation burden in 
genes associated with Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascades. 
Recurrent and deleterious alterations in NOTCH2 and USP8 were identified in 50% 
and 30% of the cohort, respectively. Frequent amplifications in deubiquitinases 
and beta-defensins strengthened the involvement of immune mechanisms for 
oncogenic transformation. Conclusions: Top altered genes and recurrent mutations 
may play a role in shaping the microenvironment and modulating immune evasion in 
IECs. USP8 and NOTCH2 may serve as clinically relevant target for IECs. Finally, 
we present evidence that the crosstalk between the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and ECM 
signaling pathways may play a role in modulating the immune escape mechanism in 
IECs.

Bladder cancer is among the most prevalent tumors in the urinary system and is 
known for its high malignancy. Although traditional diagnostic and treatment 
methods are established, recent research has focused on understanding the 
molecular mechanisms underlying bladder cancer. The primary objective of this 
study is to identify novel diagnostic markers and discover more effective 
targeted therapies for bladder cancer. This study identified differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between bladder cancer tissues and adjacent normal 
tissues using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Gene Ontology (GO) and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were 
conducted to explore the functional roles of these genes. A protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network was also constructed to identify and analyze hub genes 
within this network. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was conducted to 
investigate the involvement of these genes in various biological processes and 
pathways. Ten key genes were found to be significantly associated with bladder 
cancer: IL6, CCNA2, CCNB1, CDK1, PLK1, TOP2A, AURKA, AURKB, FOXM1, and CALML5. 
GSVA analyses revealed that these genes are involved in a variety of biological 
processes and signaling pathways, including coagulation, UV-response-down, 
apoptosis, Notch signaling, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. The diagnostic 
relevance of these genes was validated through ROC curve analysis. Additionally, 
potential therapeutic drug interactions with these key genes were identified. 
This study provides valuable insights into key genes and their roles in bladder 
cancer. The identified genes and their interactions with therapeutic drugs could 
serve as potential biomarkers, presenting new opportunities for enhancing the

BACKGROUND: Myocardial Infarction (MI) and severe mental disorders (SMDs) are 
two types of highly prevalent and complex disorders and seem to have a 
relatively high possibility of mortality. However, the contributions of common 
and rare genetic variants to their comorbidity arestill unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) and 
exome-wide association study (EWAS) approach.
RESULTS: Using gene-based and gene-set association analyses based on the results 
of GWAS, we found the common genetic underpinnings of nine genes (GIGYF2, 
KCNJ13, PCCB, STAG1, HLA-C, HLA-B, FURIN, FES, and SMG6) and nine pathways 
significantly shared between MI and SMDs. Through Mendelian randomization 
analysis, we found that twenty-seven genes were potential causal genes for SMDs 
and MI. Based on the exome sequencing data of MI and SMDs patients from the UK 
Biobank, we found that MUC2 was exome-wide significant in the two diseases. The 
gene-set analyses of the exome-wide association study indicated that pathways 
related to insulin processing androgen catabolic process and angiotensin 
receptor binding may be involved in the comorbidity between SMDs and MI. We also 
found that six candidate genes were reported to interact with known therapeutic 
drugs based on the drug-gene interaction information in DGIdb.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, this study revealed the overlap of common and rare 
genetic underpinning between SMDs and MI and may provide useful insights for 
their mechanism study and therapeutic investigations.

Exercise is increasingly recognized as an effective strategy to counteract 
skeletal muscle aging and conditions such as sarcopenia. However, the specific 
exercise-induced genes responsible for these protective effects remain unclear. 
To address this, we conducted an eight-week aerobic exercise regimen on 
late-middle-aged mice and developed an integrated approach that combines mouse 
exercise-induced genes with human GWAS datasets to identify causal genes for 
sarcopenia. This approach led to significant improvements in the skeletal muscle 
phenotype of the mice and the identification of exercise-induced genes and 
miRNAs. By constructing a miRNA regulatory network enriched with transcription 
factors and GWAS signals related to muscle function and traits, we focused on 
896 exercise-induced genes. Using human skeletal muscle cis-eQTLs as 
instrumental variables, 250 of these exercise-induced genes underwent two-sample 
Mendelian randomization analysis, identifying 40, 68, and 62 causal genes 
associated with sarcopenia and its clinical indicators-appendicular lean mass 
(ALM) and hand grip strength (HGS), respectively. Sensitivity analyses and 
cross-phenotype validation confirmed the robustness of our findings. 
Consistently across the three outcomes, RXRA, MDM1, RBL2, KCNJ2, and ADHFE1 were 
identified as risk factors, while NMB, TECPR2, MGAT3, ECHDC2, and GINM1 were 
identified as protective factors, all with potential as biomarkers for 
sarcopenia progression. Biological activity and disease association analyses 
suggested that exercise exerts its anti-sarcopenia effects primarily through the 
regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Based on available drug-gene interaction 
data, 21 of the causal genes are druggable, offering potential therapeutic 
targets. Our findings highlight key genes and molecular pathways potentially 
responsible for the anti-sarcopenia benefits of exercise, offering insights into 
future therapeutic strategies that could mimic the safe and mild protective 
effects of exercise on age-related skeletal muscle degeneration.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, 
accounting for over 90% of pancreatic cancers, and is characterized by limited 
treatment options and poor survival rates. Systems biology provides in-depth 
insights into the molecular mechanisms of PDAC. In this context, novel 
algorithms and comprehensive strategies are essential for advancing the 
identification of critical network nodes and therapeutic targets within 
disease-related protein-protein interaction networks. This study employed a 
comprehensive computational strategy using the metaheuristic algorithm Trader to 
enhance the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Analysis of the 
expression data from the PDAC dataset (GSE132956) involved co-expression 
analysis and clustering of differentially expressed genes to identify key 
disease-associated modules. The STRING database was used to construct a network 
of differentially expressed genes, and the Trader algorithm pinpointed the top 
30 DEGs whose removal caused the most significant network disconnections. 
Enriched gene ontology terms included "Signaling by Rho GTPases," "Signaling by 
receptor tyrosine kinases," and "immune system." Additionally, nine hub 
genes-FYN, MAPK3, CDK2, SNRPG, GNAQ, PAK1, LPCAT4, MAP1LC3B, and FBN1-were 
identified as central to PDAC pathogenesis. This integrated approach, combining 
co-expression analysis with protein-protein interaction network analysis using a 
metaheuristic algorithm, provides valuable insights into PDAC mechanisms and 
highlights several hub genes as potential therapeutic targets.

Visceral obesity (VO), characterized by excess fat around internal organs, is a 
recognized risk factor for gynecological tumors, including benign uterine 
leiomyoma (ULM) and malignant uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULS). Despite this 
association, the shared molecular mechanisms remain underexplored. This study 
utilizes an integrated bioinformatics approach to elucidate common molecular 
pathways and identify potential therapeutic targets linking VO, ULM, and ULS. We 
analyzed gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to 
identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each condition. We found 101, 
145, and 18 DEGs in VO, ULM, and ULS, respectively, with 37 genes overlapping 
across all three conditions. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these 
overlapping DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways related to cell 
proliferation, immune response, and transcriptional regulation, suggesting 
shared biological processes. Protein-protein interaction network analysis 
identified 14 hub genes, of which TOP2A, APOE, and TYMS showed significant 
differential expression across all three conditions. Drug-gene interaction 
analysis identified 26 FDA-approved drugs targeting these hub genes, 
highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities. In conclusion, this study 
uncovers shared molecular pathways and actionable drug targets across VO, ULM, 
and ULS. These findings deepen our understanding of disease etiology and offer 
promising avenues for drug repurposing. Experimental validation is needed to 
translate these insights into clinical applications and innovative treatments.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as a common geriatric disease in urology, the 
incidence and prevalence are rapidly increasing with the aging society, 
prompting an urgent need for effective prevention and treatment of BPH. However, 
limited therapeutic efficacy and higher risk of complications result in the 
treatment of BPH remaining challenging. The unclear pathogenic mechanism also 
hampers further exploration of therapeutic approaches for BPH. In this study, we 
used multi-omics methods to integrate genomics, transcriptomics, immunomics, and 
metabolomics data and identify biomolecules associated with BPH. We performed 
transcriptomic imputation, summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR), 
joint/conditional analysis, colocalization analysis, and FOCUS to explore 
high-confidence genes associated with BPH in blood and prostate tissue. 
Subsequently, three-step SMR was used to identify the DNA methylation sites 
regulating high-confidence genes to improve the pathogenic pathways of BPH. We 
also used cis-instruments of druggable genes to conduct SMR analysis to find 
potential drug targets for BPH. Finally, we used MR analysis to explore the 
immune pathways and metabolomics related to BPH. Multiple analytical methods 
identified BTN3A2 (Blood: TWAS Z score = 5.02912, TWAS P = 4.93 × 10-7; 
Prostate: TWAS Z score = 4.89, TWAS P = 1.01 × 10-6) and C4A (Blood: TWAS Z 
score = 4.90754, TWAS P = 9.22 × 10-7; Prostate: TWAS Z score = 5.084, TWAS 
P = 3.70 × 10-7) as high-confidence genes for BPH and identified the 
cg14345882-BTN3A2-BPH pathogenic pathway. We also used druggable gene data to 
identify 30 promising therapeutic target genes, including BTN3A2 and C4A. For MR 
analysis of immune pathways, we identified immune cell surface molecules as well 
as the inflammatory factor IL-17 (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.09-1.43, PFDR = 0.12, 
Maximum likelihood) as risk factors for BPH. In addition, we found that 
disulfide levels of cysteinylglycine (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.05-1.18, 
P = 5.18 × 10-4, Weighted median), oxidation levels of cysteinylglycine 
(OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04-1.14, P = 3.87 × 10-4, Weighted median), and sebacate 
levels (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02-1.08, P = 3.0 × 10-4, Maximum likelihood) 
increase the risk of BPH. This multi-omics study explored biomolecules 
associated with BPH, improved the pathogenic pathways of BPH, and identified 
promising therapeutic targets. Our results provide evidence for future studies 
aimed at developing appropriate therapeutic interventions.

Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a pivotal factor in the 
development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. While correlations 
between inflammatory cytokines and these diseases are documented, the definitive 
causal dynamics remain to be elucidated. We explored the causal association 
between 91 circulating inflammatory cytokines and Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's 
disease (PD) through Mendelian randomization analysis. Leveraging genetic 
variants from the most comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
available for these cytokines, AD, ALS, MS and PD, we sought to uncover the 
causality. Our study validated a causal influence of genetically determined 
cytokine levels on the susceptibility to AD, with notable cytokines including 
C-X-C motif chemokine 1 (OR = 0.9993, p = 0.0424), Interleukin-18 (OR = 0.9994, 
p = 0.0186), Leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (OR = 0.9993, p = 0.0122) and 
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (OR = 0.9992, p = 0.0026) in risk 
attenuation. Additionally, a positive causal relationship was identified between 
two cytokines-C-C motif chemokine 19 (OR = 1.0005, p = 0.0478) and Fms-related 
tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (OR = 1.0005, p = 0.0210)-and AD incidence. Conversely, 
transforming growth factor-alpha (OR = 0.8630, p = 0.0298), CD40L receptor 
(OR = 0.7737, p = 1.1265E-09) and Interleukin-12 subunit beta (OR = 0.8987, 
p = 0.0333) showed inverse associations with ALS, MS and PD, respectively. The 
consistency observed in various MR analyses, alongside sensitivity analysis, 
underscored the absence of horizontal pleiotropy, thus supporting our causal 
findings. This study reveals, for the first time, a genetically anchored causal 
nexus between levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines and the risk of 
neurodegenerative diseases.

The basal ganglia are subcortical brain structures involved in motor control, 
cognition, and emotion regulation. We conducted univariate and multivariate 
genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) to explore the genetic architecture of 
basal ganglia volumes using brain scans obtained from 34,794 Europeans with 
replication in 4,808 white and generalization in 5,220 non-white Europeans. Our 
multivariate GWAS identified 72 genetic loci associated with basal ganglia 
volumes with a replication rate of 55.6% at P < 0.05 and 87.5% showed the same 
direction, revealing a distributed genetic architecture across basal ganglia 
structures. Of these, 50 loci were novel, including exonic regions of APOE, NBR1 
and HLAA. We examined the genetic overlap between basal ganglia volumes and 
several neurological and psychiatric disorders. The strongest genetic overlap 
was between basal ganglia and Parkinson's disease, as supported by robust 
LD-score regression-based genetic correlations. Mendelian randomization 
indicated genetic liability to larger striatal volume as potentially causal for 
Parkinson's disease, in addition to a suggestive causal effect of greater 
genetic liability to Alzheimer's disease on smaller accumbens. Functional 
analyses implicated neurogenesis, neuron differentiation and development in 
basal ganglia volumes. These results enhance our understanding of the genetic 
architecture and molecular associations of basal ganglia structure and their 
role in brain disorders.

We leveraged information from more than 1.2 million participants, including 
97,383 cases, to investigate the genetics of anxiety disorders across five 
continental groups. Through ancestry-specific and cross-ancestry genome-wide 
association studies, we identified 51 anxiety-associated loci, 39 of which were 
novel. In addition, polygenic risk scores derived from individuals of European 
descent were associated with anxiety in African, admixed American and East Asian 
groups. The heritability of anxiety was enriched for genes expressed in the 
limbic system, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, metencephalon, entorhinal cortex and 
brain stem. Transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide analyses highlighted 115 genes 
associated with anxiety through brain-specific and cross-tissue regulation. 
Anxiety also showed global and local genetic correlations with depression, 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and widespread pleiotropy with several 
physical health domains. Overall, this study expands our knowledge regarding the 
genetic risk and pathogenesis of anxiety disorders, highlighting the importance

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease 
accompanied by both local and systemic comorbidities. Genetic factors play a 
role in the development of IPF and certain associated comorbidities. 
Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether there are shared genetic factors 
underlying IPF and these comorbidities. To bridge this knowledge gap, we 
conducted a systematic investigation into the shared genetic architecture 
between IPF and ten prevalent heritable comorbidities (i.e., body mass index 
[BMI], coronary artery disease [CAD], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
[COPD], gastroesophageal reflux disease, lung cancer, major depressive disorder 
[MDD], obstructive sleep apnoea, pulmonary hypertension [PH], stroke, and type 2 
diabetes), by utilizing large-scale summary data from their respective 
genome-wide association studies and multi-omics studies. We revealed significant 
(false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) and moderate genetic correlations between 
IPF and seven comorbidities, excluding lung cancer, MDD and PH. Evidence 
suggested a partially putative causal effect of IPF on CAD. Notably, we observed 
FDR-significant genetic enrichments in lung for the cross-trait between IPF and 
CAD and in liver for the cross-trait between IPF and COPD. Additionally, we 
identified 65 FDR-significant genes over-represented in 20 biological pathways 
related to the etiology of IPF, BMI, and COPD, including inflammation-related 
mucin gene clusters. Several of these genes were associated with clinically 
relevant drugs for the treatment of IPF, CAD, and/or COPD. Our results 
underscore the pervasive shared genetic basis between IPF and its common 
comorbidities and hold future implications for early diagnosis of IPF-related 
comorbidities, drug repurposing, and the development of novel therapies for IPF.

PURPOSE: Early dissemination of primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
is the main cause of dismal prognosis as it highly limits possible treatment 
options. A number of PDAC patients experience distant metastasis even after 
treatment due to the metastatic clones. We aimed to demonstrate the molecular 
architecture of borderline resectable PDAC manifests cancer dissemination of 
PDAC.
METHODS: Here, 36 organoids isolated from primary tumor masses of PDAC patients 
with diverse metastatic statues are presented. Whole-exome sequencing and RNA 
sequencing were performed and drug responses to clinically relevant 18 compounds 
were assessed.
RESULTS: Our results revealed that borderline resectable PDAC organoids 
exhibited distinct patterns according to their metastatic potency highlighted by 
multiple genetic and transcriptional factors and strong variances in drug 
responses.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the presence of metastatic PDAC can be 
identified by integrating molecular compositions and drug responses of 
borderline resectable PDAC.

It remains challenging to translate the findings from genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) into interventional targets, 
presumably due to the lack of knowledge on how the GWAS risk variants contribute 
to AIDs. In addition, current immunomodulatory drugs for AIDs are broad in 
action rather than disease-specific. We performed a comprehensive 
protein-centric omics integration analysis to identify AIDs-associated plasma 
proteins through integrating protein quantitative trait loci datasets of plasma 
protein (1348 proteins and 7213 individuals) and totally ten large-scale GWAS 
summary statistics of AIDs under a cutting-edge systematic analytic framework. 
Specifically, we initially screened out the protein-AID associations using 
proteome-wide association study (PWAS), followed by enrichment analysis to 
reveal the underlying biological processes and pathways. Then, we performed both 
Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses to further identify 
protein-AID pairs with putatively causal relationships. We finally prioritized 
the potential drug targets for AIDs. A total of 174 protein-AID associations 
were identified by PWAS. AIDs-associated plasma proteins were significantly 
enriched in immune-related biological process and pathways, such as inflammatory 
response (P = 3.96 × 10-10). MR analysis further identified 97 protein-AID pairs 
with potential causal relationships, among which 21 pairs were highly supported 
by colocalization analysis (PP.H4 > 0.75), 10 of 21 were the newly discovered 
pairs and not reported in previous GWAS analyses. Further explorations showed 
that four proteins (TLR3, FCGR2A, IL23R, TCN1) have corresponding drugs, and 17 
proteins have druggability. These findings will help us to further understand 
the biological mechanism of AIDs and highlight the potential of these proteins 
to develop as therapeutic targets for AIDs.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a worldwide burden. 
Cuproptosis has been shown to play a key role in the development of several 
diseases. However, the role and mechanisms of cuproptosis in ALD remain unclear.
METHODS: The RNA-sequencing data of ALD liver samples were downloaded from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Bioinformatical analyses were performed 
using the R data package. We then identified key genes through multiple machine 
learning methods. Immunoinfiltration analyses were used to identify different 
immune cells in ALD patients and controls. The expression levels of key genes 
were further verified.
RESULTS: We identified three key cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) (DPYD, 
SLC31A1, and DBT) through an in-depth analysis of two GEO datasets, including 28 
ALD samples and eight control samples. The area under the curve (AUC) value of 
these three genes combined in determining ALD was 1.0. In the external datasets, 
the three key genes had AUC values as high as 1.0 and 0.917, respectively. 
Nomogram, decision curve, and calibration curve analyses also confirmed these 
genes' ability to predict the diagnosis. These three key genes were found to be 
involved in multiple pathways associated with ALD progression. We confirmed the 
mRNA expression of these three key genes in mouse ALD liver samples. Regarding 
immune cell infiltration, the numbers of B cells, CD8 (+) T cells, NK cells, 
T-helper cells, and Th1 cells were significantly lower in ALD patient samples 
than in control liver samples. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis 
(ssGSEA) was then used to estimate the immune microenvironment of different CRG 
clusters and CRG-related gene clusters. In addition, we calculated CRG scores 
through principal component analysis (PCA) and selected Sankey plots to 
represent the correlation between CRG clusters, gene clusters, and CRG scores. 
Finally, the three key genes were confirmed in mouse ALD liver samples and liver 
cells treated with ethanol.
CONCLUSIONS: We first established a prognostic model for ALD based on 3 CRGs and 
robust prediction efficacy was confirmed. Our investigation contributes to a 
comprehensive understanding of the role of cuproptosis in ALD, presenting 
promising avenues for the exploration of therapeutic strategies.

Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most common malignancies and a leading cause 
of death among women worldwide. The ubiquitin pathway plays an important role in 
OC development. Using the single nucleotide polymorphism data obtained using the 
prevalence and dominance strategies, four ubiquitin marker genes were identified 
according to their expression levels: BARD1, BRCA2, FANCA, and BRCA1. Based on 
these four genes, a consensus clustering of OC expression data was performed. 
The significant differences in the survival analysis, ESTIMATE, and CIBERSORT 
results among the clusters indicated the pivotal role of these four genes in OC 
development. Of the ubiquitin-representative genes in each cluster, two 
ubiquitin genes, TOP2A and MYLIP, were identified in the survival risk model 
after univariate survival, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator 
regression, and multivariate survival analyses. The reliability and robustness 
of both the training and validation data were confirmed by comparing the 
significant survival difference between high- and low-risk patients. We further 
explored the association between our risk model and clinical outcomes as well as 
predicted potentially interacting drugs. The co-expression network showed clear 
interactions among the four marker genes and two model genes and between high- 
and low-risk differentially expressed genes. Significantly enriched genes were 
found in pathways associated with ion channels, channel activity, and 
neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. Therefore, suggesting the involvement 
of ubiquitin genes in the survival and development of OC through neurohumoral 
regulation. Our results will provide valuable reference or supplementary 
information for studies investigating OC diagnosis and therapies.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze and validate differential genes in the cytokine-cytokine 
receptor interaction CCRI pathway in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) 
using bioinformatics and Mendelian randomization (MR) to find potential 
biomarkers for LSCC.
METHODS: Five sets of LSCC-related gene chips were downloaded from the GEO 
database, and four sets of combined datasets were randomly selected as the test 
set and one set as the validation set to screen for differential genes in the 
CCRI pathway; two-way Mendelian randomization was performed to analyze the 
causal relationship between cytokine receptor as the exposure factor and LSCC as 
the outcome variable; and the causal relationship was analyzed by DGIdb, 
Miranda, miRDB, miRWalk, TargetScan, spongeScan, and TISIDB databases to analyze 
the relationship between differential genes and drugs, immune cell infiltration, 
and mRNA-miNA-lncRNA interactions.
RESULTS: A total of 7 differentially expressed genes CD27, CXCL2, CXCL9, INHBA, 
IL6, CXCL11, and TNFRSF17 were screened for enrichment in the CCRI signaling 
pathway; MR analysis showed that the CCRI receptor was a risk factor for LSCC 
(IVW: OR = 1.629, 95 % CI:1.060-2.504, P = 0.026); Seven differential genes were 
correlated with drugs, immune cells and mRNA-miNA-lncRNA, respectively; the CCRI 
differential gene expression analysis in the validation set was consistent with 
the test set results.
CONCLUSION: This study provided CCRI differential gene expression by 
bioinformatics, and MR analysis demonstrated that cytokine receptors are risk 
factors for LSCC, providing new ideas for the pathogenesis and therapeutic 
targets of LSCC.

The pathogenesis of ocular diseases (ODs) remains unclear, although genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous associated genetic risk 
loci. We integrated protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) datasets and five 
large-scale GWAS summary statistics of ODs under a cutting-edge systematic 
analytic framework. Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) identified plasma 
and brain proteins associated with ODs, and 11 plasma proteins were identified 
by Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization (COLOC) analyses as being 
potentially causally associated with ODs. Five of these proteins (protein-coding 
genes ECI1, LCT, and NPTXR for glaucoma, WARS1 for age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD), and SIGLEC14 for diabetic retinopathy (DR)) are newly 
reported. Twenty brain-protein-OD pairs were identified by COLOC analysis. Eight 
pairs (protein-coding genes TOM1L2, MXRA7, RHPN2, and HINT1 for senile cataract, 
WARS1 and TDRD7 for AMD, STAT6 for myopia, and TPPP3 for DR) are newly reported 
in this study. Phenotype-disease mapping analysis revealed 10 genes related to 
the eye/vision phenotype or ODs. Combined with a drug exploration analysis, we 
found that the drugs related to C3 and TXN have been used for the treatment of 
ODs, and another eight genes (GSTM3 for senile cataract, IGFBP7 and CFHR1 for 
AMD, PTPMT1 for glaucoma, EFEMP1 and ACP1 for myopia, SIRPG and CTSH for DR) are 
promising targets for pharmacological interventions. Our study highlights the 
role played by proteins in ODs, in which brain proteins were taken into account 
due to the deepening of eye-brain connection studies. The potential pathogenic 
proteins finally identified provide a more reliable reference range for 
subsequent medical studies.

BACKGROUND: Genetics has the potential to inform biologically relevant drug 
treatment and repurposing which may ultimately improve patient care. In this 
study, we combine methods which leverage the genetics of psychiatric disorders 
to prioritize potential drug targets and compounds.
METHODS: We used the largest available genome-wide association studies, in 
European ancestry, of four psychiatric disorders [i.e., attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia] 
along with genes encoding drug targets. With this data, we conducted drug 
enrichment analyses incorporating the novel and biologically specific GSA-MiXeR 
tool. We then conducted a series of molecular trait analyses using large-scale 
transcriptomic and proteomic datasets sampled from brain and blood tissue. This 
included the novel use of the UK Biobank proteomic data for a proteome-wide 
association study of psychiatric disorders. With the accumulated evidence, we 
prioritize potential drug targets and compounds for each disorder.
FINDINGS: We reveal candidate drug targets shared across multiple disorders as 
well as disorder-specific targets. Drug prioritization indicated genetic support 
for several currently used psychotropic medications including the antipsychotic 
paliperidone as the top ranked drug for schizophrenia. We also observed genetic 
support for other commonly used psychotropics (e.g., clozapine, risperidone, 
duloxetine, lithium, and valproic acid). Opportunities for drug repurposing were 
revealed such as cholinergic drugs for ADHD, estrogens for depression, and 
gabapentin enacarbil for schizophrenia. Our findings also indicate the genetic 
liability to schizophrenia is associated with reduced brain and blood expression 
of CYP2D6, a gene encoding a metabolizer of drugs and neurotransmitters, 
suggesting a genetic risk for poor drug response and altered neurotransmission.
INTERPRETATION: Here we present a series of complimentary and comprehensive 
analyses that highlight the utility of genetics for informing drug development 
and repurposing for psychiatric disorders. Our findings present novel 
opportunities for refining psychiatric treatment.

BACKGROUND: There is considerable comorbidity between externalizing (EXT) and 
internalizing (INT) psychopathology. Understanding the shared genetic 
underpinnings of these spectra is crucial for advancing knowledge of their 
biological bases and potential health impacts, and for informing empirical 
models like the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) and Hierarchical Taxonomy of 
Psychopathology (HiTOP).
METHODS: We conducted a multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) of EXT 
and INT psychopathology by applying genomic structural equation modeling to 
summary statistics from 16 EXT and INT traits in European-ancestry individuals 
(n = 16,400 to 1,074,629). Downstream analyses explored associations across RDoC 
units of analysis (i.e., genes, molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, and 
behaviors).
RESULTS: The GWAS identified 409 lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 
EXT, 85 for INT, and 256 for EXT+INT (i.e., shared) traits. Bivariate causal 
mixture models estimated that nearly all EXT and INT causal variants overlapped, 
despite a genetic correlation of 0.37 (SE = 0.02). Drug repurposing analyses 
identified potential therapeutic targets, including perturbagens affecting 
dopamine and serotonin pathways. EXT genes had enriched expression in GABAergic, 
cortical, and hippocampal neurons, while INT genes were more narrowly linked to 
GABAergic neurons. EXT+INT liability was associated with reduced grey matter 
volumes in the amygdala and subcallosal cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal both genetic overlap and distinct molecular 
and neurobiological pathways underlying EXT and INT psychopathology. By 
integrating genomic insights with the RDoC and HiTOP frameworks, this study 
advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving these dimensions of 
psychopathology.

Graph databases are becoming increasingly popular across scientific disciplines, 
being highly suitable for storing and connecting complex heterogeneous data. In 
systems biology, they are used as a backend solution for biological data 
repositories, ontologies, networks, pathways, and knowledge graph databases. In 
this review, we analyse all publications using or mentioning graph databases 
retrieved from PubMed and PubMed Central full-text search, focusing on the top 
16 available graph databases, Publications are categorized according to their 
domain and application, focusing on pathway and network biology and relevant 
ontologies and tools. We detail different approaches and highlight 
the advantages of outstanding resources, such as UniProtKB, Disease Ontology, 
and Reactome, which provide graph-based solutions. We discuss ongoing efforts of 
the systems biology community to standardize and harmonize knowledge graph 
creation and the maintenance of integrated resources. Outlining prospects, 
including the use of graph databases as a way of communication between 
biological data repositories, we conclude that efficient design, querying, and 
maintenance of graph databases will be key for knowledge generation in systems 
biology and other research fields with heterogeneous data.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic 
signals associated with autoimmune disease. The majority of these signals are 
located in non-coding regions and likely impact cis-regulatory elements (cRE). 
Because cRE function is dynamic across cell types and states, profiling the 
epigenetic status of cRE across physiological processes is necessary to 
characterize the molecular mechanisms by which autoimmune variants contribute to 
disease risk. We localized risk variants from 15 autoimmune GWAS to cRE active 
during TCR-CD28 co-stimulation of naïve human CD4+ T cells. To characterize how 
dynamic changes in gene expression correlate with cRE activity, we measured 
transcript levels, chromatin accessibility, and promoter-cRE contacts across 
three phases of naive CD4+ T cell activation using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and HiC. 
We identified ~1200 protein-coding genes physically connected to accessible 
disease-associated variants at 423 GWAS signals, at least one-third of which are 
dynamically regulated by activation. From these maps, we functionally validated 
a novel stretch of evolutionarily conserved intergenic enhancers whose activity 
is required for activation-induced IL2 gene expression in human and mouse, and 
is influenced by autoimmune-associated genetic variation. The set of genes 
implicated by this approach are enriched for genes controlling CD4+ T cell 
function and genes involved in human inborn errors of immunity, and we 
pharmacologically validated eight implicated genes as novel regulators of T cell 
activation. These studies directly show how autoimmune variants and the genes 
they regulate influence processes involved in CD4+ T cell proliferation and 
activation.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is a 
life-threatening autoimmune disease that often results in kidney failure caused 
by crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). To date, treatment of most patients with 
ANCA-GN relies on non-specific immunosuppressive agents, which may have serious 
adverse effects and be only partially effective. Here, using spatial and 
single-cell transcriptome analysis, we characterize inflammatory niches in 
kidney samples from 34 patients with ANCA-GN and identify proinflammatory, 
cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a pathogenic signature. We then 
utilize these transcriptomic profiles for digital pharmacology and identify 
ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12 and IL-23, as the strongest 
therapeutic drug to use. Moreover, four patients with relapsing ANCA-GN are 
treated with ustekinumab in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide and 
steroids, with ustekinumab given subcutaneously (90 mg) at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 
24. Patients are followed up for 26 weeks to find this treatment well-tolerated 
and inducing clinical responses, including improved kidney function and 
Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, in all ANCA-GN patients. Our findings thus 
suggest that targeting of pathogenic T cells in ANCA-GN patients with 
ustekinumab might represent a potential approach and warrants further 
investigation in clinical trials.

Cancer is a subject of extensive investigation, and the utilization of omics 
technology has resulted in the generation of substantial volumes of big data in 
cancer research. Numerous databases are being developed to manage and organize 
this data effectively. These databases encompass various domains such as 
genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, immunology, and drug 
discovery. The application of computational tools into various core components 
of pharmaceutical sciences constitutes "Pharmacoinformatics", an emerging 
paradigm in rational drug discovery. The three major features of 
pharmacoinformatics include (i) Structure modelling of putative drugs and 
targets, (ii) Compilation of databases and analysis using statistical 
approaches, and (iii) Employing artificial intelligence/machine learning 
algorithms for the discovery of novel therapeutic molecules. The development, 
updating, and analysis of databases using statistical approaches play a pivotal 
role in pharmacoinformatics. Multiple software tools are associated with 
oncoinformatics research. This review catalogs the databases and computational 
tools related to cancer drug discovery and highlights their potential 
implications in the pharmacoinformatics of cancer.

Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc), an autosomal recessive disorder, is associated 
with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. Previous studies were focused 
around exploring the functional annotation of VPS13A gene in ChAc, whereas the 
genetic labyrinth underlying this disease and plausible drug targets were 
underexplored. In the present study, we have identified the pivotal genes and 
molecular pathways implicated in ChAc using comprehensive bioinformatics 
analysis. In our analysis we found 27 distinct genes in Homo sapiens linked to 
ChAc, out of which 15 were selected as candidate genes for enrichment analysis 
based on their Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and involvement in relevant 
molecular pathways. By constructing a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network 
consisting of 26 nodes and 62 edges, we identified two gene modules. 
Subsequently, using the MCODE algorithm, we identified 6 hub genes-ATN1, JPH3, 
TBP, VPS13A, DMD, and HTT-as core candidates. These hub genes are primarily 
associated with processes such as neuron development and differentiation, the 
CAMKK-AMPK signaling cascade, ion transmembrane transport systems, and protein 
localization. Furthermore, using drug gene databank we identified 23 
FDA-approved drugs that possess the propensity to target 3 out of the 6 
identified hub genes. We believe that our findings could open promising avenues 
for potential therapeutic interventions in ChAc.

Most cancer types lack targeted therapeutic options, and when first-line 
targeted therapies are available, treatment resistance is a huge challenge. 
Recent technological advances enable the use of assay for transposase-accessible 
chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on patient 
tissue in a high-throughput manner. Here, we present a computational approach 
that leverages these datasets to identify drug targets based on tumor lineage. 
We constructed gene regulatory networks for 371 patients of 22 cancer types 
using machine learning approaches trained with three-dimensional genomic data 
for enhancer-to-promoter contacts. Next, we identified the key transcription 
factors (TFs) in these networks, which are used to find therapeutic 
vulnerabilities, by direct targeting of either TFs or the proteins that they 
interact with. We validated four candidates identified for neuroendocrine, 
liver, and renal cancers, which have a dismal prognosis with current therapeutic 
options.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a global health threat, with the oral 
microbiome increasingly implicated in its pathogenesis. This study leverages 
Mendelian Randomization (MR) to explore causal links between oral microbiota and 
CRC using data from the China National GeneBank and Biobank Japan. By 
integrating multi-omics approaches, we aim to uncover mechanisms by which the 
microbiome influences cellular metabolism and cancer development.
METHODS: We analyzed microbiome profiles from 2017 tongue and 1915 saliva 
samples, and GWAS data for 6692 CRC cases and 27178 controls. Significant 
bacterial taxa were identified via MR analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing and 
enrichment analyses elucidated underlying pathways, and drug predictions 
identified potential therapeutics.
RESULTS: MR identified 19 bacterial taxa significantly associated with CRC. 
Protective effects were observed in taxa like RUG343 and 
Streptococcus_umgs_2425, while HOT-345_umgs_976 and W5053_sp000467935_mgs_712 
increased CRC risk. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed key pathways, including 
JAK-STAT signaling and tyrosine metabolism. Drug prediction highlighted 
potential therapeutics like Menadione Sodium Bisulfite and Raloxifene.
CONCLUSION: This study establishes the critical role of the oral microbiome in 
colorectal cancer development, identifying specific microbial taxa linked to CRC 
risk. Single-cell RNA sequencing and drug prediction analyses further elucidate 
key pathways and potential therapeutics, providing novel insights and 
personalized treatment strategies for CRC.

BACKGROUND: The proteome is a crucial reservoir of targets for cancer treatment. 
While some targeted therapies have been developed, there are still significant 
challenges in early diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the need to identify 
new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Therefore, we 
conducted a comprehensive proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to 
identify novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer.
METHODS: Protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) data were extracted from two 
published plasma proteome-wide association studies. Genetic variants associated 
with breast cancer were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, 
which included 133,384 cases and 113,789 controls, and the Finnish cohort study, 
comprising 18,786 cases and 182,927 controls. We employed summary-based MR and 
colocalization methods to identify potential drug targets for breast cancer, 
which were subsequently validated using a two-sample MR approach. Finally, a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to detect interactions 
between the identified proteins and existing cancer drug targets.
RESULTS: Gene-predicted levels of ten proteins were associated with breast 
cancer risk. Decreased levels of CASP8, DDX58, CPNE1, ULK3, PARK7, and BTN2A1, 
as well as increased levels of TNFRSF9, TNXB, DNPH1, and TLR1, were linked to an 
elevated risk of breast cancer. Among these, CASP8 and DDX58 were supported by 
tier-one evidence, while CPNE1, ULK3, PARK7, and TNFRSF9 received tier-two 
evidence support. The remaining proteins, TNXB, BTN2A1, DNPH1, and TLR1, were 
supported by tier-three evidence. CASP8, DDX58, CPNE1, ULK3, PARK7, and TNFRSF9 
have already been identified as targets in drug development and potential 
therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment. Additionally, ULK3 showed 
promise as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified several novel potential drug targets 
and biomarkers for breast cancer, providing new insights into its diagnosis and 
treatment. The integration of PPI and druggability evaluations enhances the 
prioritization of these therapeutic targets, paving the way for future drug 
development efforts.

BACKGROUND: Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is a severe cerebrovascular disease, and 
effective gene therapy and drug interventions for its treatment are still 
lacking. Oxidative stress (OS) is closely associated with the IA, but the key 
regulatory genes involved are still unclear. Through multiomics analysis and 
experimental validation, we identified two diagnostic markers for IA associated 
with OS.
METHODS: In this study, we first analyzed the IA dataset GSE75436 and conducted 
a joint analysis of oxidative stress-related genes (ORGs). Differential 
analysis, functional enrichment analysis, immune infiltration, WGCNA, PPI, 
LASSO, and other methods were used to identify IA diagnostic markers related to 
OS. Next, the functions of TLR4 and ALOX5 expression in IA and their potential 
targeted therapeutic drugs were analyzed. We also performed single-cell 
sequencing of patient IA and control (superficial temporal artery, STA) tissues. 
23,342 cells were captured from 2 IA and 3 STA samples obtained from our center. 
Cell clustering and annotation were conducted using R software to observe the 
distribution of TLR4 and ALOX5 expression in IAs. Finally, the expression of 
TLR4 and ALOX5 were validated in IA patients and in an elastase-induced mouse IA 
model using experiments such as WB and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified 16 key ORGs associated 
with IA pathogenesis. Further screening revealed that ALOX5 and TLR4 were highly 
expressed to activate a series of inflammatory responses and reduce the 
production of myocytes. Methotrexate (MTX) may be a potential targeted drug. 
Single-cell analysis revealed a notable increase in immune cells in the IA 
group, with ALOX5 and TLR4 primarily localized to monocytes/macrophages. 
Validation through patient samples and mouse models confirmed high expression of 
ALOX5 and TLR4 in IAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Bioinformatics analysis indicated that ALOX5 and TLR4 are the most 
significant ORGs associated with the pathogenesis of IA. Single-cell sequencing 
and experiments revealed that the high expression of ALOX5 and TLR4 are closely 
related to IA. These two genes are promising new targets for IA therapy.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a serious health hazard and identified as 
the second leading cause of mortality around the world. However, the role of 
pyroptosis in the immune microenvironment regulation in IS is still unclear. 
Here, our study aims to elucidate the effect of pyroptosis on immune 
microenvironment in IS.
METHODS: The regulation mode of pyroptosis in IS was systematically evaluated, 
and its effects on immune microenvironment were explored, including infiltration 
of immune cells, immune response gene sets, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
gene. The genes and drugs related to pyroptosis phenotype were also identified. 
An MCAO rat model was constructed, and the mRNA expression levels in the 
classifier model were validated by qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: The separator is composed of 11 pyroptosis genes, out of which 10 genes 
could distinguish between ischemic stroke and control samples. CHMP2A, CHMP4A, 
and NAIP genes are significantly related to immune infiltrating cells, immune 
response gene sets, and HLA. However, two different pyroptosis subtypes mediated 
by 10 pyroptosis genes were identified, which were different in immune cell 
abundance, HLA genes, and immune response gene sets. Furthermore, 199 genes 
associated with pyroptosis phenotype was identified along with the analysis of 
biological functions.
CONCLUSION: These findings reveal the potential mechanism of pyroptosis in the 
immune microenvironment of IS, indicating that pyroptosis functions as a vital 
component in the complexity and diversity of the immune microenvironment in 
patients with IS.

Recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are increasingly favored for gene therapy due to 
their useful features of vectorology, such as transfection of dividing and 
nondividing cells, the presence of tissue-specific serotypes, and biosafety 
considerations. This study investigates the impact of commonly used therapeutic 
drugs-acetaminophen, budesonide, and simvastatin-on rAAV transduction efficiency 
in HEK-293 cells. Cells were transduced with an AAV mosaic vector under the 
control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter encoding green fluorescent protein 
(GFP). Transduction efficiency was assessed by qPCR and fluorescent microscopy. 
Analysis of functional interactions between genes potentially involved in rAAV 
transduction in drug-exposed cells was also performed. This study showed a clear 
effect of drugs on rAAV transmission. Notably, acetaminophen enhanced 
transduction efficiency by 9-fold, while budesonide and simvastatin showed 
2-fold and 3-fold increases, respectively. The gene analysis illustrates the 
possible involvement of genes related to cell membranes in the potentiation of 
rAAV transduction induced by the drugs under investigation. Attention should be 
paid to S100A8, which is a common drug-modified gene for drugs showing 
anti-inflammatory effects (budesonide and simvastatin), demonstrating an 
interaction with the gene encoding the receptor for AAV (HGFR). This study 
underscores the significance of assessing rAAV pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics 
(PKs/PDs) and drug-gene therapy interactions in optimizing gene therapy 
protocols.

Increasing evidence suggests that patients with diabetes are at increased risk 
of developing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the underlying mechanisms 
that affect the progression of NASH remain unclear. In this study, we used 
bioinformatics and network pharmacology methods to explore the differentially 
expressed genes of NASH and the related genes of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a 
total of 46 common targets were obtained. Gene ontology showed that the common 
targets were mainly involved in biological processes such as glucocorticoid, 
hormone, and bacterium responses. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
enrichment analysis signal pathways were mainly in colorectal cancer, 
amphetamine addition, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling 
pathway, and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The protein-protein 
interaction network identified 8 hub genes, and the co-expression network was 
analyzed to obtain 7 related functions and mutual proportions of hub genes. A 
total of 120 transcription factors were predicted for hub genes. Hub genes were 
closely related to immune cells, including neutropils and eosinophils. In 
addition, we identified 15 potential candidate drugs based on hub genes that are 
promising for the treatment of NASH. Type 2 diabetes mellitus can affect the 
progression of NASH by changing hormone levels and inflammatory responses 
through multiple targets and signaling pathways. Eight hub genes are expected to 
be potential targets for subsequent treatment.

Due to the transformation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and 
technologies, AI-driven drug discovery has come to the forefront. It reduces the 
time and expenditure. Due to these advantages, pharmaceutical industries are 
concentrating on AI-driven drug discovery. Several drug molecules have been 
discovered using AI-based techniques and tools, and several newly AI-discovered 
drug molecules have already entered clinical trials. In this review, we first 
present the data and their resources in the pharmaceutical sector for AI-driven 
drug discovery and illustrated some significant algorithms or techniques used 
for AI and ML which are used in this field. We gave an overview of the deep 
neural network (NN) models and compared them with artificial NNs. Then, we 
illustrate the recent advancement of the landscape of drug discovery using AI to 
deep learning, such as the identification of drug targets, prediction of their 
structure, estimation of drug-target interaction, estimation of drug-target 
binding affinity, design of de novo drug, prediction of drug toxicity, 
estimation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity; and 
estimation of drug-drug interaction. Moreover, we highlighted the success 
stories of AI-driven drug discovery and discussed several collaboration and the 
challenges in this area. The discussions in the article will enrich the 
pharmaceutical industry.

BACKGROUND: Severe burns can lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome 
(SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to 
inflammation-immunity dysregulation. This study aimed to identify key 
immune-related molecules and potential drugs for immune regulation in severe 
burn treatment.
METHOD: Microarray datasets GSE77791 and GSE37069 were analyzed to identify 
immune-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs), enriched pathways and 
prognosis-related genes. The DGIdb database was used to identify potentially 
clinically relevant small molecular drugs for hub DEGs. Hub DEGs were validated 
by total RNA from clinical blood samples through qPCR. The efficacy of drug 
candidates was tested in a severe burn mouse model. Pathologic staining was used 
to observe organ damage. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to 
detect the serum IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a and MCP-1 contents. Activation of the NF-κB 
inflammatory pathway was detected by western blotting. Transcriptome sequencing 
was used to observe inflammatory-immune responses in the lung.
RESULTS: A total of 113 immune-related DEGs were identified, and the presence of 
immune overactivation was confirmed in severe burns. S100A8 was not only 
significantly upregulated and identified to be prognosis-related among the hub 
DEGs but also exhibited an increasing trend in clinical blood samples. 
Methotrexate, which targets S100A8, as predicted by the DGIdb, significantly 
reduces transcription level of S100A8 and inflammatory cytokine content in 
blood, organ damage (lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys) and mortality in 
severely burned mice when combined with fluid resuscitation. The 
inflammatory-immune response was suppressed in the lungs.
CONCLUSION: S100A8 with high transcription level in blood is a potential 
biomarker for poor severe burn prognosis. It suggested that methotrexate has a 
potential application in severe burn immunotherapy. Besides, it should be 
emphasized that fluid resuscitation is necessary for the function of 
methotrexate.

Psoriasis is a globally prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease. This study 
aimed to scrutinize the hub genes related to inflammation and potential 
molecular mechanisms in psoriasis. Utilizing mRNA expression profiles from 
public datasets GSE13355, GSE78097, and GSE14905, we set up a comprehensive 
analysis. Initially, we selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 
psoriasis and control samples in GSE13355, followed by calculating inflammatory 
indices using genomic set variation analysis (GSVA). Weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA) was then applied to link significant modules with the 
inflammatory index. This process helped us identify differentially expressed 
inflammation-related genes (DE-IRGs). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network was established, with the molecular complex detection (MCODE) plug-in 
pinpointing six chemokine genes (CCR7, CCL2, CCL19, CXCL8, CXCL1, and CXCL2) as 
central hub genes. These genes demonstrated pronounced immunohistochemical 
staining in psoriatic tissues compared to normal skin. Notably, the CCR7 gene 
exhibited the highest potential for m6A modification sites. Furthermore, we 
constructed transcription factor-microRNA-mRNA networks, identifying 139 
microRNAs and 52 transcription factors associated with the hub genes. For the 
LASSO logistic regression model, the area under the curve (AUC) in the training 
set was 1, and in the two validation cohorts GSE78097 and GSE14905 were 1 and 
0.872, respectively. In conclusion, our study highlights six chemokine genes 
(CCR7, CCL2, CCL19, CXCL8, CXCL1, and CXCL2) as potential biomarkers in 
psoriasis, providing insights into the immune and inflammatory responses as 
pivotal instances in disease pathogenesis. These findings pave the way for 
exploring new therapeutic targets, particularly focusing on chemokine-associated 
pathways in psoriasis treatment.

Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease, which causes of high mortality rate in 
women. Early diagnosis and therapeutic improvements may reduce the mortality 
rate. There were more than 74 individual studies that have suggested BC-causing 
hub-genes (HubGs) in the literature. However, we observed that their HubG sets 
are not so consistent with each other. It may be happened due to the regional 
and environmental variations with the sample units. Therefore, it was required 
to explore hub of the HubG (hHubG) sets that might be more representative for 
early diagnosis and therapies of BC in different country regions and their 
environments. In this study, we selected top-ranked 10 HubGs (CCNB1, CDK1, 
TOP2A, CCNA2, ESR1, EGFR, JUN, ACTB, TP53, and CCND1) as the hHubG set by the 
protein-protein interaction network analysis based on all of 74 individual HubG 
sets. The hHubG set enrichment analysis detected some crucial biological 
processes, molecular functions, and pathways that are significantly associated 
with BC progressions. The expression analysis of hHubGs by box plots in 
different stages of BC progression and BC prediction models indicated that the 
proposed hHubGs can be considered as the early diagnostic and prognostic 
biomarkers. Finally, we suggested hHubGs-guided top-ranked 10 candidate drug 
molecules (SORAFENIB, AMG-900, CHEMBL1765740, ENTRECTINIB, MK-6592, YM201636, 
masitinib, GSK2126458, TG-02, and PAZOPANIB) by molecular docking analysis for 
the treatment against BC. We investigated the stability of top-ranked 3 
drug-target complexes (SORAFENIB vs ESR1, AMG-900 vs TOP2A, and CHEMBL1765740 vs 
EGFR) by computing their binding free energies based on 100-ns molecular dynamic 
(MD) simulation based Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area 
(MM-PBSA) approach and found their stable performance. The literature review 
also supported our findings much more for BC compared with the results of 
individual studies. Therefore, the findings of this study may be useful 
resources for early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapies of BC.

Subcellular protein localization regulates protein function and can be corrupted 
in cancers1 and neurodegenerative diseases2,3. The rewiring of localization to 
address disease-driving phenotypes would be an attractive targeted therapeutic 
approach. Molecules that harness the trafficking of a shuttle protein to control 
the subcellular localization of a target protein could enforce targeted protein 
relocalization and rewire the interactome. Here we identify a collection of 
shuttle proteins with potent ligands amenable to incorporation into targeted 
relocalization-activating molecules (TRAMs), and use these to relocalize 
endogenous proteins. Using a custom imaging analysis pipeline, we show that 
protein steady-state localization can be modulated through molecular coupling to 
shuttle proteins containing sufficiently strong localization sequences and 
expressed in the necessary abundance. We analyse the TRAM-induced relocalization 
of different proteins and then use nuclear hormone receptors as shuttles to 
redistribute disease-driving mutant proteins such as SMARCB1Q318X, TDP43ΔNLS and 
FUSR495X. TRAM-mediated relocalization of FUSR495X to the nucleus from the 
cytoplasm correlated with a reduction in the number of stress granules in a 
model of cellular stress. With methionyl aminopeptidase 2 and poly(ADP-ribose) 
polymerase 1 as endogenous cytoplasmic and nuclear shuttles, respectively, we 
demonstrate relocalization of endogenous PRMT9, SOS1 and FKBP12. 
Small-molecule-mediated redistribution of nicotinamide nucleotide 
adenylyltransferase 1 from nuclei to axons in primary neurons was able to slow 
axonal degeneration and pharmacologically mimic the genetic WldS 
gain-of-function phenotype in mice resistant to certain types of 
neurodegeneration4. The concept of targeted protein relocalization could 
therefore inspire approaches for treating disease through interactome rewiring.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease, which lead to 
various findings in transcriptomic research. This study addresses these 
challenges by integrating 34 datasets, including 26 control groups, 6 prognostic 
datasets and 2 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets to identify 
10,000 AML-related genes (ARGs). We focused on genes with low variability and 
high consistency and successfully discovered 191 AML signatures (ASs). 
Leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost model and our 
custom framework, we classified AML subtypes with both scRNA-seq and bulk 
RNA-seq data, complementing the ELN2022 classification approach. Our research 
also identified promising treatments for AML through drug repurposing, with 
solasonine showing potential efficacy for high-risk AML patients, supported by 
molecular docking and transcriptomic analyses. To enhance reproducibility and 
customizability, we developed CSAMLdb, a user-friendly database platform. It 
facilitates the reuse and personalized analysis of nearly all results obtained 
in this research, including single-gene prognostics, multi-gene scoring, 
enrichment analysis, machine learning risk assessment, drug repositioning 
analysis and literature abstract named entity recognition. CSAMLdb is available 
at http://www.csamldb.com.

Osteosarcoma, one of the most common primary malignancies in children and 
adolescents, has the primary characteristics of a poor prognosis and high rate 
of metastasis. This study used super-enhancer-related genes derived from two 
different cell lines to construct five novel super-enhancer-related gene 
prognostic models for patients with osteosarcoma. The training and testing 
datasets were used to confirm the prognostic models of the five 
super-enhancer-related genes, which resulted in an impartial predictive element 
for osteosarcoma. The immunotherapy and prediction of the response to anticancer 
drugs have shown that the risk signature of the five super-enhancer-related 
genes positively correlate with chemosensitivity. Furthermore, functional 
analysis of the risk signature genes revealed a significant relationship between 
gene groups and the malignant characteristics of tumours. TNF Receptor 
Superfamily Member 11b (TNFRSF11B) was selected for functional verification. 
Silencing of TNFRSF11B suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of 
osteosarcoma cells in vitro and suppressed osteosarcoma growth in vivo. 
Moreover, transcriptome sequencing was performed on MG-63 cells to study the 
regulatory mechanism of TNFRSF11B in osteosarcoma cells, and it was discovered 
that TNFRSF11B is involved in the development of osteosarcoma via the 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase signalling pathway. Following the identification of 
TNFRSF11B as a key gene, we selected an inhibitor that specifically targeted 
this gene and performed molecular docking simulations. In addition, risedronic 
acid inhibited osteosarcoma growth at both cellular and molecular levels. In 
conclusion, the super-enhancer-related gene signature is a viable therapeutic 
tool for osteosarcoma prognosis and treatment.

Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anticancer drug, but its use is limited by 
dose-dependent heart toxicity. Quercetin is a natural antioxidant frequently 
studied for its beneficial properties. Moreover, a wide range of dietary 
supplements are available for human use. This in vivo study aimed to explore the 
potential cardioprotective effects of quercetin in chronic DOX treatment. A 
total of 32 Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, DOX, 
DOX/Q-50, and DOX/Q-100, treated with saline, 2.5 mg/kg body-weight DOX, 2.5 
mg/kg body-weight DOX + 50 mg quercetin, and 2.5 mg/kg body-weight DOX + 100 mg 
quercetin, respectively, for two weeks. Rats were monitored using cardiac 
ultrasound (US) and markers for cardiac injury. Oxidative damage and 
ultrastructural changes in the heart were investigated. Chronic DOX treatment 
led to a decline in cardiac function and elevated values of NT pro-BNP, troponin 
I, and CK-MB. Quercetin treatment slightly improved certain US parameters, and 
normalized serum NT pro-BNP levels. Furthermore, DOX-induced SOD1 depletion with 
consequent Nrf2 activation and DNA damage as shown by an increase in γH2AX and 
8HOdG. Quercetin treatment alleviated these alterations. Oral administration of 
quercetin alleviated serum markers associated with DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. 
Furthermore, it exhibited a favorable impact on the cardiac US parameters. This 
suggests that quercetin may have potential cardioprotective properties.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is responsible for most cancer-related deaths, and 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of cases. Targeted 
therapy has made promising advancements in systemic treatment for NSCLC over the 
last two decades, but inadequate drug targets with clinically proven survival 
benefits limit its universal application in clinical practice compared to 
chemotherapy and immunotherapy. There is an urgent need to explore new drug 
targets to expand the beneficiary group. This study aims to identify druggable 
genes and to predict the efficacy and prognostic value of the corresponding 
targeted drugs in NSCLC.
METHODS: Two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) of druggable genes was 
performed to predict the efficacy of their corresponding targeted therapy for 
NSCLC. Subsequent sensitivity analyses were performed to assess potential 
confounders. Accessible RNA sequencing data were incorporated for subsequent 
verifications, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves of different gene expressions 
were used to explore the prognostic value of candidate druggable genes.
RESULTS: MR screening encompassing 4,863 expression quantitative trait loci 
(eQTL) and 1,072 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL, with 453 proteins 
overlapping) were performed. Seven candidate druggable genes were identified, 
including CD33, ENG, ICOSLG and IL18R1 for lung adenocarcinoma, and VSIR, FSTL1 
and TIMP2 for lung squamous cell carcinoma. The results were validated by 
further transcriptomic investigations.
CONCLUSIONS: Drugs targeting genetically supported genomes are considerably more 
likely to yield promising efficacy and succeed in clinical trials. We provide 
compelling genetic evidence to prioritize drug development for NSCLC.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension are global public health concerns and 
major metabolic disorders in humans. Experimental evidence indicates 
considerable hereditary influences on the etiology of T2D and hypertension, but 
the molecular basis of these diseases is still limited. Thus, the current study 
analyzed 185 (132 T2D and 53 hypertension) GWAS catalog datasets and identified 
83 common genes linked to T2D and hypertension pathogenesis. These genes were 
further examined using various bioinformatics approaches to elucidate their 
molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of T2D and hypertension. 
Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed the biological, cellular, and molecular 
functions of these genes, which were also linked to different T2D and 
hypertension pathways. Specifically, seven genes were found to be crucial for 
T2D, and nine were directly associated with hypertension. Protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) analysis identified 28 candidate genes and seven hub genes 
through 11 topological methods. Among 231 miRNAs, seven were significant in 
interacting with the hub genes, and nine transcription factors (TFs) out of 36 
were linked to these hub genes. Additionally, two of the seven hub genes were 
downregulated by 43 FDA-approved drugs. These findings elucidate the molecular 
processes underlying T2D and hypertension, suggesting that targeting these genes 
could lead to future drug development and therapeutic strategies to treat T2D 
and hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a common neurological disorder, and 
circulating plasma proteins with causal genetic evidence are a major source of 
therapeutic targets. This study identifies several potential plasma proteins 
that are causally related to PN risk, providing new insights into 
protein-mediated pathogenesis of PN and potential targets for novel therapies.
METHODS: To identify potential therapeutic targets for PN, we employed 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify plasma proteins associated 
with six common PN. First, we screened for proteins related to PN using 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS), obtaining genetic data on plasma 
proteomes from 35,559 Icelanders. Summary data for six common PN, including 
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN), Alcoholic Neuropathy 
(AIP), Drug-induced Neuropathy (DIP), Diabetic Neuropathy (DP), and 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), were obtained from the FinnGen database. 
Two-sample MR and colocalization analyses were then conducted to further 
identify protein-PN pairs with presumed causal relationships. Enrichment 
analysis of positive proteins revealed potential biological processes and 
pathways. Based on drug-gene interaction analysis, we ultimately identified 
causal proteins associated with PN that could serve as potential drug targets 
for treating PN.
RESULTS: Through MR analysis, we identified eight proteins (UBC12, SEM4C, IL23R, 
Prothrombin, CBS, Microglobulin, MATN4, COLEC12) with causal relationships to 
PN. We found that UBC12 is a protective factor for DP and CTS, while the 
remaining proteins are risk factors. Further colocalization analysis showed a 
posterior probability of hypothesis 4 (PPH4) less than 0.75, indicating no 
positive colocalization results were found. From the pathway enrichment 
analysis, we discovered that the proteins were mainly concentrated in pathways 
related to defense response to bacterium, receptor signaling pathway via STAT, 
cell killing, negative regulation of cytokine production, and leukocyte mediated 
immunity. Finally, in Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb), we identified 
three protein-coding genes (IL23R, F2, CBS) as potential drug targets for PN.
CONCLUSION: Mendelian randomization studies confirm the causal relationship 
between genetically predicted PN-related risk and genetically predicted plasma 
protein abundance. Plasma proteins, as biomarkers associated with PN, can 
provide potential drug targets for etiological intervention research in PN.

EWS fusion oncoproteins underlie several human malignancies including 
Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT), an aggressive cancer driven by 
EWS-WT1 fusion proteins. Here we combine chromatin occupancy and 3D profiles to 
identify EWS-WT1-dependent gene regulation networks and target genes. We show 
that EWS-WT1 is a powerful chromatin activator controlling an oncogenic gene 
expression program that characterizes primary tumors. Similar to wild type WT1, 
EWS-WT1 has two isoforms that differ in their DNA binding domain and we find 
that they have distinct DNA binding profiles and are both required to generate 
viable tumors that resemble primary DSRCT. Finally, we identify candidate 
EWS-WT1 target genes with potential therapeutic implications, including CCND1, 
whose inhibition by the clinically-approved drug Palbociclib leads to marked 
tumor burden decrease in DSRCT PDXs in vivo. Taken together, our studies 
identify gene regulation programs and therapeutic vulnerabilities in DSRCT and 
provide a mechanistic understanding of the complex oncogenic activity of 
EWS-WT1.

Treatment response and resistance in major depressive disorder (MDD) show a 
significant genetic component, but previous studies had limited power also due 
to MDD heterogeneity. This literature review focuses on the genetic factors 
associated with treatment outcomes in MDD, exploring their overlap with those 
associated with clinically relevant symptom dimensions. We searched PubMed for: 
(1) genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or whole exome sequencing studies 
(WESs) that investigated efficacy outcomes in MDD; (2) studies examining the 
association between MDD treatment outcomes and specific depressive symptom 
dimensions; and (3) GWASs of the identified symptom dimensions. We identified 13 
GWASs and one WES of treatment outcomes in MDD, reporting several significant 
loci, genes, and gene sets involved in gene expression, immune system 
regulation, synaptic transmission and plasticity, neurogenesis and 
differentiation. Nine symptom dimensions were associated with poor treatment 
outcomes and studied by previous GWASs (anxiety, neuroticism, anhedonia, 
cognitive functioning, melancholia, suicide attempt, psychosis, sleep, 
sociability). Four genes were associated with both treatment outcomes and these 
symptom dimensions: CGREF1 (anxiety); MCHR1 (neuroticism); FTO and NRXN3 
(sleep). Other overlapping signals were found when considering genes 
suggestively associated with treatment outcomes. Genetic studies of treatment 
outcomes showed convergence at the level of biological processes, despite no 
replication at gene or variant level. The genetic signals overlapping with 
symptom dimensions of interest may point to shared biological mechanisms and 
potential targets for new treatments tailored to the individual patient's 
clinical profile.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Investigating the shared brain protein and genetic 
components of schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar I disorder (BD-I) presents a 
unique opportunity to understand the underlying pathophysiological processes and 
pinpoint potential drug targets.
STUDY DESIGN: To identify overlapping susceptibility brain proteins in SCZ and 
BD-I, we carried out proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) and Mendelian 
Randomization (MR) by integrating human brain protein quantitative trait loci 
with large-scale genome-wide association studies for both disorders. We utilized 
transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to determine the consistency of 
mRNA-protein dysregulation in both disorders. We applied pleiotropy-informed 
conditional false discovery rate (pleioFDR) analysis to identify common risk 
genetic loci for SCZ and BD-I. Additionally, we performed a cell-type-specific 
analysis in the human brain to detect risk genes notably enriched in distinct 
brain cell types. The impact of risk gene overexpression on dendritic 
arborization and axon length in neurons was also examined.
STUDY RESULTS: Our PWAS identified 42 proteins associated with SCZ and 14 with 
BD-I, among which NEK4, HARS2, SUGP1, and DUS2 were common to both conditions. 
TWAS and MR analysis verified the significant risk gene NEK4 for both SCZ and 
BD-I. PleioFDR analysis further supported genetic risk loci associated with NEK4 
for both conditions. The cell-type specificity analysis revealed that NEK4 is 
expressed on the surface of glutamatergic neurons, and its overexpression 
enhances dendritic arborization and axon length in cultured primary neurons.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore a shared genetic origin for SCZ and BD-I, 
offering novel insights for potential therapeutic target identification.

Integrating protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data and summary statistics 
from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of brain image-derived phenotypes 
(IDPs) can benefit in identifying IDP-related proteins. Here, we developed a 
systematic omics-integration analytic framework by sequentially using 
proteome-wide association study (PWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and 
colocalization (COLOC) analyses to identify the potentially causal brain and 
plasma proteins for IDPs, followed by pleiotropy analysis, mediation analysis, 
and drug exploration analysis to investigate potential mediation pathways of 
pleiotropic proteins to neuropsychiatric disorders (NDs) as well as candidate 
drug targets. A total of 201 plasma proteins and 398 brain proteins were 
significantly associated with IDPs from PWAS analysis. Subsequent MR and COLOC 
analyses further identified 313 potentially causal IDP-related proteins, which 
were significantly enriched in neural-related phenotypes, among which 91 were 
further identified as pleiotropic proteins associated with both IDPs and NDs, 
including EGFR, TMEM106B, GPT, and HLA-B. Drug prioritization analysis showed 
that 6.33% of unique pleiotropic proteins had drug targets or interactions with 
medications for NDs. Nine potential mediation pathways were identified to 
illustrate the mediating roles of the IDPs in the causal effect of the 
pleiotropic proteins on NDs, including the indirect effect of TMEM106B on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk via radial diffusivity (RD) of the posterior limb 
of the internal capsule (PLIC), with the mediation proportion being 11.18%, and 
the indirect effect of EGFR on AD through RD of PLIC, RD of splenium of corpus 
callosum (SCC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) of SCC, with the mediation 
proportion being 18.99%, 22.79%, and 19.91%, respectively. These findings 
provide novel insights into pathogenesis, drug targets, and neuroimaging 
biomarkers of NDs.

BACKGROUND: Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experience 
higher risk of adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. This study explores shared 
loci, and genes between PTSD and CV conditions from three major domains: CV 
diagnoses from electronic health records (CV-EHR), cardiac and aortic imaging, 
and CV health behaviors defined in Life's Essential 8 (LE8).
METHODS: We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PTSD (N=1,222,882), 246 
CV diagnoses based on EHR data from Million Veteran Program (MVP; N=458,061), UK 
Biobank (UKBB; N=420,531), 82 cardiac and aortic imaging traits (N=26,893), and 
GWAS of traits defined in the LE8 (N = 282,271 ~ 1,320,016). Shared loci between 
PTSD and CV conditions were identified using local genetic correlations (rg), 
and colocalization (shared causal variants). Overlapping genes between PTSD and 
CV conditions were identified from genetically regulated proteome expression in 
brain and blood tissues, and subsequently tested to identify functional pathways 
and gene-drug targets. Epidemiological replication of EHR-CV diagnoses was 
performed in AllofUS cohort (AoU; N=249,906).
RESULTS: Among the 76 PTSD-susceptibility risk loci, 33 loci exhibited local rg 
with 45 CV-EHR traits (|rg|≥0.4), four loci with eight heart imaging 
traits(|rg|≥0.5), and 44 loci with LE8 factors (|rg|≥0.36) in MVP. Among 
significantly correlated loci, we found shared causal variants (colocalization 
probability > 80%) between PTSD and 17 CV-EHR (in MVP) at 11 loci in MVP, that 
also replicated in UKBB and/or other cohorts. Of the 17 traits, the 
observational analysis in the AoU showed PTSD was associated with 13 CV-EHR 
traits after accounting for socioeconomic factors and depression diagnosis. PTSD 
colocalized with eight heart imaging traits on 2 loci and with LE8 factors on 31 
loci. Leveraging blood and brain proteome expression, we found 33 and 122 genes, 
respectively, shared between PTSD and CVD. Blood proteome genes were related to 
neuronal and immune processes, while the brain proteome genes converged on 
metabolic and calcium-modulating pathways (FDR p <0.05). Drug repurposing 
analysis highlighted DRD2, NOS1, GFAP, and POR as common targets of psychiatric 
and CV drugs.
CONCLUSION: PTSD-CV comorbidities exhibit shared risk loci, and genes involved 
in tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms.

We evaluated the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition on 
prostate cancer by evidence triangulation. Using Mendelian randomization, we 
found that genetically proxied SGLT2 inhibition reduced the risk of overall 
(odds ratio = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38 to 0.82; 79,148 prostate 
cancer cases and 61,106 controls), advanced, and early-onset prostate cancer. 
Using electronic healthcare data (nSGLT2i = 24,155; nDPP4i = 24,155), we found 
that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a 23% reduced risk of 
prostate cancer (hazard ratio = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.99) in men with 
diabetes. Using data from two prospective cohorts (n4C = 57,779; nUK_Biobank = 
165,430), we found little evidence to support the association of HbA1c with 
prostate cancer, implying a non-glycemic effect of SGLT2 inhibition on prostate 
cancer. In summary, this study provides multiple layers of evidence to support 
the beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibition on reducing prostate cancer risk. 
Future trials are warranted to investigate whether SGLT2 inhibitors can be 
recommended for prostate cancer prevention.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify novel therapeutic targets for primary 
open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
METHODS: The summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method was used to 
evaluate the genetic association between plasma proteins and POAG. Two sets of 
plasma protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) data considered exposures were 
obtained from the Icelandic Decoding Genetics Study and UK Biobank Pharma 
Proteomics Project. The summary-level genome-wide association studies data for 
POAG were extracted from the latest Round 10 release of the FinnGen consortium 
(8,530 cases and 391,275 controls) and the UK Biobank (4,737 cases and 458,196 
controls). Colocalization analysis was used to screen out pQTLs that share the 
same variant with POAG as drug targets identified. The two-sample Mendelian 
randomization, reverse causality testing and phenotype scanning were performed 
to further validate the main findings. Protein-protein interaction, pathway 
enrichment analysis and druggability assessment were conducted to determine 
whether the identified plasma proteins have potential as drug targets.
RESULTS: After systematic analysis, this study identified eight circulating 
proteins as potential therapeutic targets for POAG. Three causal proteins with 
strong evidence of colocalization, ROBO1 (OR = 1.38, p = 1.48 × 10-4, PPH4 = 
0.865), FOXO3 (OR = 0.35, p = 4.34 × 10-3, PPH4 = 0.796), ITIH3 (OR = 0.89, p = 
2.76 × 10-4, PPH4 = 0.767), were considered tier one targets. Five proteins with 
medium support evidence of colocalization, NCR1 (OR = 1.25, p = 4.18 × 10-4, 
PPH4 = 0.682), NID1 (OR = 1.38, p = 1.54 × 10-3, PPH4 = 0.664), TIMP3 (OR = 
0.91, p = 4.01 × 10-5, PPH4 = 0.659), SERPINF1 (OR = 0.81, p = 2.77 × 10-4, PPH4 
= 0.59), OXT (OR = 1.17, p = 9.51 × 10-4, PPH4 = 0.526), were classified as tier 
two targets. Additional sensitivity analyses further validated the robustness 
and directionality of these findings. According to druggability assessment, 
Pimagedine, Resveratrol, Syringaresinol and Clozapine may potentially be 
important in the development of new anti-glaucoma agents.
CONCLUSION: Our integrated study identified eight potential associated proteins 
for POAG. These proteins play important roles in neuroprotection, extracellular 
matrix regulation and oxidative stress. Therefore, they have promising potential 
as therapeutic targets to combat POAG.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease that is 
characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairment. Evidence shows that 
depression is a common co-occurrence in AD patients, and major depressive 
disorder (MDD) is considered a risk factor for AD. The crosstalk between the 
biological procedures related to the two disorders makes it very difficult to 
treat the comorbid conditions caused by them. Considering the common 
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD and MDD, antidepressant drugs may 
have beneficial therapeutic effects against their concurrence. In this study, we 
aimed to explore the potential drug candidates for the prevention and treatment 
of the comorbidity of AD and MDD. First, we screened the potential drugs for 
treating MDD by evaluating the distances of drug targets to MDD-related genes on 
the human protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) via a network-based 
algorithm. Then, the drugs were further screened to identify those that may be 
effective for AD treatment by analyzing their affinities with tau protein and 
Aβ42 peptide via molecular docking. Furthermore, the most stable binding modes 
were identified via molecular dynamics simulations, and the regulatory effects 
of drug candidates on genes involved in the pathogenesis of AD and MDD were 
analyzed. A total of 506 MDD-related genes were retrieved, and 831 drug 
candidates for MDD treatment were screened via the network-based approach. The 
results from molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated 
dihydroergotamine had the lowest binding affinity with tau protein and 
bromocriptine could form the most stable binding mode with Aβ42 peptide. Further 
analyses found that both dihydroergotamine and bromocriptine could regulate the 
expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of AD and/or MDD in the brain. 
The exact mechanisms of the two drugs in treating AD and MDD, as well as their 
comorbidity, are still unclear, and further exploration is needed to evaluate 
their roles and mechanisms, both in vitro and in vivo. This study revealed that 
dihydroergotamine and bromocriptine may be the potential drug candidates for the 
treatment of the comorbidity of AD and MDD, and the therapeutic effects may be 
achieved by inhibiting the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ42 and tau protein 
and regulating the expression of disease-related genes in the brain.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) and Osteoarthritis (OA) are both 
prevalent diseases that significantly impact the health of patients. Increasing 
evidence suggests that there is a big correlation between T2D and OA, but the 
molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The aims of this study are to investigate 
the shared biomarkers and potential molecular mechanisms in T2D combined with 
OA.
METHODS: T2D and OA-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
identified via bioinformatic analysis on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets 
GSE26168 and GSE114007 respectively. Subsequently, extensive target prediction 
and network analysis were finished with Gene Ontology (GO), protein-protein 
interaction (PPI), and pathway enrichment with DEGs. The transcription factors 
(TFs) and miRNAs coupled in co-expressed DEGs involved in T2D and OA were 
predicted as well. The key genes expressed both in the clinical tissues of T2D 
and OA were detected with western blot and qRT-PCR assay. Finally, the most 
promising candidate compounds were predicted with the Drug-Gene Interaction 
Database (DGIdb) and molecular docking.
RESULTS: In this study, 209 shared DEGs between T2D and OA were identified. 
Functional analysis disclosed that these DEGs are predominantly related to 
ossification, regulation of leukocyte migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) 
structural constituents, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt signaling pathways. Further analysis 
via Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis and validation with external 
datasets emphasized MMP9 and ANGPTL4 as crucial genes in both T2D and OA. Our 
findings were validated through qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, which 
indicated high expression levels of these pivotal genes in T2D, OA, and T2D 
combined with OA cases. Additionally, the analysis of Transcription Factors 
(TFs)-miRNA interactions identified 7 TFs and one miRNA that jointly regulate 
these important genes. The Receiver Operating characteristic (ROC) analysis 
demonstrated the significant diagnostic potential of MMP9 and ANGPTL4.Moreover, 
we identified raloxifene, ezetimibe, and S-3304 as promising agents for patients 
with both T2D and OA.
CONCLUSION: This study uncovers the shared signaling pathways, biomarkers, 
potential therapeutics, and diagnostic models for individuals suffering from 
both T2D and OA. These findings not only present novel perspectives on the 
complex interplay between T2D and OA but also hold significant promise for 
improving the clinical management and prognosis of patients with this concurrent 
condition.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and breast cancer pose significant risks to 
human health. The reasons behind the concurrent occurrence of AF and breast 
cancer remain unclear, leading to complex treatment approaches. Mendelian 
Randomization (MR) analyses aim to offer genetic evidence supporting the 
causation of AF and breast cancer and to investigate common druggable genes 
associated with both conditions.
METHODS: We used two-samples of MR to sequentially explore the causal 
relationship between atrial fibrillation and breast cancer, and between atrial 
fibrillation and breast cancer therapeutic drugs, and verified the stability of 
the results through colocalization analysis. We utilized the Connectivity map 
database to infer the direction of drug effects on disease. Finally, we explored 
druggable genes that play a role in AF and breast cancer and performed a 
Phenome-wide MR analysis to analyze the potential side effects of drug targets.
RESULTS: We found 15 breast cancer therapeutic drugs that significantly support 
a causal association between AF and breast cancer through expression in blood 
and/or atrial appendage tissue. Among these, activation of ANXA5 by Docetaxel, 
inhibition of EIF5A by Fulvestrant, and inhibition of GNA12 by Tamoxifen 
increased the risk of AF, while inhibition of ANXA5 by Gemcitabine and 
Vinorebine and inhibition of PCGF6 by Paclitaxel reduced the risk of AF. 
Inhibition of MSH6 and SF3B1 by Cyclophosphamide, as well as inhibition of SMAD4 
and PSMD2 and activation of ASAH1 and MLST8 by Doxorubicin can have 
bidirectional effects on AF occurrence. XBP1 can be used as a common druggable 
gene for AF and breast cancer, and there are no potential side effects of 
treatment against this target.
CONCLUSION: This study did not find a direct disease causality between AF and 
breast cancer but identified 40 target genes for 15 breast cancer therapeutic 
drugs associated with AF, clarified the direction of action of 8 breast cancer 
therapeutic drugs on AF, and finally identified one common druggable target for 
AF and breast cancer.

Sonic hedgehog subgroup of medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) is characterized by aberrant 
activation of the SHH signaling pathway. An inhibition of the positive SHH 
regulator Smoothened (SMO) has demonstrated promising clinical efficacy. Yet, 
primary and acquired resistance to SMO inhibitors limit their efficacy. An 
understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance to therapy is 
warranted to bridge this unmet need. Here, we make use of genome-wide 
CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in murine SMB21 and human DAOY cells, in order to 
unravel genetic dependencies and drug-related genetic interactors that could 
serve as alternative therapeutic targets for SHH-MB. Our screens reinforce SMB21 
cells as a faithful model system for SHH-MB, as opposed to DAOY cells, and 
identify members of the epigenetic machinery including DNA methyltransferase 1 
(DNMT1) as druggable targets in SHH-dependent tumors. We show that Dnmt1 plays a 
crucial role in normal murine cerebellar development and is required for SHH-MB 
growth in vivo. Additionally, DNMT1 pharmacological inhibition alone and in 
combination with SMO inhibition effectively inhibits tumor growth in murine and 
human SHH-MB cell models and prolongs survival of SHH-MB mouse models by 
inhibiting SHH signaling output downstream of SMO. In conclusion, our data 
highlight the potential of inhibiting epigenetic regulators as a novel 
therapeutic avenue in SMO-inhibitor sensitive as well as resistant SHH-MBs.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, which 
can lead to cognitive impairment and dementia. Since AD is tightly associated 
with aging and cellular senescence, objective of this study was to investigate 
the association between senescence-related genes and proteins (SRGs and SRPs) 
and the development of AD.
DESIGN: The whole study was based on transcriptomic analysis of control and AD 
brain tissues and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.
METHODS: For transcriptomic analysis, GSE5281 dataset from GEO database contains 
the transcriptomic data of human brain tissues (n = 161) from control group and 
AD patients. The expression of SRGs in control and AD brain tissues were 
compared by Student's t test. For MR analysis, the instrumental 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 110 SRPs were filtered 
and selected from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) for plasma 
proteome. The causality between plasma levels of SRPs and AD was explored using 
GWAS data of AD from Lambert et al. (17,008 cases and 37,154 controls) and 
further validated by using data from FinnGen consortium (6,489 patients and 
170,489 controls). MR estimate was performed using the inverse-variance weighted 
(IVW) method and the heterogeneity and pleiotropy of results were tested.
RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis identified 36 up-regulated (including PLAUR) 
and 8 down-regulated SRGs in AD brain tissues. In addition, the MR results at 
both discovery and validation stages supported the causality between plasma 
levels of PLAUR (IVW-p = 3.04E-2, odds ratio [OR] = 1.15), CD55 
(IVW-p = 1.56E-3, OR = 0.86), and SERPINE2 (IVW-p = 2.74E-2, OR = 0.91) and the 
risk of AD.
CONCLUSION: Our findings identified that PLAUR, as an SRG, may take part in the 
development of AD and found that high plasma levels of PLAUR was associated with 
increased risk of AD, indicating that this gene was a risk factor for this 
disease and providing the rationale of existing drugs or new preventative and 
therapeutic strategies.

MOTIVATION: Drug-target interactions (DTIs) hold a pivotal role in drug 
repurposing and elucidation of drug mechanisms of action. While single-targeted 
drugs have demonstrated clinical success, they often exhibit limited efficacy 
against complex diseases, such as cancers, whose development and treatment is 
dependent on several biological processes. Therefore, a comprehensive 
understanding of primary, secondary and even inactive targets becomes essential 
in the quest for effective and safe treatments for cancer and other indications. 
The human proteome offers over a thousand druggable targets, yet most 
FDA-approved drugs bind to only a small fraction of these targets.
RESULTS: This study introduces an attention-based method (called as MMAtt-DTA) 
to predict drug-target bioactivities across human proteins within seven 
superfamilies. We meticulously examined nine different descriptor sets to 
identify optimal signature descriptors for predicting novel DTIs. Our testing 
results demonstrated Spearman correlations exceeding 0.72 (P < 0.001) for six 
out of seven superfamilies. The proposed method outperformed fourteen 
state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning and graph-based methods and 
maintained relatively high performance for most target superfamilies when tested 
with independent bioactivity data sources. We computationally validated 185 676 
drug-target pairs from ChEMBL-V33 that were not available during model training, 
achieving a reasonable performance with Spearman correlation >0.57 (P < 0.001) 
for most superfamilies. This underscores the robustness of the proposed method 
for predicting novel DTIs. Finally, we applied our method to predict missing 
bioactivities among 3492 approved molecules in ChEMBL-V33, offering a valuable 
tool for advancing drug mechanism discovery and repurposing existing drugs for 
new indications.

OBJECTIVE: miR-497/195, located at 17p13.1, is a highly conserved miRNA cluster 
whose abnormal expression is a key regulator of carcinogenesis. We performed a 
comprehensive analysis of the miR-497/195 cluster to determine its prognostic 
utility and role in cervical cancer (CC) using publicly available datasets.
RESULTS: In silico analysis and validation revealed that this cluster is 
downregulated in CC. A total of 60 target genes of miR-497/195 cluster were 
identified as differentially expressed between normal and CC samples. ShinyGO, 
STRING, CytoHubba, Timer 2.0, HPA, and HCMBD were used for functional 
enrichment, PPIN network construction, hub gene identification, immune 
infiltration correlation, histopathological expression, and determination of the 
metastatic potential of miR-497/195 cluster and their target genes. PPIN 
analysis identified CCNE1, CCNE2, ANLN, RACGAP1, KIF23, CHEK1, CDC25A, E2F7, 
CDK1, and CEP55 as the top 10 hub genes (HGs). Furthermore, the upregulation of 
RECK, ATD5, and BCL2, downregulation of OSBPL3, RCAN3, and HIST1H3H effected 
overall survival of CC patients. We identified 6 targets (TFAP2A, CLSPN, RASEF, 
HIST1H3H, AKT3, and ITPR1) of miR-497/195 cluster to influence metastasis. In 
addition, 8 druggable genes and 38 potential drugs were also identified. Our 
study identified miR-497/195 cluster target genes and pathways that could be 
used for prognostic and therapeutic applications in CC.

BACKGROUND: Advanced skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is responsible for the 
majority of skin cancer-related deaths. Apart from the rare BRAF V600F mutation, 
which can be targeted with specific drugs, there are currently no other novel 
effective therapeutic targets.
METHODS: We used SMR analysis with cis-expressed quantitative trait locus 
(cis-eQTL) as the exposure variable and SKCM as the outcome variable to identify 
potential therapeutic targets for SKCM. Colocalization assays and HEIDI tests 
are used to test whether SKCM risk and gene expression are driven by common 
SNPs. Replication analysis further validated the findings, and we also 
constructed protein-protein interaction networks to explore the relationship 
between the identified genes and known SKCM targets. Drug prediction and 
molecular docking further validated the medicinal value of drug targets. 
Transcriptome differential analysis further validated that there were 
differences between normal tissues and SKCM for the selected targets.
RESULTS: We identified 13 genes significantly associated with the risk of SKCM, 
including five protective genes and eight harmful genes. The HEIDI test and 
co-localization analysis further indicates a causal association between genes 
(SOX4, MAFF) and SKCM, categorized as Class 1 evidence targets. The remaining 11 
genes, except for HELZ2 show a moderately causal association with SKCM, 
categorized as Class 2 evidence targets. Target druggability predictions from 
DGIdb suggest that SOX4, MAFF, ACSF3, CDK10, SPG7, and TCF25 are likely to be 
future drug targets.
CONCLUSION: The study provides genetic evidence for targeting available drug 
genes for the treatment of SKCM.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify potential drug targets for 
myopia and explore underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: Mendelian randomization (MR) was implemented to assess the effect of 
2684 pharmacologically targetable genes in the blood and retina on the risk of 
myopia from a genomewide association study (GWAS) for age-at-onset of spectacle 
wearing-inferred mean spherical equivalent (MSE; discovery cohort, N = 287,448, 
European), which was further validated in a GWAS for autorefraction-measured MSE 
(replication cohort, N = 95,619, European). The reliability of the identified 
significant potential targets was strengthened by colocalization analysis. 
Additionally, enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network, and 
molecular docking were performed to explore the functional roles and the 
druggability of these targets.
RESULTS: This systematic drug target identification has unveiled 6 putative 
genetically causal targets for myopia-CD34, CD55, Wnt3, LCAT, BTN3A1, and 
TSSK6-each backed by colocalization evidence in adult blood eQTL datasets. 
Functional analysis found that dopaminergic neuron differentiation, cell 
adhesion, Wnt signaling pathway, and plasma lipoprotein-associated pathways may 
be involved in myopia pathogenesis. Finally, drug prediction and molecular 
docking corroborated the pharmacological value of these targets with LCAT 
demonstrating the strongest binding affinity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study not only opens new avenues for the development of 
therapeutic interventions for myopia but may also help to understand the 
underlying mechanisms of myopia.

BACKGROUND: There are no effective pharmacological treatments for sarcopenia. We 
aim to identify potential therapeutic targets for sarcopenia by integrating 
various publicly available datasets.
METHODS: We integrated druggable genome data, cis-eQTL/cis-pQTL from human blood 
and skeletal muscle tissue, and GWAS summary data of sarcopenia-related traits 
to analyse the potential causal relationships between drug target genes and 
sarcopenia using the Mendelian Randomization (MR) method. Sensitivity analyses 
and Bayesian colocalization were employed to validate the causal relationships. 
We also assessed the side effects or additional indications of the identified 
drug targets using a phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR) approach and investigated 
actionable drugs for target genes using available databases.
RESULTS: MR analysis identified 17 druggable genes with potential causation to 
sarcopenia in human blood or skeletal muscle tissue. Six of them (HP, HLA-DRA, 
MAP 3K3, MFGE8, COL15A1, and AURKA) were further confirmed by Bayesian 
colocalization (PPH4 > 90%). The up-regulation of HP [higher ALM (beta: 0.012, 
95% CI: 0.007-0.018, P = 1.2*10-5) and higher grip strength (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 
0.94-0.98, P = 4.2*10-5)], MAP 3K3 [higher ALM (beta: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.21-0.26, 
P = 1.8*10-94), higher grip strength (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.75-0.90, 
P = 2.1*10-5), and faster walking pace (beta: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.02-0.05, 
P = 8.5*10-6)], and MFGE8 [higher ALM (muscle eQTL, beta: 0.09, 95% CI: 
0.06-0.11, P = 6.1*10-13; blood pQTL, beta: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.03-0.07, 
P = 3.8*10-09)], as well as the down-regulation of HLA-DRA [lower ALM (beta: 
-0.09, 95% CI: -0.11 to -0.08, P = 5.4*10-36) and lower grip strength (OR: 1.13, 
95% CI: 1.07-1.20, P = 1.8*10-5)] and COL15A1 [higher ALM (muscle eQTL, beta: 
-0.07, 95% CI: -0.10 to -0.04, P = 3.4*10-07; blood pQTL, beta: -0.05, 95% CI: 
-0.06 to -0.03, P = 1.6*10-07)], decreased the risk of sarcopenia. AURKA in 
blood (beta: -0.16, 95% CI: -0.22 to -0.09, P = 2.1*10-06) and skeletal muscle 
(beta: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.05, P = 5.3*10-05) tissues showed an inverse 
relationship with sarcopenia risk. The Phe-MR indicated that the six potential 
therapeutic targets for sarcopenia had no significant adverse effects. Drug 
repurposing analysis supported zinc supplementation and collagenase clostridium 
histolyticum might be potential therapeutics for sarcopenia by activating HP and 
inhibiting COL15A1, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research indicated MAP 3K3, MFGE8, COL15A1, HP, and HLA-DRA may 
serve as promising targets for sarcopenia, while the effectiveness of zinc 
supplementation and collagenase clostridium histolyticum for sarcopenia requires 
further validation.

BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB) is a malignant tumor primarily found in children, 
presenting significant challenges in its development and prognosis. The role of 
necroptosis in the pathogenesis of NB has been acknowledged as crucial for 
treatment. This study aimed to investigate the key genes and functional pathways 
associated with necroptosis, as well as immune infiltration analysis, in NB. 
Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic significance of these genes for 
prognostic assessment and explore their potential immunological characteristics.
METHODS: The NB dataset (GSE19274, GSE73517, and GSE85047) was obtained from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and genes associated with necroptosis 
were collected from GeneCards and previous literature. First, we conducted 
differential expression analysis and performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). We employed gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA) to identify overlapping enriched functional pathways from the NB 
dataset. In addition, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network, predicting relevant microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs), 
as well as their corresponding drug predictions. Furthermore, the diagnostic 
value was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. 
Finally, an immune infiltration analysis was performed.
RESULTS: We identified six necroptosis-related differentially expressed genes 
(NRDEGs) closely associated with necroptosis in NB. They were enriched in 
Tuberculosis, Apoptosis-multiple species, Salmonella infection, legionellosis, 
and platinum drug resistance. GSEA and PPI network analyses, along with 
mRNA-drug interaction network, revealed 38 potential drugs corresponding to 
BIRC2, CAMK2G, CASP3, and IL8. ROC curve analysis showed that in GSE19274, FLOT2 
with area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.850 and DAPK1 with AUC of 0.789.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study elucidates the key genes and functional pathways 
associated with necroptosis in NB, offering valuable insights to enhance our 
comprehension of the pathogenesis of NB, and improve prognosis assessment.

Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and lung cancer, 
known for its highly metastatic progression, remains among the most lethal of 
malignancies. Lung cancer metastasis can selectively spread to multiple 
different organs, however the genetic and molecular drivers for this process are 
still poorly understood. Understanding the heterogeneous genomic profile of lung 
cancer metastases is considered key in identifying therapeutic targets that 
prevent its spread. Research has identified the key source for metastasis being 
clusters of cells rather than individual cancer cells. These clusters, known as 
metastatic cancer cell clusters (MCCCs) have been shown to be 100-fold more 
tumorigenic than individual cancer cells. Unfortunately, access to these primary 
drivers of metastases remains difficult and has limited our understanding of 
their molecular and genomic profiles. Strong evidence in the literature suggests 
that differentially regulated biological pathways in MCCCs can provide new 
therapeutic drug targets to help combat cancer metastases. In order to expand 
research into MCCCs and their role in metastasis, we demonstrate a novel, proof 
of principle technology, to capture MCCCs directly from patients' whole blood. 
Our platform can be readily tuned for different solid tumor types by combining a 
biomimicry-based margination effect coupled with immunoaffinity to isolate 
MCCCs. Adopting a selective capture approach based on overexpressed CD44 in 
MCCCs provides a methodology that preferentially isolates them from whole blood. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate a high capture efficiency of more than 90% when 
spiking MCCC-like model cell clusters into whole blood. Characterization of the 
captured MCCCs from lung cancer patients by immunofluorescence staining and 
genomic analyses, suggests highly differential morphologies and genomic 
profiles. This study lays the foundation to identify potential drug targets thus 
unlocking a new area of anti-metastatic therapeutics.

At the beginning of the "Disease X" outbreak, drug discovery and development are 
often challenged by insufficient and unbalanced data. To address this problem 
and maximize the information value of limited data, we propose a drug screening 
model, LGCNN, based on convolutional neural network (CNN), which enables rapid 
drug screening by integrating features of drug molecular structures and 
drug-target interactions at both local and global (LG) levels. Experimental 
results show that LGCNN exhibits better performance compared to other 
state-of-the-art classification methods under limited data. In addition, LGCNN 
was applied to anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug screening to realize therapeutic drug mining 
against COVID-19. LGCNN transcends the limitations of traditional models for 
predicting interactions between single drug targets and shows new advantages in 
predicting multi-target drug-target interactions. Notably, the cross-coronavirus 
generalizability of the model is also implied by the analysis of targets, drugs, 
and mechanisms in the prediction results. In conclusion, LGCNN provides new 
ideas and methods for rapid drug screening in emergency situations where data 
are scarce.

PURPOSE: Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is a prevalent autoimmune disease. The 
immune dysregulation it causes often leads to the development of diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in clinical practice. However, how it contributes to 
these two disorders at the molecular level is not yet known. This study explored 
the potential molecular mechanisms associated with the differences between DLBCL 
and pSS.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gene expression matrices from discovery cohort 1, 
discovery cohort 2, and the validation cohort were downloaded from the GEO and 
TCGA databases. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was 
performed to identify the coexpression modules of DLBCL and pSS in discovery 
cohort 1 and obtain shared genes. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses and PPI 
network analysis were performed on the shared genes. Immune-related genes (IRGs) 
were intersected with shared genes to obtain common genes. Afterward, common 
genes were identified via machine learning methods. The immune infiltration 
analysis, miRNA-TF-hub gene regulatory chart, gene interactions of the hub 
genes, and gene‒drug target analysis were performed. Finally, STAT1 was 
identified as a possible essential gene by the above analysis, and immune 
infiltration and GSEA pathway analyses were performed in the high- and 
low-expression groups in discovery cohort 2. The diagnostic efficacy of the hub 
genes was assessed in the validation cohort, and clinical samples were collected 
for validation.
RESULTS: By WGCNA, one modular gene in each group was considered highly 
associated with the disease, and we obtained 28 shared genes. Enrichment 
analysis revealed shared genes involved in the viral response and regulation. We 
obtained four hub genes (ISG20, STAT1, TLR7, and RSAD2) via the algorithm. Hub 
genes and similar genes are primarily involved in regulating type I IFNs. The 
construction of a miRNA-TF-hub gene regulatory chart revealed that 
hsa-mir-155-5p, hsa-mir-146b-5p, hsa-mir-21-3p, and hsa-mir-126-3p play 
essential roles in both diseases. Hub genes were differentially expressed in 
B-cell memory according to immune infiltration analysis. Hub genes had a strong 
diagnostic effect on both diseases. STAT1 plays an essential role in immune 
cells in both diseases.
CONCLUSION: We identified hub susceptibility genes for DLBCL and pSS and 
identified hub genes and potential therapeutic targets that may act as 
biomarkers.

Somatoform traits, which manifest as persistent physical symptoms without a 
clear medical cause, are prevalent and pose challenges to clinical practice. 
Understanding the genetic basis of these disorders could improve diagnostic and 
therapeutic approaches. With publicly available summary statistics, we conducted 
a multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) and multi-omic analysis of 
four somatoform traits-fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, pain intensity, and 
health satisfaction-in 799,429 individuals genetically similar to Europeans. 
Using genomic structural equation modeling, GWAS identified 134 loci 
significantly associated with a somatoform common factor, including 44 loci not 
significant in the input GWAS and 8 novel loci for somatoform traits. 
Gene-property analyses highlighted an enrichment of genes involved in synaptic 
transmission and enriched gene expression in 12 brain tissues. Six genes, 
including members of the CD300 family, had putatively causal effects mediated by 
protein abundance. There was substantial polygenic overlap (76-83%) between the 
somatoform and externalizing, internalizing, and general psychopathology 
factors. Somatoform polygenic scores were associated most strongly with obesity, 
Type 2 diabetes, tobacco use disorder, and mood/anxiety disorders in independent 
biobanks. Drug repurposing analyses suggested potential therapeutic targets, 
including MEK inhibitors. Mendelian randomization indicated potentially 
protective effects of gut microbiota, including Ruminococcus bromii. These 
biological insights provide promising avenues for treatment development.

BACKGROUND: Endometriosis (EMs) is an enigmatic disease of yet-unknown 
pathogenesis. Disulfidptosis, a novel identified form of programmed cell death 
resulting from disulfide stress, stands a chance of treating diverse ailments. 
However, the potential roles of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in EMs 
remain elusive. This study aims to thoroughly explore the key disulfidptosis 
genes involved in EMs, and probe novel diagnostic markers and candidate 
therapeutic compounds from the aspect of disulfidptosis based on bioinformatics 
analysis, machine learning, and animal experiments.
RESULTS: Enrichment analysis on key module genes and differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) of eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues in EMs suggested that 
EMs was closely related to disulfidptosis. And then, we obtained 20 and 16 
disulfidptosis-related DEGs in eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue, 
respectively. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed complex 
interactions between genes, and screened nine and ten hub genes in eutopic and 
ectopic endometrial tissue, respectively. Furthermore, immune infiltration 
analysis uncovered distinct differences in the immunocyte, human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) gene set, and immune checkpoints in the eutopic and ectopic 
endometrial tissues when compared with health control. Besides, the hub genes 
mentioned above showed a close correlation with the immune microenvironment of 
EMs. Furthermore, four machine learning algorithms were applied to screen 
signature genes in eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue, including the binary 
logistic regression (BLR), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO), the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and 
the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Model training and hyperparameter 
tuning were implemented on 80% of the data using a ten-fold cross-validation 
method, and tested in the testing sets which determined the excellent diagnostic 
performance of these models by six indicators (Sensitivity, Specificity, 
Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Accuracy, and Area Under 
Curve). And seven eutopic signature genes (ACTB, GYS1, IQGAP1, MYH10, NUBPL, 
SLC7A11, TLN1) and five ectopic signature genes (CAPZB, CD2AP, MYH10, OXSM, 
PDLIM1) were finally identified based on machine learning. The independent 
validation dataset also showed high accuracy of the signature genes (IQGAP1, 
SLC7A11, CD2AP, MYH10, PDLIM1) in predicting EMs. Moreover, we screened 12 
specific compounds for EMs based on ectopic signature genes and the 
pharmacological impact of tretinoin on signature genes was further verified in 
the ectopic lesion in the EMs murine model.
CONCLUSION: This study verified a close association between disulfidptosis and 
EMs based on bioinformatics analysis, machine learning, and animal experiments. 
Further investigation on the biological mechanism of disulfidptosis in EMs is 
anticipated to yield novel advancements for searching for potential diagnostic 
biomarkers and revolutionary therapeutic approaches in EMs.

Our research aimed to identify new therapeutic targets for Lung adenocarcinoma 
(LUAD), a major subtype of non-small cell lung cancer known for its low 5-year 
survival rate of 22%. By employing a comprehensive methodological approach, we 
analyzed bulk RNA sequencing data from 513 LUAD and 59 non-tumorous tissues, 
identifying 2,688 differentially expressed genes. Using Mendelian randomization 
(MR), we identified 74 genes with strong evidence for a causal effect on risk of 
LUAD. Survival analysis on these genes revealed significant differences in 
survival rates for 13 of them. Our pathway enrichment analysis highlighted their 
roles in immune response and cell communication, deepening our understanding. We 
also utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to uncover cell 
type-specific gene expression patterns within LUAD, emphasizing the tumor 
microenvironment's heterogeneity. Pseudotime analysis further assisted in 
assessing the heterogeneity of tumor cell populations. Additionally, 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted to evaluate the 
potential druggability of these identified genes. The culmination of our efforts 
led to the identification of five genes (tier 1) with the most compelling 
evidence, including SECISBP2L, PRCD, SMAD9, C2orf91, and HSD17B13, and eight 
genes (tier 2) with convincing evidence for their potential as therapeutic 
targets.

Although both short and long sleep duration are associated with elevated 
hypertension risk, our understanding of their interplay with biological pathways 
governing blood pressure remains limited. To address this, we carried out 
genome-wide cross-population gene-by-short-sleep and long-sleep duration 
interaction analyses for three blood pressure traits (systolic, diastolic, and 
pulse pressure) in 811,405 individuals from diverse population groups. We 
discover 22 novel gene-sleep duration interaction loci for blood pressure, 
mapped to 23 genes. Investigating these genes' functional implications shed 
light on neurological, thyroidal, bone metabolism, and hematopoietic pathways 
that necessitate future investigation for blood pressure management that caters 
to sleep health lifestyle. Non-overlap between short sleep (12) and long sleep 
(10) interactions underscores the plausible nature of distinct influences of 
both sleep duration extremes in cardiovascular health. Several of our loci are 
specific towards a particular population background or sex, emphasizing the 
importance of addressing heterogeneity entangled in gene-environment 
interactions, when considering precision medicine design approaches for blood 
pressure management.

Genetic risks for substance use disorders (SUDs) are due to both SUD-specific 
and SUD-shared genes. We performed the largest multivariate analyses to date to 
search for SUD-shared genes using samples of European (EA), African (AA), and 
Latino (LA) ancestries. By focusing on variants having cross-SUD and 
cross-ancestry concordant effects, we identified 45 loci. Through gene-based 
analyses, gene mapping, and gene prioritization, we identified 250 SUD-shared 
genes. These genes are highly expressed in amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, 
hypothalamus, and thalamus, primarily in neuronal cells. Cross-SUD concordant 
variants explained ~ 50% of the heritability of each SUD in EA. The top 5% 
individuals having the highest polygenic scores were approximately twice as 
likely to have SUDs as others in EA and LA. Polygenic scores had higher 
predictability in females than in males in EA. Using real-world data, we 
identified five drugs targeting identified SUD-shared genes that may be 
repurposed to treat SUDs.

Combining multiple drugs broadens the window of therapeutic opportunities and is 
crucial for diseases that are currently lacking fully curative treatments. A 
powerful emerging tool for selecting effective drugs and combinations is the 
high-throughput drug screening (HTP). The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) 
givinostat (ITF2357) has been shown to act effectively against CRLF2-rearranged 
pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), a subtype 
characterized by poor outcome and enriched in children with Down Syndrome, very 
fragile patients with a high susceptibility to treatment-related toxicity. The 
aim of this study is to investigate possible synergies with givinostat for these 
difficult-to-treat patients by performing HTP screening with a library of 174 
drugs, either approved or in preclinical studies. By applying this approach to 
the CRLF2-r MHH-CALL-4 cell line, we identified 19 compounds with higher 
sensitivity in combination with givinostat compared to the single treatments. 
Next, the synergy between givinostat and the promising candidates was further 
validated in CRLF2r cell lines with a broad matrix of concentrations. The 
combinations with trametinib (MEKi) or venetoclax (BCL2i) were found to be the 
most effective and with the greatest synergy across three metrics (ZIP, HAS, 
Bliss). Their efficacy was confirmed in primary blasts treated ex vivo at 
concentration ranges with a safe profile on healthy cells. Finally, we described 
givinostat-induced modifications in gene expression of MAPK and BCL-2 family 
members, supporting the observed synergistic interactions. Overall, our study 
represents a model of drug repurposing strategy using HTP screening for 
identifying synergistic, efficient, and safe drug combinations.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease that includes Crohn's 
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although genome-wide association 
studies (GWASs) have identified many relevant genetic risk loci, the impact of 
these loci on protein abundance and their potential utility as clinical 
therapeutic targets remain uncertain. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate 
the pathogenesis of IBD and identify effective therapeutic targets through a 
comprehensive and integrated analysis. We systematically integrated GWAS data 
related to IBD, UC and CD (N = 25,305) by the study of de Lange KM with the 
human blood proteome (N = 7213) by the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
(ARIC) study. Proteome-wide association study (PWAS), mendelian randomisation 
(MR) and Bayesian colocalisation analysis were used to identify proteins 
contributing to the risk of IBD. Integrative analysis revealed that genetic 
variations in IBD, UC and CD affected the abundance of five (ERAP2, RIPK2, 
TALDO1, CADM2 and RHOC), three (VSIR, HGFAC and CADM2) and two (MST1 and FLRT3) 
cis-regulated plasma proteins, respectively (P < 0.05). Among the proteins 
identified via Bayesian colocalisation analysis, CADM2 was found to be an 
important common protein between IBD and UC. A drug and five druggable target 
genes were identified from DGIdb after Bayesian colocalisation analysis. Our 
study's findings from genetic and proteomic approaches have identified 
compelling proteins that may serve as important leads for future functional 
studies and potential drug targets for IBD (UC and CD).

OBJECTIVE: Ferroptosis and necroptosis are two recently identified forms of 
non-apoptotic cell death. Their dysregulation plays a critical role in the 
development and progression of Psoriasis (PsD) and Atherosclerosis (AS). This 
study explores shared Ferroptosis and necroptosis-related genes and elucidates 
their molecular mechanisms in PsD and AS through the analysis of public 
databases.
METHODS: Data sets for PsD (GSE30999) and AS (GSE28829) were retrieved from the 
GEO database. Differential gene expression (DEG) and weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA) were performed. Machine learning algorithms identified 
candidate biomarkers, whose diagnostic values were assessed using Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Additionally, the expression 
levels of these biomarkers in cell models of AS and PsD were quantitatively 
measured using Western Blot (WB) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). 
Furthermore, CIBERSORT evaluated immune cell infiltration in PsD and AS tissues, 
highlighting the correlation between characteristic genes and immune cells. 
Predictive analysis for candidate drugs targeting characteristic genes was 
conducted using the DGIdb database, and an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network related to 
these genes was constructed.
RESULTS: We identified 44 differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes 
(DE-FRGs) and 30 differentially expressed necroptosis-related genes (DE-NRGs). 
GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed significant enrichment of these genes 
in immune-related and inflammatory pathways, especially in NOD-like receptor and 
TNF signaling pathways. Two ferroptosis-related genes (NAMPT, ZFP36) and eight 
necroptosis-related genes (C7, CARD6, CASP1, CTSD, HMOX1, NOD2, PYCARD, 
TNFRSF21) showed high sensitivity and specificity in ROC curve analysis. These 
findings were corroborated in external validation datasets and cell models. 
Immune infiltration analysis revealed increased levels of T cells gamma delta, 
Macrophages M0, and Macrophages M2 in PsD and AS samples. Additionally, we 
identified 43 drugs targeting 5 characteristic genes. Notably, the 
XIST-miR-93-5p-ZFP36/HMOX1 and NEAT1-miR-93-5p-ZFP36/HMOX1 pathways have been 
identified as promising RNA regulatory pathways in AS and PsD.
CONCLUSION: The two ferroptosis-related genes (NAMPT, ZFP36) and eight 
necroptosis-related genes (C7, CARD6, CASP1, CTSD, HMOX1, NOD2, PYCARD, 
TNFRSF21) are potential key biomarkers for PsD and AS. These genes significantly 
influence the pathogenesis of PsD and AS by modulating macrophage activity, 
participating in immune regulation, and mediating inflammatory responses.

Head and neck cancer ranks as the sixth-most common malignancy worldwide, 
characterized by high mortality and recurrence rates. Research studies indicate 
that molecular diagnostics play a crucial role in the early detection and 
prognostic evaluation of these diseases. This study aimed to identify potential 
biomarkers for head and neck cancer and elucidate their interactions with miRNAs 
and possible therapeutic drugs. Four drivers, namely, FN1, IL1A, COL1A1, and 
MMP9, were identified using network biology and machine learning approaches. 
Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) showed that these genes were significantly 
involved in different biological processes and pathways, including coagulation, 
UV-response-down, apoptosis, NOTCH signaling, Wnt-beta catenin, and other signal 
pathways. The diagnostic value of these hub genes was validated using receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The top interactive miRNAs, including 
miR-128-3p, miR-218-5p, miR-214-3p, miR-124-3p, miR-129-2-3p, and miR-1-3p, 
targeted the key genes. Furthermore, the interaction between the key genes and 
drugs was also identified. In summary, the key genes and miRNAs or drugs 
reported in this study might provide valuable information for potential 
biomarkers to increase the prognosis and diagnosis of head and neck cancer.

Patients with hemorrhagic stroke have high rates of morbidity and mortality, and 
drugs for prevention are very limited. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis can 
increase the success rate of drug development by providing genetic evidence. 
Previous MR analyses only analyzed the role of individual drug target genes in 
hemorrhagic stroke; therefore, we used MR analysis to systematically explore the 
druggable genes for hemorrhagic stroke. We sequentially performed 
summary-data-based MR analysis and two-sample MR analysis to assess the 
associations of all genes within the database with intracranial aneurysm, 
intracerebral hemorrhage, and their subtypes. Validated genes were further 
analyzed by colocalization. Only genes that were positive in all three analyses 
and were druggable were considered desirable genes. We also explored the 
mediators of genes affecting hemorrhagic stroke incidence. Finally, the 
associations of druggable genes with other cardiovascular diseases were analyzed 
to assess potential side effects. We identified 56 genes that significantly 
affected hemorrhagic stroke incidence. Moreover, TNFSF12, SLC22A4, SPARC, KL, 
RELT, and ADORA3 were found to be druggable. The inhibition of TNFSF12, SLC22A4, 
and SPARC can reduce the risk of intracranial aneurysm, subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
and intracerebral hemorrhage. Gene-induced hypertension may be a potential 
mechanism by which these genes cause hemorrhagic stroke. We also found that 
blocking these genes may cause side effects, such as ischemic stroke and its 
subtypes. Our study revealed that six druggable genes were associated with 
hemorrhagic stroke, and the inhibition of TNFSF12, SLC22A4, and SPARC had 
preventive effects against hemorrhagic strokes.

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) 
may contribute to an increased risk of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). 
However, the exact relationship between HT and PTC is still not fully 
understood. The objective of this study was to identify potential common 
biomarkers that may be associated with both PTC and HT. Three microarray 
datasets from the GEO database and RNA-seq dataset from TCGA database were 
collected to identify shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HT 
and PTC. A total of 101 genes was identified as common DEGs, primarily enriched 
inflammation- and immune-related pathways through GO and KEGG analysis. We 
performed protein-protein interaction analysis and identified six significant 
modules comprising a total of 29 genes. Subsequently, tree hub genes (CD53, 
FCER1G, TYROBP) were selected using random forest (RF) algorithms for the 
development of three diagnostic models. The artificial neural network (ANN) 
model demonstrates superior performance. Notably, CD53 exerted the greatest 
influence on the ANN model output. We analyzed the protein expressions of the 
three genes using the Human Protein Atlas database. Moreover, we observed 
various dysregulated immune cells that were significantly associated with the 
hub genes through immune infiltration analysis. Immunofluorescence staining 
confirmed the differential expression of CD53, FCER1G, and TYROBP, as well as 
the results of immune infiltration analysis. Lastly, we hypothesise that 
benzylpenicilloyl polylysine and aspirinmay be effective in the treatment of HT 
and PTC and may prevent HT carcinogenesis. This study indicates that CD53, 
FCER1G, and TYROBP play a role in the development of HT and PTC, and may 
contribute to the progression of HT to PTC. These hub genes could potentially 
serve as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for PTC and HT.

BACKGROUND: Endometriosis (EM) is a chronic painful condition that predominantly 
affects women of reproductive age. Currently, surgery or medication can only 
provide limited symptom relief. This study used a comprehensive genetic 
analytical approach to explore potential drug targets for EM in the plasma 
proteome.
METHODS: In this study, 2,923 plasma proteins were selected as exposure and EM 
as outcome for two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. The plasma 
proteomic data were derived from the UK Biobank Pharmaceutical Proteomics 
Project (UKB-PPP), while the EM dataset from the FinnGen consortium R10 release 
data. Several sensitivity analyses were performed, including summary-data-based 
MR (SMR) analyses, heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test, reverse 
MR analyses, steiger detection test, and bayesian co-localization analyses. 
Furthermore, proteome-wide association study (PWAS) and single-cell 
transcriptomic analyses were also conducted to validate the findings.
RESULTS: Six significant (p < 3.06 × 10-5) plasma protein-EM pairs were 
identified by MR analyses. These included EPHB4 (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.20 - 
1.63), FSHB (OR = 3.91, 95% CI: 3.13 - 4.87), RSPO3 (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.38 - 
1.86), SEZ6L2 (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.23 - 1.68) and WASHC3 (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 
1.54 - 2.59) were identified as risk factors, whereas KDR (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 
0.75 - 0.90) was found to be a protective factor. All six plasma proteins passed 
the SMR test (P < 8.33 × 10-3), but only four plasma proteins passed the HEIDI 
heterogeneity test (PHEIDI > 0.05), namely FSHB, RSPO3, SEZ6L2 and EPHB4. These 
four proteins showed strong evidence of co-localization (PPH4 > 0.7). In 
particular, RSPO3 and EPHB4 were replicated in the validated PWAS. Single-cell 
analyses revealed high expression of SEZ6L2 and EPHB4 in stromal and epithelial 
cells within EM lesions, while RSPO3 exhibited elevated expression in stromal 
cells and fibroblasts.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified FSHB, RSPO3, SEZ6L2, and EPHB4 as potential 
drug targets for EM and highlighted the critical role of stromal and epithelial 
cells in disease development. These findings provide new insights into the 
diagnosis and treatment of EM.

The major anxiety disorders (ANX; including generalized anxiety disorder, panic 
disorder, and phobias) are highly prevalent, often onset early, persist 
throughout life, and cause substantial global disability. Although distinct in 
their clinical presentations, they likely represent differential expressions of 
a dysregulated threat-response system. Here we present a genome-wide association 
meta-analysis comprising 122,341 European ancestry ANX cases and 729,881 
controls. We identified 58 independent genome-wide significant ANX risk variants 
and 66 genes with robust biological support. In an independent sample of 
1,175,012 self-report ANX cases and 1,956,379 controls, 51 of the 58 associated 
variants were replicated. As predicted by twin studies, we found substantial 
genetic correlation between ANX and depression, neuroticism, and other 
internalizing phenotypes. Follow-up analyses demonstrated enrichment in all 
major brain regions and highlighted GABAergic signaling as one potential 
mechanism underlying ANX genetic risk. These results advance our understanding 
of the genetic architecture of ANX and prioritize genes for functional follow-up 
studies.

PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma has become one of the severe diseases 
threatening human health. T cell exhaustion is deemed as a reason for 
immunotherapy resistance. However, little is known about the roles of CD8 
Tex-related lncRNAs in HCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We processed single-cell RNA sequencing to identify CD8 
Tex-related genes. CD8 Tex-related lncRNAs were identified based on their 
correlations with mRNAs. Unsupervised clustering approach was used to identify 
molecular clusters of CD8 Tex-related lncRNAs. Differences in prognosis and 
immune infiltration between the clusters were explored. Machine learning 
algorithms were used to construct a prognostic signature. Samples were 
classified as low- and high-risk groups based on their risk scores. We 
identified prognosis-related lncRNAs and constructed a ceRNA network. In vitro 
experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts of CD8 Tex-related lncRNAs 
on proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cells.
RESULTS: We clarified cell types within two HCC single-cell datasets. We 
identified specific markers of CD8 Tex cells and analyzed their potential 
functions. Twenty-eight lncRNAs were identified as CD8 Tex-related. Based on CD8 
Tex-related lncRNAs, samples were categorized into two distinct clusters, which 
exhibited significant differences in survival rates and immune infiltration. 
Ninety-six algorithm combinations were employed to establish a prognostic 
signature. RSF emerged as the one with the highest C-index. Patients in high- 
and low-risk groups exhibited marked differences in prognosis, enriched 
pathways, mutations and drug sensitivities. MCM3AP-AS1, MAPKAPK5-AS1 and PART1 
were regarded as prognosis-related lncRNAs. A ceRNA network was constructed 
based on CD8 Tex-related lncRNAs and mRNAs. Experiments on cell lines and 
organoids indicated that downregulation of MCM3AP-AS1, MAPKAPK5-AS1 and PART1 
suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: CD8 Tex-related lncRNAs played crucial roles in HCC progression. Our 
findings provided new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of CD8 Tex-related 
lncRNAs in HCC.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm has a high heritability and often co-occurs with other 
cardiometabolic disorders, suggesting shared genetic susceptibility. We 
investigate this commonality leveraging recent GWAS studies of abdominal aortic 
aneurysm and 32 cardiometabolic traits. We find significant genetic correlations 
between abdominal aortic aneurysm and 21 of the cardiometabolic traits 
investigated, including causal relationships with coronary artery disease, 
hypertension, lipid traits, and blood pressure. For each trait pair, we identify 
shared causal variants, genes, and pathways, revealing that cholesterol 
metabolism and inflammation are shared most prominently. Additionally, we show 
the tissue and cell type specificity in the shared signals, with strong 
enrichment across traits in the liver, arteries, adipose tissues, macrophages, 
adipocytes, and fibroblasts. Finally, we leverage drug-gene databases to 
identify several lipid-lowering drugs and antioxidants with high potential to 
treat abdominal aortic aneurysm with comorbidities. Our study provides insight 
into the shared genetic mechanism between abdominal aortic aneurysm and 
cardiometabolic traits, and identifies potential targets for pharmacological 
intervention.

Psoriasis is an autoimmune cutaneous condition that significantly impacts 
quality of life and represents a burden on society due to its prevalence. 
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have pinpointed several 
psoriasis-related risk loci, underlining the disease's complexity. Functional 
genomics is paramount to unveiling the role of such loci in psoriasis and 
disentangling its complex nature. In this review, we aim to elucidate the main 
findings in this field and integrate our discussion with gold-standard 
techniques in molecular biology-i.e., Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short 
Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-and high-throughput technologies. These tools are 
vital to understanding how disease risk loci affect gene expression in 
psoriasis, which is crucial in identifying new targets for personalized 
treatments in advanced precision medicine.

Diabetes involves the death or dysfunction of pancreatic β-cells. Analysis of 
bulk sequencing from human samples and studies using in vitro and in vivo models 
suggest that endoplasmic reticulum and inflammatory signaling play an important 
role in diabetes progression. To better characterize cell type-specific stress 
response, we perform multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing to define the 
transcriptional signature of primary human islet cells exposed to endoplasmic 
reticulum and inflammatory stress. Through comprehensive pair-wise analysis of 
stress responses across pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cell types, we define 
changes in gene expression for each cell type under different 
diabetes-associated stressors. We find that β-, α-, and ductal cells have the 
greatest transcriptional response. We utilize stem cell-derived islets to study 
islet health through the candidate gene CIB1, which was upregulated under stress 
in primary human islets. Our findings provide insights into cell type-specific 
responses to diabetes-associated stress and establish a resource to identify 
targets for diabetes therapeutics.

OBJECTIVE: The study purpose was to explore the causal association between 
pyruvate metabolism and breast cancer (BC), as well as the molecular role of key 
metabolic genes, by using bioinformatics and Mendelian randomization (MR) 
analysis.
METHODS: We retrieved and examined diverse datasets from the GEO database to 
ascertain differentially acting genes (DAGs) in BC via differential expression 
analysis. Following this, we performed functional and pathway enrichment 
analyses to ascertain noteworthy molecular functions and metabolic pathways in 
BC. Employing MR analysis, we established a causal association between pyruvate 
metabolism and the susceptibility to BC. Additionally, utilizing the DGIdb 
database, we identified potential targeted medications that act on genes 
implicated in the pyruvate metabolic pathway and formulated a competing 
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network in BC.
RESULTS: We collected the datasets GSE54002, GSE70947, and GSE22820, and 
identified a total of 1127 DEGs between the BC and NC groups. GO and KEGG 
enrichment analysis showed that the molecular functions of these DEGs mainly 
included mitotic nuclear division, extracellular matrix, signaling receptor 
activator activity, etc. Metabolic pathways were mainly concentrated in PI3K-Akt 
signaling pathway, Cytokine-cytokine receptor binding and Pyruvate, Tyrosine, 
Propanoate and Phenylalanine metabolism, etc. In addition, MR analysis 
demonstrated a causal relationship between pyruvate metabolism and BC risk. 
Finally, we constructed a regulatory network between pathway genes (ADH1B, 
ACSS2, ACACB, ADH1A, ALDH2, and ADH1C) and targeted drugs, as well as a ceRNA 
(lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA) regulatory network for BC, further revealing their 
interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed a causal association between pyruvate 
metabolism and BC risk, found that ADH1B, ACSS2, ACACB, ADH1A, ALDH2, and ADH1C 
takes place an important part in the development of BC in the molecular 
mechanisms related to pyruvate metabolism, and identified some potential 
targeted small molecule drugs.

AIMS: In patients with heart failure (HF), concomitant sinus node dysfunction 
(SND) is an important predictor of mortality, yet its molecular underpinnings 
are poorly understood. Using proteomics, this study aimed to dissect the protein 
and phosphorylation remodelling within the sinus node in an animal model of HF 
with concurrent SND.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We acquired deep sinus node proteomes and phosphoproteomes 
in mice with heart failure and SND and report extensive remodelling. 
Intersecting the measured (phospho)proteome changes with human genomics 
pharmacovigilance data, highlighted downregulated proteins involved in 
electrical activity such as the pacemaker ion channel, Hcn4. We confirmed the 
importance of ion channel downregulation for sinus node physiology using 
computer modelling. Guided by the proteomics data, we hypothesized that an 
inflammatory response may drive the electrophysiological remodeling underlying 
SND in heart failure. In support of this, experimentally induced inflammation 
downregulated Hcn4 and slowed pacemaking in the isolated sinus node. From the 
proteomics data we identified proinflammatory cytokine-like protein galectin-3 
as a potential target to mitigate the effect. Indeed, in vivo suppression of 
galectin-3 in the animal model of heart failure prevented SND.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, we outline the protein and phosphorylation remodeling 
of SND in heart failure, we highlight a role for inflammation in 
electrophysiological remodelling of the sinus node, and we present galectin-3 
signalling as a target to ameliorate SND in heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a pervasive global health issue, and 
currently, there is a scarcity of targeted drug therapies available. This study 
aims to identify potential druggable target genes for AR using Mendelian 
randomization (MR) analysis.
METHODS: MR analysis was conducted to assess the causal effect of expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in the blood on AR. Data on AR were collected 
from 2 datasets: FinnGen(R9) (11,009 cases and 359,149 controls) and UK Biobank 
(25,486 cases and 87,097 controls). Colocalization analysis was utilized to 
assess the common causal genetic variations between the identified drug target 
genes and AR. We also employed available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
data to gauge the impact of druggable genes on AR biomarkers and other allergic 
diseases.
RESULTS: This study employs MR to analyze the relationship between 3410 
druggable genes and AR. After Bonferroni correction, 10 genes were found to be 
significantly associated with AR risk (P < 0.05/3410). Colocalization analysis 
revealed a significant causal relationship between the expression variation of 
CFL1 and EFEMP2 genes and AR, sharing direct causal variants (colocalization 
probability PP.H3 + PP.H4 > 0.8), highlighting their importance as potential 
therapeutic targets for AR. The CFL1 gene showed a causal link with levels of 
thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), eosinophil count, and interleukin-13 
(IL-13) (P = 0.016, 7.45E-16, 0.00091, respectively). EFEMP2 was also causally 
related to eosinophil count, IL-13, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) (P = 0.00012, 
0.00091, 0.032, respectively). PheWAS analysis revealed significant associations 
of CFL1 with asthma, whereas EFEMP2 showed associations with both asthma and 
eczema. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis further unveiled the 
direct interactions of EFEMP2 and CFL1 with proteins related to immune 
regulation and inflammatory responses, with 77.64% of the network consisting of 
direct bindings, indicating their key roles in modulating AR-related immune and 
inflammatory responses. Notably, there was an 8.01% significant correlation 
between immune-related pathways and genes involved in inflammatory responses.
CONCLUSION: These genes present notable associations with AR biomarkers and 
other autoimmune diseases, offering valuable targets for developing new AR 
therapies.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a disturbance of peripheral and central nerve 
conduction that causes disability in sensory and motor function. Currently, 
there is no effective treatment for SCI. Mitophagy plays a vital role in 
mitochondrial quality control during various physiological and pathological 
processes. The study aimed to elucidate the role of mitophagy and identify 
potential mitophagy-related hub genes in SCI pathophysiology. Two datasets 
(GSE15878 and GSE138637) were analyzed. Firstly, the differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were identified and mitophagy-related genes were obtained from 
GeneCards, then the intersection between SCI and mitophagy-related genes was 
determined. Next, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), weighted 
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interaction network 
(PPI network), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and 
cluster analysis to identify and define the hub genes in SCI. Finally, the link 
between hub genes and infiltrating immune cells was investigated and the 
potential transcriptional regulation/small molecular compounds to target hub 
genes were predicted. In total, SKP1 and BAP1 were identified as hub genes of 
mitophagy-related DEGs during SCI development and regulatory T cells 
(Tregs)/resting NK cells/activated mast cells may play an essential role in the 
progression of SCI. LINC00324 and SNHG16 may regulate SKP1 and BAP1, 
respectively, through miRNAs. Eleven and eight transcriptional factors (TFs) 
regulate SKP1 and BAP1, respectively, and six small molecular compounds target 
BAP1. Then, the mRNA expression levels of BAP1 and SKP1 were detected in the 
injured sites of spinal cord of SD rats at 6 h and 72 h after injury using 
RT-qPCR, and found that the level were decreased. Therefore, the pathways of 
mitophagy are downregulated during the pathophysiology of SCI, and SKP1 and BAP1 
could be accessible targets for diagnosing and treating SCI.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified risk loci for suicide 
attempt (SA), but deciphering how they confer risk for SA remains largely 
unknown. This study aims to identify the key proteins and gain insights into SA 
pathogenesis. We integrated data from the brain proteome (N = 376) and blood 
proteome (N = 35,559) and combined it with the largest SA GWAS summary 
statistics to date (N = 518,612). A comprehensive set of methods was employed, 
including Mendelian randomization (MR), Steiger filtering, Bayesian 
colocalization, proteome‑wide association studies (PWAS), transcript-levels, 
cell-type specificity, correlation, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network analysis. Validation was performed using other protein datasets and the 
SA dataset from FinnGen study. We identified ten proteins (GLRX5, GMPPB, 
B3GALTL, FUCA2, TTLL12, ADCK1, MMAA, HIBADH, ACP1, DOC2A) associated with SA in 
brain proteomics. GLRX5, GMPPB, and FUCA2 showed strong colocalization evidence 
and were supported by PWAS and transcript-level analysis, and were predominantly 
expressed in glutamatergic neuronal cells. In blood proteomics, one significant 
protein (PEAR1) and three near-significant proteins (NDE1, EVA1C, B4GALT2) were 
identified, but lacked colocalization evidence. Moreover, despite the limited 
correlation between the same protein in brain and blood, the PPI network 
analysis provided new insights into the interaction between brain and blood in 
SA. Furthermore, GLRX5 was associated with the GSTP1, the target of Clozapine. 
The comprehensive analysis provides strong evidence supporting a causal 
association between three genetically determined brain proteins (GLRX5, GMPPB, 
and FUCA2) with SA. These findings offer valuable insights into SA's underlying 
mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common chronic oral mucosal disease 
with 1.4 % malignant transformation rate, and its etiology especially immune 
pathogenesis remains unclear. This study was aimed at investigating the immune 
cells related molecular underlying the pathophysiology of OLP through 
bioinformatics analysis.
METHODS: The dataset GSE52130 obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database was conducted a comprehensive analysis in this study. The CIBERSORTx 
was used for investigating immune cells infiltration. The gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA) and gene ontology (GO) enrichment were performed for exploring 
the biological functions and gene annotation. The protein-protein interactions 
(PPI) were constructed by STRING database and visualized by Cytoscape software. 
The cytohubba plugin was utilized for screening hub genes. The receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) was performed for evaluating diagnostic value of 
hub genes. The miRNAs, lncRNAs and drugs were respectively predicted by 
NetworkAnalyst, miRTarbase, ENCORI, and DGIdb database.
RESULTS: This study identified 595 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The 
GSEA indicated keratinization, innate immune system and biological oxidation 
were involved in OLP. GO analysis showed extracellular matrix and keratinocyte 
were mainly enriched. And we found the activated memory CD4+ T cells were lowly 
infiltrated in OLP. We identified 101 activated memory CD4+ T-cells-related 
DEGs. Three hub genes (APP, IL1B, TF) were selected. APP and IL1B were 
significantly up-regulated, whereas TF was down-regulated in OLP. The three hub 
genes show high diagnostic value in OLP. Additionally, they were involved in 
MAPK signal, NF-kappaB signal and iron metabolism in OLP. What's more, 
NEAT1/XIST - miR - 15a - 5p/miR - 155-5p - APP/IL1B signal axis was focused in 
competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. In addition, 35 drugs were predicted 
for OLP.
CONCLUSION: Three activated memory CD4+ T-cells-related DEGs were identified by 
integrative analysis. It may provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of OLP 
and suggest potential therapeutic targets for OLP.

BACKGROUND: Due to a lack of early diagnosis methods and effective drugs, 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has an extremely poor prognosis. DNA 
methylation, transcriptome expression and gene copy number variation (CNV) have 
critical relationships with development and progression of various diseases. The 
purpose of the study was to screen reliable early diagnostic biomarkers and 
potential drugs based on integrative multiomics analysis.
METHODS: We used methylation, transcriptome and CNV profiles to build a 
diagnostic model for PDAC. The protein expression of three model-related genes 
were externally validated using PDAC samples. Then, potential therapeutic drugs 
for PDAC were identified by interaction information related to existing drugs 
and genes.
RESULTS: Four significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were selected 
from 589 common DMRs to build a high-performance diagnostic model for PDAC. 
Then, four hub genes, PHF12, FXYD3, PRKCB and ZNF582, were obtained. The 
external validation results showed that PHF12, FXYD3 and PRKCB protein 
expression levels were all upregulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent 
normal tissues (P<0.05). Promising candidate drugs with activity against PDAC 
were screened and repurposed through gene expression analysis of online 
datasets. The five drugs, including topotecan, PD-0325901, panobinostat, 
paclitaxel and 17-AAG, with the highest activity among 27 PDAC cell lines were 
filtered.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the diagnostic model built based on four significant DMRs 
could accurately distinguish tumor and normal tissues. The five drug candidates 
might be repurposed as promising therapeutics for particular PDAC patients.

Resistance to chemotherapy has been a major hurdle that limits therapeutic 
benefits for many types of cancer. Here we systematically identify genetic 
drivers underlying chemoresistance by performing 30 genome-scale CRISPR knockout 
screens for seven chemotherapeutic agents in multiple cancer cells. 
Chemoresistance genes vary between conditions primarily due to distinct genetic 
background and mechanism of action of drugs, manifesting heterogeneous and 
multiplexed routes towards chemoresistance. By focusing on oxaliplatin and 
irinotecan resistance in colorectal cancer, we unravel that evolutionarily 
distinct chemoresistance can share consensus vulnerabilities identified by 26 
second-round CRISPR screens with druggable gene library. We further pinpoint 
PLK4 as a therapeutic target to overcome oxaliplatin resistance in various 
models via genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition, highlighting a 
single-agent strategy to antagonize evolutionarily distinct chemoresistance. Our 
study not only provides resources and insights into the molecular basis of 
chemoresistance, but also proposes potential biomarkers and therapeutic 
strategies against such resistance.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising tools for combating microbial 
resistance. However, their therapeutic potential is hindered by two intrinsic 
drawbacks-low target affinity and poor in vivo stability. Macrocyclization, a 
process that improves the pharmacological properties and bioactivity of 
peptides, can address these limitations. As a result, macrocyclic peptides 
represent attractive drug candidates. Moreover, many drugs are macrocycles that 
originated from natural product scaffolds, suggesting that nature offers 
solutions to the challenges faced by AMPs. In this review, we explore natural 
cyclic peptides from the DBAASP database. DBAASP is a comprehensive repository 
of data on antimicrobial/cytotoxic activities and structures of peptides. We 
analyze the data on small (≤25 AA) ribosomal and non-ribosomal cyclic peptides 
from DBAASP according to their amino acid composition, bonds used for 
cyclization, targets they act on, and mechanisms of action. This analysis will 
enhance our understanding of the small cyclic peptides that nature has provided 
to defend living organisms.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe and progressive biliary obstructive disease in 
infants that requires early diagnosis and new therapeutic targets. This study 
employed bioinformatics methods to identify diagnostic biomarkers and potential 
therapeutic targets for BA. Our analysis of mRNA expression from Gene Expression 
Omnibus datasets revealed 3,273 differentially expressed genes between patients 
with BA and those without BA (nBA). Weighted gene coexpression network analysis 
determined that the turquoise gene coexpression module, consisting of 298 genes, 
is predominantly associated with BA. The machine learning method then filtered 
out the top 2 important genes, CXCL8 and TMSB10, from the turquoise module. The 
area under receiver operating characteristic curves for TMSB10 and CXCL8 were 
0.961 and 0.927 in the training group and 0.819 and 0.791 in the testing group, 
which indicated a high diagnostic value. Besides, combining TMSB10 and CXCL8, a 
nomogram with better diagnostic performance was built for clinical translation. 
Several studies have highlighted the potential of CXCL8 as a therapeutic target 
for BA, while TMSB10 has been shown to regulate cell polarity, which was related 
to BA progression. Our analysis with qRT PCR and immunohistochemistry also 
confirmed the upregulation of TMSB10 at mRNA and protein levels in BA liver 
samples. These findings highlight the sensitivity of CXCL8 and TMSB10 as 
diagnostic biomarkers and their potential as therapeutic targets for BA.

Unleashing antitumor T cell activity by checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy is 
effective in cancer patients, but clinical responses are limited. Cytokine 
signaling through the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (STAT) pathway correlates with checkpoint immunotherapy 
resistance. We report a phase I clinical trial of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib 
with anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab in Hodgkin lymphoma patients relapsed or 
refractory following checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. The combination yielded 
a best overall response rate of 53% (10/19). Ruxolitinib significantly reduced 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and percentages of myeloid suppressor cells but 
increased numbers of cytokine-producing T cells. Ruxolitinib rescued the 
function of exhausted T cells and enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint 
blockade in preclinical solid tumor and lymphoma models. This synergy was 
characterized by a switch from suppressive to immunostimulatory myeloid cells, 
which enhanced T cell division.

Transcriptional cofactors of the ETO family are recurrent fusion partners in 
acute leukemia. We characterized the ETO2 regulome by integrating transcriptomic 
and chromatin binding analyses in human erythroleukemia xenografts and 
controlled ETO2 depletion models. We demonstrate that beyond its 
well-established repressive activity, ETO2 directly activates transcription of 
MYB, among other genes. The ETO2-activated signature is associated with a poorer 
prognosis in erythroleukemia but also in other acute myeloid and lymphoid 
leukemia subtypes. Mechanistically, ETO2 colocalizes with EP300 and MYB at 
enhancers supporting the existence of an ETO2/MYB feedforward transcription 
activation loop (e.g., on MYB itself). Both small-molecule and PROTAC-mediated 
inhibition of EP300 acetyltransferases strongly reduced ETO2 protein, chromatin 
binding, and ETO2-activated transcripts. Taken together, our data show that ETO2 
positively enforces a leukemia maintenance program that is mediated in part by 
the MYB transcription factor and that relies on acetyltransferase cofactors to 
stabilize ETO2 scaffolding activity.

Cells respond divergently to drugs due to the heterogeneity among cell 
populations. Thus, it is crucial to identify drug-responsive cell populations in 
order to accurately elucidate the mechanism of drug action, which is still a 
great challenge. Here, we address this problem with scRank, which employs a 
target-perturbed gene regulatory network to rank drug-responsive cell 
populations via in silico drug perturbations using untreated single-cell 
transcriptomic data. We benchmark scRank on simulated and real datasets, which 
shows the superior performance of scRank over existing methods. When applied to 
medulloblastoma and major depressive disorder datasets, scRank identifies 
drug-responsive cell types that are consistent with the literature. Moreover, 
scRank accurately uncovers the macrophage subpopulation responsive to tanshinone 
IIA and its potential targets in myocardial infarction, with experimental 
validation. In conclusion, scRank enables the inference of drug-responsive cell 
types using untreated single-cell data, thus providing insights into the 
cellular-level impacts of therapeutic interventions.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent globally with limited therapeutic 
drugs available. To systemically identify novel proteins involved in the 
pathogenesis of CKD and possible therapeutic targets, we integrated human plasma 
proteomes with the genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of CKD, estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to perform 
proteome-wide association study (PWAS), Mendelian Randomization and Bayesian 
colocalization analyses. The single-cell RNA sequencing data of healthy human 
and mouse kidneys were analyzed to explore the cell-type specificity of 
identified genes. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to investigate 
the involved signaling pathways. The PWAS identified 22 plasma proteins 
significantly associated with CKD. Of them, the significant associations of 
three proteins (INHBC, LMAN2, and SNUPN) were replicated in the GWASs of eGFR, 
and BUN. Mendelian Randomization analyses showed that INHBC and SNUPN were 
causally associated with CKD, eGFR, and BUN. The Bayesian colocalization 
analysis identified shared causal variants for INHBC in CKD, eGFR, and BUN (all 
PP4 > 0.75). The single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the INHBC gene was 
sparsely scattered within the kidney cells. This proteomic study revealed that 
INHBC, LMAN2, and SNUPN may be involved in the pathogenesis of CKD, which 
represent novel therapeutic targets and warrant further exploration in future 
research.

BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis has been discovered to be a critical factor in 
developing tumors and ischemic diseases. However, the role of 
angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains 
unclear.
METHODS: The GSE66360 dataset was used as the training cohort, and the GSE48060 
dataset was used as the external validation cohort. The random forest (RF) 
algorithm was used to identify the signature genes. Consensus clustering 
analysis was used to identify robust molecular clusters associated with 
angiogenesis. The ssGSEA was used to analyze the correlation between ARGs and 
immune cell infiltration. In addition, we constructed miRNA-gene, transcription 
factor network, and targeted drug network of signature genes. RT-qPCR was used 
to verify the expression levels of signature genes.
RESULTS: Seven signature ARGs were identified based on the RF algorithm. 
Receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed the classification accuracy 
of the risk predictive model based on signature ARGs (area under the curve [AUC] 
= 0.9596 in the training cohort and AUC = 0.7773 in the external validation 
cohort). Subsequently, the ARG clusters were identified by consensus clustering. 
Cluster B had a more generalized high expression of ARGs and was significantly 
associated with immune infiltration. The miRNA and transcription factor network 
provided new ideas for finding potential upstream targets and biomarkers. 
Finally, the results of RT-qPCR were consistent with the bioinformatics 
analysis, further validating our results.
CONCLUSIONS: Angiogenesis is closely related to AMI, and characterizing the 
angiogenic features of patients with AMI can help to risk-stratify patients and 
provide personalized treatment.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify key clock genes closely associated with 
major depressive disorder (MDD) using bioinformatics and machine learning 
approaches.
METHODS: Gene expression data of 128 MDD patients and 64 healthy controls from 
blood samples were obtained. Differentially expressed were identified and 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was first performed to 
screen MDD-related key genes. These genes were then intersected with 1475 known 
circadian rhythm genes to identify circadian rhythm genes associated with MDD. 
Finally, multiple machine learning algorithms were applied for further 
selection, to determine the most critical 4 circadian rhythm biomarkers.
RESULTS: Four key circadian rhythm genes (ABCC2, APP, HK2 and RORA) were 
identified that could effectively distinguish MDD samples from controls. These 
genes were significantly enriched in circadian pathways and showed strong 
correlations with immune cell infiltration. Drug target prediction suggested 
that small molecules like melatonin and escitalopram may target these circadian 
rhythm proteins.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed discovered 4 key circadian rhythm genes closely 
associated with MDD, which may serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets. The findings highlight the important roles of circadian disruptions in 
the pathogenesis of MDD, providing new insights for precision diagnosis and 
targeted treatment of MDD.

BACKGROUND: Aging is recognized as the key risk for intracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH). The detailed mechanisms of aging in ICH warrant exploration. This study 
aimed to identify potential aging-related genes associated with ICH.
METHODS: ICH-specific aging-related genes were determined by the intersection of 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between perihematomal tissues and 
corresponding contralateral parts of four patients with ICH (GSE24265) and 349 
aging-related genes obtained from the Aging Atlas database. Gene Ontology (GO), 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
(GSEA) analyses were performed to identify the potential biological functions 
and pathways in which these ICH-specific aging-related genes may be involved. 
Then, PPI network was established to identify the hub genes of ICH-specific 
aging-related genes. Meanwhile, miRNA-mRNA and transcription factor (TF)-mRNA 
regulatory networks were constructed to further explore the ICH-specific 
aging-related genes regulation. The relationship between these hub genes and 
immune infiltration was also further explored. Additional single-cell RNA-seq 
analysis (scRNA-seq, GSE167593) was used to locate the hub genes in different 
cell types. Besides, expression levels of the hub genes were validated using 
clinical samples from our institute and another GEO dataset (GSE206971).
RESULTS: This study identified 24 ICH-specific aging-related genes, including 22 
up-regulated and 2 down-regulated genes. The results of GO and KEGG suggested 
that the ICH-specific aging-related genes mainly enriched in immunity and 
inflammation-related pathways, suggesting that aging may affect the ich 
pathogenesis by regulating inflammatory and immune-related pathways.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed 24 ICH-specific aging-related genes and their 
functions highly pertinent to ICH pathogenesis, providing new insights into the 
impact of aging on ICH.

BACKGROUND: Currently, the treatment and prevention of migraine remain highly 
challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR) has been widely used to explore novel 
therapeutic targets. Therefore, we performed a systematic druggable genome-wide 
MR to explore the potential therapeutic targets for migraine.
METHODS: We obtained data on druggable genes and screened for genes within brain 
expression quantitative trait locis (eQTLs) and blood eQTLs, which were then 
subjected to two-sample MR analysis and colocalization analysis with migraine 
genome-wide association studies data to identify genes highly associated with 
migraine. In addition, phenome-wide research, enrichment analysis, protein 
network construction, drug prediction, and molecular docking were performed to 
provide valuable guidance for the development of more effective and targeted 
therapeutic drugs.
RESULTS: We identified 21 druggable genes significantly associated with migraine 
(BRPF3, CBFB, CDK4, CHD4, DDIT4, EP300, EPHA5, FGFRL1, FXN, HMGCR, HVCN1, KCNK5, 
MRGPRE, NLGN2, NR1D1, PLXNB1, TGFB1, TGFB3, THRA, TLN1 and TP53), two of which 
were significant in both blood and brain (HMGCR and TGFB3). The results of 
phenome-wide research showed that HMGCR was highly correlated with low-density 
lipoprotein, and TGFB3 was primarily associated with insulin-like growth factor 
1 levels.
CONCLUSIONS: This study utilized MR and colocalization analysis to identify 21 
potential drug targets for migraine, two of which were significant in both blood 
and brain. These findings provide promising leads for more effective migraine 
treatments, potentially reducing drug development costs.

BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders (SD) are known to have a profound impact on human 
health and quality of life although their exact pathogenic mechanisms remain 
poorly understood.
METHODS: The study first accessed SD datasets from the GEO and identified DEGs. 
These DEGs were then subjected to gene set enrichment analysis. Several advanced 
techniques, including the RF, SVM-RFE, PPI networks, and LASSO methodologies, 
were utilized to identify hub genes closely associated with SD. Additionally, 
the ssGSEA approach was employed to analyze immune cell infiltration and 
functional gene set scores in SD. DEGs were also scrutinized in relation to 
miRNA, and the DGIdb database was used to explore potential pharmacological 
treatments for SD. Furthermore, in an SD murine model, the expression levels of 
these hub genes were confirmed through RT-qPCR and Western Blot analyses.
RESULTS: The findings of the study indicate that DEGs are significantly enriched 
in functions and pathways related to immune cell activity, stress response, and 
neural system regulation. The analysis of immunoinfiltration demonstrated a 
marked elevation in the levels of Activated CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the 
SD cohort, accompanied by a notable rise in Central memory CD4 T cells, Central 
memory CD8 T cells, and Natural killer T cells. Using machine learning 
algorithms, the study also identified hub genes closely associated with SD, 
including IPO9, RAP2A, DDX17, MBNL2, PIK3AP1, and ZNF385A. Based on these genes, 
an SD diagnostic model was constructed and its efficacy validated across 
multiple datasets. In the SD murine model, the mRNA and protein expressions of 
these 6 hub genes were found to be consistent with the results of the 
bioinformatics analysis.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study identified 6 genes closely linked to SD, 
which may play pivotal roles in neural system development, the immune 
microenvironment, and inflammatory responses. Additionally, the key gene-based 
SD diagnostic model constructed in this study, validated on multiple datasets 
showed a high degree of reliability and accuracy, predicting its wide potential 
for clinical applications. However, limited by the range of data sources and 
sample size, this may affect the generalizability of the results.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic low-grade inflammation of the pancreatic islets is the 
characteristic of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and some of the immune checkpoints may 
play important roles in the pancreatic islet inflammation. Thus, we aim to 
explore the immune checkpoint genes (ICGs) associated with T2D, thereby 
revealing the role of ICGs in the pathogenesis of T2D based on bioinformatic 
analyses.
METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and immune checkpoint genes 
(ICGs) of islets between T2D and control group were screened from datasets of 
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). A risk model was built based on the 
coefficients of ICGs calculated by ridge regression. Functional enrichment 
analysis and immune cell infiltration estimation were conducted. Correlations 
between ICGs and hub genes, T2D-related disease genes, insulin secretion genes, 
and beta cell function-related genes were analyzed. Finally, we conducted RT-PCR 
to verify the expression of these ICGs.
RESULTS: In total, pancreatic islets from 19 cases of T2D and 84 healthy 
subjects were included. We identified 458 DEGs. Six significantly upregulated 
ICGs (CD44, CD47, HAVCR2, SIRPA, TNFSF9, and VTCN1) in T2D were screened out. 
These ICGs were significantly correlated with several hub genes and T2D-related 
genes; furthermore, they were correlated with insulin secretion and β cell 
function-related genes. The analysis of immune infiltration showed that the 
concentrations of eosinophils, T cells CD4 naive, and T cells regulatory (Tregs) 
were significantly higher, but CD4 memory resting T cells and monocytes were 
lower in islets of T2D patients. The infiltrated immune cells in T2D pancreatic 
islet were associated with these six ICGs. Finally, the expression levels of 
four ICGs were confirmed by RT-PCR, and three ICGs were validated in another 
independent dataset.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the identified ICGs may play an important role in 
T2D. Identification of these differential genes may provide new clues for the 
diagnosis and treatment of T2D.

BACKGROUND: Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common heart disorder characterized 
by an excessive production of proteoglycans and extracellular matrix in mitral 
valve leaflets. Large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) underlined that 
MVP is heritable. The molecular underpinnings of the disease remain largely 
unknown.
METHODS: We interrogated cross-modality data totaling more than 500,000 subjects 
including GWAS, 4809 molecules of the blood proteome, and genome-wide expression 
of mitral valves to identify candidate drivers of MVP. Data were investigated 
through Mendelian randomization, network analysis, ligand-receptor inference and 
digital cell quantification.
RESULTS: In this study, Mendelian randomization identify that 33 blood proteins, 
enriched in networks for immunity, are associated with the risk of MVP. MVP- 
associated blood proteins are enriched in ligands for which their cognate 
receptors are differentially expressed in mitral valve leaflets during MVP and 
enriched in cardiac endothelial cells and macrophages. MVP-associated blood 
proteins are involved in the renewal-polarization of macrophages and regulation 
of adaptive immune response. Cytokine activity profiling and digital cell 
quantification show in MVP a shift toward cytokine signature promoting M2 
macrophage polarization. Assessment of druggability identify CSF1R, CX3CR1, 
CCR6, IL33, MMP8, ENPEP and angiotensin receptors as actionable targets in MVP.
CONCLUSIONS: Hence, integrative analysis identifies networks of candidate 
molecules and cells involved in immune control and remodeling of the 
extracellular matrix, which drive the risk of MVP.

Plain Language Summary: One cause of heart disease is mitral valve prolapse, 
where heart valve thickening leads to malfunction. Biological factors that 
contribute to this occurrence are largely unknown. We took advantage of 
different public resources and independent datasets to conduct different 
converging analyses to identify relevant biological factors. Using genetic 
variation, we implemented a technique to assess the role of circulating blood 
proteins on the risk of the disease. We report that blood proteins involved in 
the regulation of the immune response promote a dysfunctional tissue repair 
process of the mitral valve. This study has highlighted a contribution of blood 
proteins that promote excessive tissue repair leading to mitral valve 
dysfunction. Several of the identified proteins are potential pharmacological 
targets that could be singled out in future efforts to halt the progression of 
the disease.

INTRODUCTION: Current therapeutic management of lupus nephritis (LN) fails to 
induce long-term remission in over 50% of patients, highlighting the urgent need 
for additional options.
METHODS: We analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in peripheral blood 
from patients with active LN (n = 41) and active nonrenal lupus (n = 62) versus 
healthy controls (HCs) (n = 497) from the European PRECISESADS project 
(NTC02890121), and dysregulated gene modules in a discovery (n = 26) and a 
replication (n = 15) set of active LN cases.
RESULTS: Replicated gene modules qualified for correlation analyses with 
serologic markers, and regulatory network and druggability analysis. 
Unsupervised coexpression network analysis revealed 20 dysregulated gene modules 
and stratified the active LN population into 3 distinct subgroups. These 
subgroups were characterized by low, intermediate, and high interferon (IFN) 
signatures, with differential dysregulation of the "B cell" and "plasma 
cells/Ig" modules. Drugs annotated to the IFN network included CC-motif 
chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1) inhibitors, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
inhibitors, and irinotecan; whereas the anti-CD38 daratumumab and proteasome 
inhibitor bortezomib showed potential for counteracting the "plasma cells/Ig" 
signature. In silico analysis demonstrated the low-IFN subgroup to benefit from 
calcineurin inhibition and the intermediate-IFN subgroup from B-cell targeted 
therapies. High-IFN patients exhibited greater anticipated response to 
anifrolumab whereas daratumumab appeared beneficial to the intermediate-IFN and 
high-IFN subgroups.
CONCLUSION: IFN upregulation and B and plasma cell gene dysregulation patterns 
revealed 3 subgroups of LN, which may not necessarily represent distinct disease 
phenotypes but rather phases of the inflammatory processes during a renal flare, 
providing a conceptual framework for precision medicine in LN.

Unexplained recurrent miscarriage (URM) is a common pregnancy complication with 
few effective therapies. Moreover, little is known regarding the role of 
pyroptosis in the regulation of the URM immune microenvironment. To address this 
issue, gene expression profiles of publicly available placental datasets 
GSE22490 and GSE76862 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. 
Pyroptosis-related differentially expressed genes were identified and a total of 
16 differentially expressed genes associated with pyroptosis were detected, 
among which 1 was upregulated and 15 were downregulated. Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses indicated that the 
functionally enriched modules and pathways of these genes are closely related to 
immune and inflammatory responses. Four hub genes were identified: BTK, TLR8, 
NLRC4, and TNFSF13B. BTK, TLR8, and TNFSF13B were highly connected with immune 
cells, according to the correlation analysis of four hub genes and 20 different 
types of immune cells (p < 0.05). The four hub genes were used as research 
objects to construct the interaction networks. Chorionic villus tissue was used 
for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot to confirm 
the expression levels of hub genes, and the results showed that the expression 
of the four hub genes was significantly decreased in the chorionic villus tissue 
in the URM group. Collectively, the present study indicates that perhaps 
pyroptosis is essential to the diversity and complexity of the URM immune 
microenvironment, and provides a theoretical basis and research ideas for 
subsequent target gene verification and mechanism research.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, 
and its pathological mechanisms are thought to be closely linked to apoptosis. 
Anoikis, a specific type of apoptosis, has recently been suggested to play a 
role in the progression of Parkinson's disease; however, the underlying 
mechanisms are not well understood. To explore the potential mechanisms involved 
in PD, we selected genes from the GSE28894 dataset and compared their expression 
in PD patients and healthy controls to identify differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs), and selected anoikis-related genes (ANRGs) from the DEGs. Furthermore, 
the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression approach 
and multivariate logistic regression highlighted five key genes-GSK3B, PCNA, 
CDC42, DAPK2, and SRC-as biomarker candidates. Subsequently, we developed a 
nomogram model incorporating these 5 genes along with age and sex to predict and 
diagnose PD. To evaluate the model's coherence, clinical applicability, and 
distinguishability, we utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, 
the C-index, and calibration curves and validated it in both the GSE20295 
dataset and our center's external clinical data. In addition, we confirmed the 
differential expression of the 5 model genes in human blood samples through 
qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Our constructed anoikis-related PD diagnostic 
model exhibits satisfactory predictive accuracy and offers novel insights into 
both diagnosis and treatment strategies for Parkinson's disease while 
facilitating its implementation in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: The cardiac-brain connection has been identified as the basis for 
multiple cardio-cerebral diseases. However, effective therapeutic targets for 
these diseases are still limited. Therefore, this study aimed to identify 
pleiotropic and specific therapeutic targets for cardio-cerebral diseases using 
Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses.
METHODS: This study included two large protein quantitative trait loci studies 
with over 4,000 plasma proteins were included in the discovery and replication 
cohorts, respectively. We initially used MR to estimate the associations between 
protein and 20 cardio-cerebral diseases. Subsequently, Colocalization analysis 
was employed to enhance the credibility of the results. Protein target 
prioritization was based solely on including highly robust significant results 
from both the discovery and replication phases. Lastly, the Drug-Gene 
Interaction Database was utilized to investigate protein-gene-drug interactions 
further.
RESULTS: A total of 46 target proteins for cardio-cerebral diseases were 
identified as robust in the discovery and replication phases by MR, comprising 7 
pleiotropic therapeutic proteins and 39 specific target proteins. Followed by 
colocalization analysis and prioritization of evidence grades for target 
protein, 6 of these protein-disease pairs have achieved the highly recommended 
level. For instance, the PILRA protein presents a pleiotropic effect on sick 
sinus syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, whereas GRN exerts specific effects on 
the latter. APOL3, LRP4, and F11, on the other hand, have specific effects on 
cardiomyopathy and ischemic stroke, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully identified important therapeutic targets 
for cardio-cerebral diseases, which benefits the development of preventive or 
therapeutic drugs.

Headache disorders are the most common disorders of the nervous system. The 
lifetime prevalence of headache disorders show that some individuals never 
experience headache. The etiology of complete freedom from headache is not 
known. To assess genetic variants associated with complete freedom from 
headache, we performed a genome-wide association study of individuals who have 
never experienced a headache. We included 63,992 individuals (2,998 individuals 
with complete freedom from headache and 60,994 controls) from the Danish Blood 
Donor Study Genomic Cohort. Participants were included in two rounds, from 2015 
to 2018 and in 2020. We discovered a genome-wide significant association, with 
the lead variant rs7904615[G] in ADARB2 (EAF = 27%, OR = 1.20 [1.13-1.27], 
p = 3.92 × 10-9). The genomic locus was replicated in a non-overlapping cohort 
of 13,032 individuals (539 individuals with complete freedom from headache and 
12,493 controls) from the Danish Blood Donor Study Genomic Cohort (p < 0.05, 
two-sided). Participants for the replication were included from 2015 to 2020. In 
conclusion, we show that complete freedom from headache has a genetic component, 
and we suggest that ADARB2 is involved in complete freedom from headache. The 
genomic locus was specific for complete freedom from headache and was not 
associated with any primary headache disorders.

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense promise for accelerating and 
improving all aspects of drug discovery, not least target discovery and 
validation. By integrating a diverse range of biological data modalities, AI 
enables the accurate prediction of drug target properties, ultimately 
illuminating biological mechanisms of disease and guiding drug discovery 
strategies. Despite the indisputable potential of AI in drug target discovery, 
there are many challenges and obstacles yet to be overcome, including dealing 
with data biases, model interpretability and generalisability, and the 
validation of predicted drug targets, to name a few. By exploring recent 
advancements in AI, this review showcases current applications of AI for drug 
target discovery and offers perspectives on the future of AI for the discovery 
and validation of drug targets, paving the way for the generation of novel and 
safer pharmaceuticals.

BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a complex condition with a 
significant genetic component. This study explored circulating proteins as 
potential genetic drug targets or biomarkers to prevent AS, addressing the need 
for innovative and safe treatments.
METHODS: We analyzed extensive data from protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) 
with up to 1,949 instrumental variables (IVs) and selected the top 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with AS risk. Utilizing a 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we assessed the causal 
relationships between identified proteins and AS risk. Colocalization analysis, 
functional enrichment, and construction of protein-protein interaction networks 
further supported these findings. We utilized phenome-wide MR (phenMR) analysis 
for broader validation and repurposing of drugs targeting these proteins. The 
Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb) was employed to corroborate drug 
associations with potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, molecular docking 
(MD) techniques were applied to evaluate the interaction between target protein 
and four potential AS drugs identified from the DGIdb.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified 1,654 plasma proteins linked to AS, with 868 
up-regulated and 786 down-regulated. 18 proteins (AGER, AIF1, ATF6B, C4A, CFB, 
CLIC1, COL11A2, ERAP1, HLA-DQA2, HSPA1L, IL23R, LILRB3, MAPK14, MICA, MICB, 
MPIG6B, TNXB, and VARS1) that show promise as therapeutic targets for AS or 
biomarkers, especially MAPK14, supported by evidence of colocalization. PhenMR 
analysis linked these proteins to AS and other diseases, while DGIdb analysis 
identified potential drugs related to MAPK14. MD analysis indicated strong 
binding affinities between MAPK14 and four potential AS drugs, suggesting 
effective target-drug interactions.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the utility of MR analysis in AS research for 
identifying biomarkers and therapeutic drug targets. The involvement of Th17 
cell differentiation-related proteins in AS pathogenesis is particularly 
notable. Clinical validation and further investigation are essential for future 
applications.

BACKGROUND: Varicose veins (VV) are a common chronic venous disease that is 
influenced by multiple factors. It affects the quality of life of patients and 
imposes a huge economic burden on the healthcare system. This study aimed to use 
integrated analysis methods, including Mendelian randomization analysis, to 
identify potential pathogenic genes and drug targets for VV treatment.
METHODS: This study conducted Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) 
analysis and colocalization analysis on data collected from genome-wide 
association studies and cis-expression quantitative trait loci databases. Only 
genes with PP.H4 > 0.7 in colocalization were chosen from the significant SMR 
results. After the above analysis, we screened 12 genes and performed Mendelian 
Randomization (MR) analysis on them. After sensitivity analysis, we identified 
four genes with potential causal relationships with VV. Finally, we used 
transcriptome-wide association studies and The Drug-Gene Interaction Database 
data to identify and screen the remaining genes and identified four drug targets 
for the treatment of VV.
RESULTS: We identified four genes significantly associated with VV, namely, 
KRTAP5-AS1 [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.05-1.11, p = 
1.42e-10] and PLEKHA5 (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06-1.20, p = 6.90e-5), CBWD1 (OR = 
1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11, p = 1.42e-2) and CRIM1 (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.95, p 
= 3.67e-3). Increased expression of three genes, namely, KRTAP5-AS1, PLEKHA5, 
and CBWD1, was associated with increased risk of the disease, and increased 
expression of CRIM1 was associated with decreased risk of the disease. These 
four genes could be targeted for VV therapy.
CONCLUSION: We identified four potential causal proteins for varicose veins with 
MR. A comprehensive analysis indicated that KRTAP5-AS1, PLEKHA5, CBWD1, and 
CRIM1 might be potential drug targets for varicose veins.

BACKGROUND: Exploring the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) is important for 
its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Therefore, we aimed to construct novel 
signature genes (c-FRGs) combining cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) with 
ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) to explore the pathogenesis of OA and aid in 
its treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differentially expressed c-FRGs (c-FDEGs) were obtained 
using R software. Enrichment analysis was performed and a protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on these c-FDEGs. Then, seven 
hub genes were screened. Three machine learning methods and verification 
experiments were used to identify four signature biomarkers from c-FDEGs, after 
which gene set enrichment analysis, gene set variation analysis, single-sample 
gene set enrichment analysis, immune function analysis, drug prediction, and 
ceRNA network analysis were performed based on these signature biomarkers. 
Subsequently, a disease model of OA was constructed using these biomarkers and 
validated on the GSE82107 dataset. Finally, we analyzed the distribution of the 
expression of these c-FDEGs in various cell populations.
RESULTS: A total of 63 FRGs were found to be closely associated with 11 CRGs, 
and 40 c-FDEGs were identified. Bioenrichment analysis showed that they were 
mainly associated with inflammation, external cellular stimulation, and 
autophagy. CDKN1A, FZD7, GABARAPL2, and SLC39A14 were identified as OA signature 
biomarkers, and their corresponding miRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted. Finally, 
scRNA-seq data analysis showed that the differentially expressed c-FRGs had 
significantly different expression distributions across the cell populations.
CONCLUSION: Four genes, namely CDKN1A, FZD7, GABARAPL2, and SLC39A14, are 
excellent biomarkers and prospective therapeutic targets for OA.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a dangerous cardiovascular disease, which 
often brings great psychological burden and economic pressure to patients. If 
AAA rupture occurs, it is a serious threat to patients' lives. Therefore, it is 
of clinical value to actively explore the pathogenesis of ruptured AAA and 
prevent its occurrence. Ferroptosis is a new type of cell death dependent on 
lipid peroxidation, which plays an important role in many cardiovascular 
diseases. In this study, we used online data and analysis of ferroptosis-related 
genes to uncover the formation of ruptured AAA and potential therapeutic 
targets. We obtained ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes 
(Fe-DEGs) from GSE98278 dataset and 259 known ferroptosis-related genes from 
FerrDb website. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was 
performed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes 
(KEGG). Receiver Operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to evaluate 
the diagnostic abilities of Fe-DEGs. Transcription factors and miRNAs of Fe-DEGs 
were identified through PASTAA and miRDB, miRWalk, TargetScan respectively. 
Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to observe immune 
infiltration between the stable group and the rupture group. DGIdb database was 
performed to find potential targeted drugs of DEGs. GO and KEGG enrichment 
analysis found that DEGs mainly enriched in "cellular divalent inorganic cation 
homeostasis," "cellular zinc ion homeostasis," "divalent inorganic cation 
homeostasis," "Mineral absorption," "Cytokine - cytokine receptor interaction," 
"Coronavirus disease - COVID-19." Two up-regulated Fe-DEGs MT1G and DDIT4 were 
found to further analysis. Both single and combined applications of MT1G and 
DDIT4 showed good diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0.8254, 0.8548, 0.8577, 
respectively). Transcription factors STAT1 and PU1 of MT1G and ARNT and MAX of 
DDIT4 were identified. Meanwhile, has_miR-548p-MT1G pairs, 
has_miR-53-3p/has_miR-181b-5p/ has_miR-664a-3p-DDIT4 pairs were found. B cells, 
NK cells, Th2 cells were high expression in the rupture group compared with the 
stable group, while DCs, Th1 cells were low expression in the rupture group. 
Targeted drugs against immunity, GEMCITABINE and INDOMETHACIN were discovered. 
We preliminarily explored the clinical significance of Fe-DEGs MT1G and DDIT4 in 
the diagnosis of ruptured AAA, and proposed possible upstream regulatory 
transcription factors and miRNAs. In addition, we also analyzed the immune 
infiltration of stable and rupture groups, and found possible targeted drugs for 
immunotherapy.

Despite advances in treatment strategies, colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to 
cause significant morbidity and mortality, with mounting evidence a close link 
between immune system dysfunctions issued. Interleukin-2 receptor gamma (IL-2RG) 
plays a pivotal role as a common subunit receptor in the IL-2 family cytokines 
and activates the JAK-STAT pathway. This study delves into the role of 
Interleukin-2 receptor gamma (IL-2RG) within the tumor microenvironment and 
investigates potential microRNAs (miRNAs) that directly inhibit IL-2RG, aiming 
to discern their impact on CRC clinical outcomes. Bioinformatics analysis 
revealed a significant upregulation of IL-2RG mRNA in TCGA-COAD samples and 
showed strong correlations with the infiltration of various lymphocytes. 
Single-cell analysis corroborated these findings, highlighting IL-2RG expression 
in critical immune cell subsets. To explore miRNA involvement in IL-2RG 
dysregulation, mRNA was isolated from the tumor tissues and lymphocytes of 258 
CRC patients and 30 healthy controls, and IL-2RG was cloned into the 
pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO vector. Human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK-293T) were 
transfected with this construct. Our research involved a comprehensive analysis 
of miRPathDB, miRWalk, and Targetscan databases to identify the miRNAs 
associated with the 3' UTR of human IL-2RG. The human microRNA (miRNA) 
molecules, hsa-miR-7-5p and hsa-miR-26b-5p, have been identified as potent 
suppressors of IL-2RG expression in CRC patients. Specifically, the 
downregulation of hsa-miR-7-5p and hsa-miR-26b-5p has been shown to result in 
the upregulation of IL-2RG mRNA expression in these patients. Prognostic 
evaluation of IL-2RG, hsa-miR-7-5p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p, using TCGA-COAD data and 
patient samples, established that higher IL-2RG expression and lower expression 
of both miRNAs were associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, this study 
identified several long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs), such as ZFAS1, SOX21-AS1, 
SNHG11, SNHG16, SNHG1, DLX6-AS1, GAS5, SNHG6, and MALAT1, which may act as 
competing endogenous RNA molecules for IL2RG by sequestering shared hsa-miR-7-5p 
and hsa-miR-26b-5p. In summary, this investigation underscores the potential 
utility of IL-2RG, hsa-miR-7-5p, and hsa-miR-26b-5p as serum and tissue 
biomarkers for predicting CRC patient prognosis while also offering promise as 
targets for immunotherapy in CRC management.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal cancer characterized by a 
poor outcome and an increasing incidence. A significant majority (>80%) of newly 
diagnosed cases are deemed unresectable, leaving chemotherapy as the sole viable 
option, though with only moderate success. This necessitates the identification 
of improved therapeutic options for PDA. We hypothesized that there are temporal 
variations in cancer-relevant processes within PDA tumors, offering insights 
into the optimal timing of drug administration - a concept termed chronotherapy. 
In this study, we explored the presence of the circadian transcriptome in PDA 
using patient-derived organoids and validated these findings by comparing PDA 
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas with noncancerous healthy pancreas data from 
GTEx. Several PDA-associated pathways (cell cycle, stress response, Rho GTPase 
signaling) and cancer driver hub genes (EGFR and JUN) exhibited a 
cancer-specific rhythmic pattern intricately linked to the circadian clock. 
Through the integration of multiple functional measurements for rhythmic cancer 
driver genes, we identified top chronotherapy targets and validated key findings 
in molecularly divergent pancreatic cancer cell lines. Testing the 
chemotherapeutic efficacy of clinically relevant drugs further revealed temporal 
variations that correlated with drug-target cycling. Collectively, our study 
unravels the PDA circadian transcriptome and highlights a potential approach for 
optimizing chrono-chemotherapeutic efficacy.

Alzheimer's disease is the main cause of aging-associated dementia, for which 
there is no effective treatment. In this work, we reanalyze the information of a 
previous genome wide association study, using a new pipeline design to identify 
novel potential drugs. With this approach, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase 
gene (RRM2B) emerged as a candidate target and its inhibitor, 2', 2'-difluoro 
2'deoxycytidine (gemcitabine), as a potential pharmaceutical drug against 
Alzheimer's disease. We functionally verified the effect of inhibiting the RRM2B 
homolog, rnr-2, in an Alzheimer's model of Caenorhabditis elegans, which 
accumulates human Aβ1-42 peptide to an irreversible paralysis. RNA interference 
against rnr-2 and also treatment with 200 ng/ml of gemcitabine, showed an 
improvement of the phenotype. Gemcitabine treatment increased the intracellular 
ATP level 3.03 times, which may point to its mechanism of action. Gemcitabine 
has been extensively used in humans for cancer treatment but at higher 
concentrations. The 200 ng/ml concentration did not exert a significant effect 
over cell cycle, or affected cell viability when assayed in the microglia N13 
cell line. Thus, the inhibitory drug of the RRM2B activity could be of potential 
use to treat Alzheimer's disease and particularly gemcitabine might be 
considered as a promising candidate to be repurposed for its treatment.

Cancer immunotherapy has brought about a revolutionary breakthrough in the field 
of cancer treatment. Immunotherapy has changed the treatment landscape for a 
variety of solid and hematologic malignancies. To assist researchers in 
efficiently uncovering valuable information related to cancer immunotherapy, we 
have presented a manually curated comprehensive database called DIRMC, which 
focuses on molecular features involved in cancer immunotherapy. All the content 
was collected manually from published literature, authoritative clinical trial 
data submitted by clinicians, some databases for drug target prediction such as 
DrugBank, and some experimentally confirmed high-throughput data sets for the 
characterization of immune-related molecular interactions in cancer, such as a 
curated database of T-cell receptor sequences with known antigen specificity 
(VDJdb), a pathology-associated TCR database (McPAS-TCR) et al. By constructing 
a fully connected functional network, ranging from cancer-related gene mutations 
to target genes to translated target proteins to protein regions or sites that 
may specifically affect protein function, we aim to comprehensively characterize 
molecular features related to cancer immunotherapy. We have developed the 
scoring criteria to assess the reliability of each MHC-peptide-T-cell receptor 
(TCR) interaction item to provide a reference for users. The database provides a 
user-friendly interface to browse and retrieve data by genes, target proteins, 
diseases and more. DIRMC also provides a download and submission page for 
researchers to access data of interest for further investigation or submit new 
interactions related to cancer immunotherapy targets. Furthermore, DIRMC 
provides a graphical interface to help users predict the binding affinity 
between their own peptide of interest and MHC or TCR. This database will provide 
researchers with a one-stop resource to understand cancer immunotherapy-related 
targets as well as data on MHC-peptide-TCR interactions. It aims to offer 
reliable molecular characteristics support for both the analysis of the current 
status of cancer immunotherapy and the development of new immunotherapy. DIRMC 
is available at http://www.dirmc.tech/. Database URL: http://www.dirmc.tech/.

Identifying genes with prognostic significance that can act as biomarkers in 
solid tumors can help stratify patients and uncover novel therapy targets. Here, 
our goal was to expand our previous ranking analysis of survival-associated 
genes in various solid tumors to include colon cancer specimens with available 
transcriptomic and clinical data. A Gene Expression Omnibus search was performed 
to identify available datasets with clinical data and raw gene expression 
measurements. A combined database was set up and integrated into our 
Kaplan-Meier plotter, making it possible to identify genes with expression 
changes linked to altered survival. As a demonstration of the utility of the 
platform, the most powerful genes linked to overall survival in colon cancer 
were identified using uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The 
combined colon cancer database includes 2,137 tumor samples from 17 independent 
cohorts. The most significant genes associated with relapse-free survival with a 
false discovery rate below 1% in colon cancer carcinoma were RBPMS (hazard rate 
[HR] = 2.52), TIMP1 (HR = 2.44), and COL4A2 (HR = 2.36). The three strongest 
genes associated with shorter survival in stage II colon cancer include CSF1R 
(HR = 2.86), FLNA (HR = 2.88), and TPBG (HR = 2.65). In summary, a new 
integrated database for colon cancer is presented. A colon cancer analysis 
subsystem was integrated into our Kaplan-Meier plotter that can be used to mine 
the entire database (https://www.kmplot.com). The portal has the potential to be 
employed for the identification and prioritization of promising biomarkers and 
therapeutic target candidates in multiple solid tumors including, among others, 
breast, lung, ovarian, gastric, pancreatic, and colon cancers.

Desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCT) are a type of aggressive, pediatric 
sarcoma characterized by the EWSR1::WT1 fusion oncogene. Targeted therapies for 
DSRCT have not been developed, and standard multimodal therapy is insufficient, 
leading to a 5-year survival rate of only 15% to 25%. Here, we depleted 
EWSR1::WT1 in DSRCT and established its essentiality in vivo. Transcriptomic 
analysis revealed that EWSR1::WT1 induces unique transcriptional alterations 
compared with WT1 and other fusion oncoproteins and that EWSR1::WT1 binding 
directly mediates gene upregulation. The E-KTS isoform of EWSR1::WT1 played a 
dominant role in transcription, and it bound to the CCND1 promoter and 
stimulated DSRCT growth through the cyclin D-CDK4/6-RB axis. Treatment with the 
CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib successfully reduced growth in two DSRCT xenograft 
models. As palbociclib has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast 
cancer, these findings demonstrate the sensitivity of DSRCT to palbociclib and 
support immediate clinical investigation of palbociclib for treating this 
aggressive pediatric cancer.
SIGNIFICANCE: EWSR1::WT1 is essential for desmoplastic small round cell tumors 
and upregulates the cyclin D-CDK4/6-RB axis that can be targeted with 
palbociclib, providing a targeted therapeutic strategy for treating this deadly 
tumor type.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetics are characterized by lower 
discoverability than most other psychiatric disorders. The contribution to 
biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We 
performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies 
across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 
admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases). We 
identified 95 genome-wide significant loci (80 new). Convergent multi-omic 
approaches identified 43 potential causal genes, broadly classified as 
neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic modulators (for example, GRIA1, GRM8 
and CACNA1E), developmental, axon guidance and transcription factors (for 
example, FOXP2, EFNA5 and DCC), synaptic structure and function genes (for 
example, PCLO, NCAM1 and PDE4B) and endocrine or immune regulators (for example, 
ESR1, TRAF3 and TANK). Additional top genes influence stress, immune, fear and 
threat-related processes, previously hypothesized to underlie PTSD neurobiology. 
These findings strengthen our understanding of neurobiological systems relevant 
to PTSD pathophysiology, while also opening new areas for investigation.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease with an overall 
5-year survival rate of <12% due to the lack of effective treatments. Novel 
treatment strategies are urgently needed. Here, PKMYT1 is identified through 
genome-wide CRISPR screens as a non-mutant, genetic vulnerability of PDAC. 
Higher PKMYT1 expression levels indicate poor prognosis in PDAC patients. PKMYT1 
ablation inhibits tumor growth and proliferation in vitro and in vivo by 
regulating cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, 
pharmacological inhibition of PKMYT1 shows efficacy in multiple PDAC cell models 
and effectively induces tumor regression without overt toxicity in PDAC cell 
line-derived xenograft and in more clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft 
models. Mechanistically, in addition to its canonical function of 
phosphorylating CDK1, PKMYT1 functions as an oncogene to promote PDAC 
tumorigenesis by regulating PLK1 expression and phosphorylation. Finally, TP53 
function and PRKDC activation are shown to modulate the sensitivity to PKMYT1 
inhibition. These results define PKMYT1 dependency in PDAC and identify 
potential therapeutic strategies for clinical translation.

BACKGROUND: This study focused on circulating plasma protein profiles to 
identify mediators of hypertension-driven myocardial remodeling and heart 
failure.
METHODS: A Mendelian randomization design was used to investigate the causal 
impact of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and 
pulse pressure on 82 cardiac magnetic resonance traits and heart failure risk. 
Mediation analyses were also conducted to identify potential plasma proteins 
mediating these effects.
RESULTS: Genetically proxied higher SBP, DBP, and pulse pressure were causally 
associated with increased left ventricular myocardial mass and alterations in 
global myocardial wall thickness at end diastole. Elevated SBP and DBP were 
linked to increased regional myocardial radial strain of the left ventricle 
(basal anterior, mid, and apical walls), while higher SBP was associated with 
reduced circumferential strain in specific left ventricular segments (apical, 
mid-anteroseptal, mid-inferoseptal, and mid-inferolateral walls). Specific 
plasma proteins mediated the impact of blood pressure on cardiac remodeling, 
with FGF5 (fibroblast growth factor 5) contributing 2.96% (P=0.024) and 4.15% 
(P=0.046) to the total effect of SBP and DBP on myocardial wall thickness at end 
diastole in the apical anterior segment and leptin explaining 15.21% (P=0.042) 
and 23.24% (P=0.022) of the total effect of SBP and DBP on radial strain in the 
mid-anteroseptal segment. Additionally, FGF5 was the only mediator, explaining 
4.19% (P=0.013) and 4.54% (P=0.032) of the total effect of SBP and DBP on heart 
failure susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: This mediation Mendelian randomization study provides evidence 
supporting specific circulating plasma proteins as mediators of 
hypertension-driven cardiac remodeling and heart failure.

BACKGROUND: Higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in serum has a 
positive association with pulmonary function. Investigating genome-wide 
interactions with 25(OH)D may reveal new biological insights into pulmonary 
function.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify novel genetic variants associated with 
pulmonary function by accounting for 25(OH)D interactions.
METHODS: We included 211,264 participants from the observational United Kingdom 
Biobank study with pulmonary function tests (PFTs), genome-wide genotypes, and 
25(OH)D concentrations from 4 ancestral backgrounds-European, African, East 
Asian, and South Asian. Among PFTs, we focused on forced expiratory volume in 
the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) because both were 
previously associated with 25(OH)D. We performed genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) analyses that accounted for variant×25(OH)D interaction using the joint 2 
degree-of-freedom (2df) method, stratified by participants' smoking history and 
ancestry, and meta-analyzed results. We evaluated interaction effects to 
determine how variant-PFT associations were modified by 25(OH)D concentrations 
and conducted pathway enrichment analysis to examine the biological relevance of 
our findings.
RESULTS: Our GWAS meta-analyses, accounting for interaction with 25(OH)D, 
revealed 30 genetic variants significantly associated with FEV1 or FVC (P2df 
<5.00×10-8) that were not previously reported for PFT-related traits. These 
novel variant signals were enriched in lung function-relevant pathways, 
including the p38 MAPK pathway. Among variants with genome-wide-significant 2df 
results, smoking-stratified meta-analyses identified 5 variants with 25(OH)D 
interactions that influenced FEV1 in both smoking groups (never smokers P1df 
interaction<2.65×10-4; ever smokers P1df interaction<1.71×10-5); rs3130553, 
rs2894186, rs79277477, and rs3130929 associations were only evident in never 
smokers, and the rs4678408 association was only found in ever smokers.
CONCLUSION: Genetic variant associations with lung function can be modified by 
25(OH)D, and smoking history can further modify variant×25(OH)D interactions. 
These results expand the known genetic architecture of pulmonary function and 
add evidence that gene-environment interactions, including with 25(OH)D and 
smoking, influence lung function.

Patients with severe mental disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), 
schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) show a substantial 
reduction in life expectancy, increased incidence of comorbid medical conditions 
commonly observed with advanced age and alterations of aging hallmarks. While 
severe mental disorders are heritable, the extent to which genetic 
predisposition might contribute to accelerated cellular aging is not known. We 
used bivariate causal mixture models to quantify the trait-specific and shared 
architecture of mental disorders and 2 aging hallmarks (leukocyte telomere 
length [LTL] and mitochondrial DNA copy number), and the conjunctional false 
discovery rate method to detect shared genetic loci. We integrated gene 
expression data from brain regions from GTEx and used different tools to 
functionally annotate identified loci and investigate their druggability. Aging 
hallmarks showed low polygenicity compared with severe mental disorders. We 
observed a significant negative global genetic correlation between MDD and LTL 
(rg = -0.14, p = 6.5E-10), and no significant results for other severe mental 
disorders or for mtDNA-cn. However, conditional QQ plots and bivariate causal 
mixture models pointed to significant pleiotropy among all severe mental 
disorders and aging hallmarks. We identified genetic variants significantly 
shared between LTL and BD (n = 17), SCZ (n = 55) or MDD (n = 19), or mtDNA-cn 
and BD (n = 4), SCZ (n = 12) or MDD (n = 1), with mixed direction of effects. 
The exonic rs7909129 variant in the SORCS3 gene, encoding a member of the 
retromer complex involved in protein trafficking and intracellular/intercellular 
signaling, was associated with shorter LTL and increased predisposition to all 
severe mental disorders. Genetic variants underlying risk of SCZ or MDD and 
shorter LTL modulate expression of several druggable genes in different brain 
regions. Genistein, a phytoestrogen with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
effects, was an upstream regulator of 2 genes modulated by variants associated 
with risk of MDD and shorter LTL. While our results suggest that shared 
heritability might play a limited role in contributing to accelerated cellular 
aging in severe mental disorders, we identified shared genetic determinants and 
prioritized different druggable targets and compounds.

INTRODUCTION: We aim to assess the association between smoking behavior and 
intracranial aneurysms (IAs) and the effect of smoking cessation medications on 
IAs at the genetic level.
METHODS: Causal effects of four phenotypes: 1) age at initiation of regular 
smoking, 2) cigarettes smoked per day, 3) smoking cessation, and 4) smoking 
initiation on IAs, were analyzed using two-sample inverse-variance weighted 
Mendelian randomization analyses. The effects of genes interacting with the 
smoking cessation medications were analyzed using cis-expression quantitative 
trait loci genetic instruments on IAs using summary statistics-based Mendelian 
randomization analyses. Colocalization analyses were then used to test whether 
the genes shared causal variants with IAs. The role of confounding phenotypes as 
potential causative mechanisms of IAs at these gene loci was tested.
RESULTS: Cigarettes smoked per day (OR=2.89; 95% CI:1.85-4.51) and smoking 
initiation on IAs (OR=4.64; 95% CI: 2.64-8.15) were significantly associated 
with IA risk. However, age at initiation of regular smoking (OR=0.54; 95% CI: 
0.10-2.8) and smoking cessation (OR=6.80; 95% CI: 0.01-4812) had no overall 
effect on IAs. Of 88 genes that interacted with smoking cessation medications, 
two had a causal effect on IA risk. Genetic variants affecting HYKK levels 
showed strong evidence of colocalization with IA risk. Higher HYKK levels in the 
blood were associated with a lower IA risk. Gene target analyses revealed that 
cigarettes/day could be a main mediator of HYKK's effect on IA risk.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence supporting that smoking initiation on 
IAs and cigarettes/day may increase IA risk. Increased HYKK gene expression may 
reduce IA risk. This can be explained by the increased number of cigarettes 
consumed daily. HYKK could also reduce IA risk due to the positive effect of 
continuous abstinence and varenicline therapy on smoking cessation.

Cancer development is driven by an accumulation of a small number of driver 
genetic mutations that confer the selective growth advantage to the cell, while 
most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. The 
identification of these driver genes responsible for tumorigenesis is a crucial 
step in designing effective cancer treatments. Although many computational 
methods have been developed with this purpose, the majority of existing methods 
solely provided a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients, 
ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients. It remains 
challenging to identify the personalized driver genes. Here, we propose a novel 
method (PDRWH), which aims to prioritize the mutated genes of a single patient 
based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a 
group of patients who share the co-mutation genes and similar gene expression 
profiles. The wide experimental results on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA showed 
that PDRWH excels in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific 
drivers. In the comparative testing across five cancer types, PDRWH outperformed 
existing individual-level methods as well as cohort-level methods. Our results 
also demonstrated that PDRWH could identify both common and rare drivers. The 
personalized driver profiles could improve tumor stratification, providing new 
insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity and taking a further step toward 
personalized treatment. We also validated one of our predicted novel 
personalized driver genes on tumor cell proliferation by vitro cell-based 
assays, the promoting effect of the high expression of Low-density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on tumor cell proliferation.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) is a highly prevalent disorder 
characterized by persistent nasal and sinus mucosa inflammation. Despite 
significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, there are limited effective 
treatment options for such a disease. Therefore, identifying causal genes and 
dysregulated pathways paves the way for novel therapeutic interventions. In the 
current study, a three-way interaction approach was used to detect dynamic 
co-expression interactions involved in CRSwNP. In this approach, the internal 
evolution of the co-expression relation between a pair of genes (X, Y) was 
captured under a change in the expression profile of a third gene (Z), named the 
switch gene. Subsequently, the biological relevancy of the statistically 
significant triplets was confirmed using both gene set enrichment analysis and 
gene regulatory network reconstruction. Finally, the importance of identified 
switch genes was confirmed using a random forest model. The results suggested 
four dysregulated pathways in CRSwNP, including "positive regulation of 
intracellular signal transduction", "arachidonic acid metabolic process", 
"spermatogenesis" and "negative regulation of cellular protein metabolic 
process". Additionally, the S100a9 as a switch gene together with the gene pair 
{Cd14, Tpd52l1} form a biologically relevant triplet. More specifically, we 
suggested that S100a9 might act as a potential upstream modulator in toll-like 
receptor 4 transduction pathway in the major CRSwNP pathologies.

Cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS) has the characteristics of a high incidence, 
disability, and mortality rate. Here, we aimed to explore the potential 
pathogenic mechanisms of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in CIS. Three 
microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were 
utilized to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CIS and normal 
controls. FRGs were obtained from a literature report and the FerrDb database. 
Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network were used to screen hub genes. The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve was adopted to evaluate the diagnostic value of key 
genes in CIS, followed by analysis of immune microenvironment, transcription 
factor (TF) regulatory network, drug prediction, and molecular docking. In 
total, 128 CIS samples were divided into 2 subgroups after clustering analysis. 
Compared with cluster A, 1560 DEGs were identified in cluster B. After the 
construction of the WGCNA and PPI network, 5 hub genes, including MAPK3, WAS, 
DNAJC5, PRKCD, and GRB2, were identified for CIS. Interestingly, MAPK3 was a FRG 
that differentially expressed between cluster A and cluster B. The expression 
levels of 5 hub genes were all specifically highly in cluster A subtype. It is 
noted that neutrophils were the most positively correlated with all 5 real hub 
genes. PRKCD was one of the target genes of FASUDIL. In conclusion, five real 
hub genes were identified as potential diagnostic markers, which can distinguish 
the two subtypes well.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a persistent autoimmune condition characterized by 
synovitis and joint damage. Recent findings suggest a potential link to abnormal 
lactate metabolism. This study aims to identify lactate metabolism-related genes 
(LMRGs) in RA and investigate their correlation with the molecular mechanisms of 
RA immunity. Data on the gene expression profiles of RA synovial tissue samples 
were acquired from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. The RA database 
was acquired by obtaining the common LMRDEGs, and selecting the gene collection 
through an SVM model. Conducting the functional enrichment analysis, followed by 
immuno-infiltration analysis and protein-protein interaction networks. The 
results revealed that as possible markers associated with lactate metabolism in 
RA, KCNN4 and SLC25A4 may be involved in regulating macrophage function in the 
immune response to RA, whereas GATA2 is involved in the immune mechanism of DC 
cells. In conclusion, this study utilized bioinformatics analysis and machine 
learning to identify biomarkers associated with lactate metabolism in RA and 
examined their relationship with immune cell infiltration. These findings offer 
novel perspectives on potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for RA.

In HPV-associated carcinomas, some examples of cancer-related genes altered by 
viral insertion and corresponding to potential therapeutic targets have been 
described, but no quantitative assessment of these events, including poorly 
recurrent targets, has been reported to date. To document these occurrences, we 
built and analyzed a database comprised of 1455 cases, including HPV genotypes 
and tumor localizations. Host DNA sequences targeted by viral integration were 
classified as "non-recurrent" (one single reported case; 838 loci), "weakly 
recurrent" (two reported cases; 82 loci), and highly recurrent (≥3 cases; 43 
loci). Whereas the overall rate of cancer-related target genes was 3.3% in the 
Gencode database, this rate increased to 6.5% in "non-recurrent", 11.4% in 
"weakly recurrent", and 40.1% in "highly recurrent" genes targeted by 
integration (p = 4.9 × 10-4). This rate was also significantly higher in tumors 
associated with high-risk HPV16/18/45 than other genotypes. Among the genes 
targeted by HPV insertion, 30.2% corresponded to direct or indirect druggable 
targets, a rate rising to 50% in "highly recurrent" targets. Using data from the 
literature and the DepMap 23Q4 release database, we found that genes targeted by 
viral insertion could be new candidates potentially involved in HPV-associated 
oncogenesis. A more systematic characterization of HPV/host fusion DNA sequences 
in HPV-associated cancers should provide a better knowledge of HPV-driven 
carcinogenesis and favor the development of personalize patient treatments.

OBJECTIVE: Keratoconus is a commonly progressive and blinding corneal disorder. 
Iron metabolism and oxidative stress play crucial roles in both keratoconus and 
ferroptosis. However, the association between keratoconus and ferroptosis is 
currently unclear. This study aimed to analyze and verify the role of 
ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in the pathogenesis of keratoconus through 
bioinformatics.
METHODS: We first obtained keratoconus-related datasets and FRGs. Then, the 
differentially expressed FRGs (DE-FRGs) associated with keratoconus were 
screened through analysis, followed by analysis of their biological functions. 
Subsequently, the LASSO and SVM-RFE algorithms were used to screen for 
diagnostic biomarkers. GSEA was performed to explore the potential functions of 
the marker genes. Finally, the associations between these biomarkers and immune 
cells were analyzed. qRT‒PCR was used to detect the expression of these 
biomarkers in corneal tissues.
RESULTS: A total of 39 DE-FRGs were screened, and functional enrichment analysis 
revealed that the DE-FRGs were closely related to apoptosis, oxidative stress, 
and the immune response. Then, using multiple algorithms, 6 diagnostic 
biomarkers were selected, and the ROC curve was used to verify their risk 
prediction ability. In addition, based on CIBERSORT analysis, alterations in the 
immune microenvironment of keratoconus patients might be associated with H19, 
GCH1, CHAC1, and CDKN1A. Finally, qRT‒PCR confirmed that the expression of H19 
and CHAC1 was elevated in the keratoconus group.
CONCLUSION: This study identified 6 DE-FRGs, 4 of which were associated with 
immune infiltrating cells, and established a diagnostic model with predictive 
value for keratoconus.

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies highlight the genetic underpinnings of mental 
disorders comorbidity, particularly in anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. 
However, their shared genetic loci are not well understood. Our study employs 
Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses, alongside multi-omics 
data, to uncover potential genetic targets for these conditions, thereby 
informing therapeutic and drug development strategies.
METHODS: We utilized the Consortium for Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression 
(LDSC) and Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate genetic 
correlations among anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Utilizing GTEx V8 
eQTL and deCODE Genetics pQTL data, we performed a three-step summary-data-based 
Mendelian randomization (SMR) and protein-protein interaction analysis. This 
helped assess causal and comorbid loci for these disorders and determine if 
identified loci share coincidental variations with psychiatric diseases. 
Additionally, phenome-wide association studies, drug prediction, and molecular 
docking validated potential drug targets.
RESULTS: We found genetic correlations between anxiety, depression, and 
schizophrenia, and under a meta-analysis of MR from multiple databases, the 
causal relationships among these disorders are supported. Based on this, 
three-step SMR and colocalization analyses identified ITIH3 and CCS as being 
related to the risk of developing depression, while CTSS and DNPH1 are related 
to the onset of schizophrenia. BTN3A1, PSMB4, and TIMP4 were identified as 
comorbidity loci for both disorders. Molecules that could not be determined 
through colocalization analysis were also presented. Drug prediction and 
molecular docking showed that some drugs and proteins have good binding affinity 
and available structural data.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates genetic correlations and shared risk loci 
between anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. These findings offer insights 
into the underlying mechanisms of their comorbidities and aid in drug 
development.

BACKGROUND: Prompt identification and assessment of the disease are essential 
for reducing the death rate associated with colorectal cancer (COL). Identifying 
specific causal or sensitive components, such as coding RNA (cRNA) and 
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), may greatly aid in the early detection of colorectal 
cancer.
METHODS: For this purpose, we gave natural chemicals obtained from Sparassis 
latifolia (SLPs) either alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy 
(5-Fluorouracil to a mouse colorectal tumor model induced by AOM-DSS. The 
transcription profile of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and their target hub genes was 
evaluated using qPCR Real-Time, and ELISA techniques.
RESULTS: MSX2, MMP7, ITIH4, and COL1A2 were identified as factors in 
inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to the development of COL. The hub 
genes listed, upstream regulatory factors such as lncRNA PVT1, NEAT1, KCNQ1OT1, 
SNHG16, and miR-132-3p have been discovered as biomarkers for prognosis and 
diagnosis of COL. The SLPs and exercise, effectively decreased the size and 
quantity of tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: This effect may be attributed to the modulation of gene expression 
levels, including MSX2, MMP7, ITIH4, COL1A2, PVT1, NEAT1, KCNQ1OT1, SNHG16, and 
miR-132-3p. Ultimately, SLPs and exercise have the capacity to be regarded as 
complementing and enhancing chemotherapy treatments, owing to their efficacious 
components.

INTRODUCTION: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the deadliest malignancy in gynecology, but 
the mechanism of its initiation and progression is poorly elucidated. 
Disulfidptosis is a novel discovered type of regulatory cell death. This study 
aimed to develop a novel disulfidptosis-related prognostic signature (DRPS) for 
OC and explore the effects and potential treatment by disulfidptosis-related 
risk stratification.
METHODS: The disulfidptosis-related genes were first analyzed in bulk RNA-Seq 
and a prognostic nomogram was developed and validated by LASSO algorithm and 
multivariate cox regression. Then we systematically assessed the 
clinicopathological and mutational characteristics, pathway enrichment analysis, 
immune cell infiltration, single-cell-level expression, and drug sensitivity 
according to DRPS.
RESULTS: The DRPS was established with 6 genes (MYL6, PDLIM1, ACTN4, FLNB, 
SLC7A11, and CD2AP) and the corresponding prognostic nomogram was constructed 
based on the DRPS, FIGO stage, grade, and residual disease. Stratified by the 
risk score derived from DRPS, patients in high-risk group tended to have worse 
prognosis, lower level of disulfidptosis, activated oncogenic pathways, 
inhibitory tumor immune microenvironment, and higher sensitivity to specific 
drugs including epirubicin, stauroporine, navitoclax, and tamoxifen. Single-cell 
transcriptomic analysis revealed the expression level of genes in the DRPS 
significantly varied in different cell types between tumor and normal tissues. 
The protein-level expression of genes in the DRPS was validated by the 
immunohistochemical staining analysis.
CONCLUSION: In this study, the DRPS and corresponding prognostic nomogram for OC 
were developed, which was important for OC prognostic assessment, tumor 
microenvironment modification, drug sensitivity prediction, and exploration of 
potential mechanisms in tumor development.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cuproptosis has emerged as a significant contributor in the 
progression of various diseases. This study aimed to assess the potential impact 
of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) on the development of hepatic ischemia and 
reperfusion injury (HIRI).
METHODS: The datasets related to HIRI were sourced from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus database. The comparative analysis of differential gene expression 
involving CRGs was performed between HIRI and normal liver samples. Correlation 
analysis, function enrichment analyses, and protein-protein interactions were 
employed to understand the interactions and roles of these genes. Machine 
learning techniques were used to identify hub genes. Additionally, differences 
in immune cell infiltration between HIRI patients and controls were analyzed. 
Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were used to verify the 
expression of the hub genes.
RESULTS: Seventy-five HIRI and 80 control samples from three databases were 
included in the bioinformatics analysis. Three hub CRGs (NLRP3, ATP7B and 
NFE2L2) were identified using three machine learning models. Diagnostic accuracy 
was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the hub 
genes, which yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.832. Remarkably, in 
the validation datasets GSE15480 and GSE228782, the three hub genes had AUC 
reached 0.904. Additional analyses, including nomograms, decision curves, and 
calibration curves, supported their predictive power for diagnosis. Enrichment 
analyses indicated the involvement of these genes in multiple pathways 
associated with HIRI progression. Comparative assessments using CIBERSORT and 
gene set enrichment analysis suggested elevated expression of these hub genes in 
activated dendritic cells, neutrophils, activated CD4 memory T cells, and 
activated mast cells in HIRI samples versus controls. A ceRNA network 
underscored a complex regulatory interplay among genes. The genes mRNA and 
protein levels were also verified in HIRI-affected mouse liver tissues.
CONCLUSION: Our findings have provided a comprehensive understanding of the 
association between cuproptosis and HIRI, establishing a promising diagnostic 
pattern and identifying latent therapeutic targets for HIRI treatment. 
Additionally, our study offers novel insights to delve deeper into the 
underlying mechanisms of HIRI.

Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is still in need of effective treatments. 
This study applies a holistic approach to propose new targets for treatment of 
primary and liver metastatic CRC and investigates their therapeutic potential 
in-vitro. An integrative analysis of primary and metastatic CRC samples was 
implemented for alternative target and treatment proposals. Integrated 
microarray samples were grouped based on a co-expression network analysis. 
Significant gene modules correlated with primary CRC and metastatic phenotypes 
were identified. Network clustering and pathway enrichments were applied to gene 
modules to prioritize potential targets, which were shortlisted by independent 
validation. Finally, drug-target interaction search led to three agents for 
primary and liver metastatic CRC phenotypes. Hesperadin and BAY-1217389 suppress 
colony formation over a 14-day period, with Hesperadin showing additional 
efficacy in reducing cell viability within 48 h. As both candidates target the 
G2/M phase proteins NEK2 or TTK, we confirmed their anti-proliferative 
properties by Ki-67 staining. Hesperadinin particular arrested the cell cycle at 
the G2/M phase. IL-29A treatment reduced migration and invasion capacities of 
TGF-β induced metastatic cell lines. In addition, this anti-metastatic treatment 
attenuated TGF-β dependent mesenchymal transition. Network analysis suggests 
IL-29A induces the JAK/STAT pathway in a preventive manner.

Introduction: The escalating global surge in Rifampicin-resistant strains poses 
a formidable challenge to the worldwide campaign against tuberculosis (TB), 
particularly in developing countries. The frequent reports of suboptimal 
treatment outcomes, complications, and the absence of definitive treatment 
guidelines for Rifampicin-resistant spinal TB (DSTB) contribute significantly to 
the obstacles in its effective management. Consequently, there is an urgent need 
for innovative and efficacious drugs to address Rifampicin-resistant spinal 
tuberculosis, minimizing the duration of therapy sessions. This study aims to 
investigate potential targets for DSTB through comprehensive proteomic and 
pharmaco-transcriptomic analyses. Methods: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics 
analysis was employed to validate potential DSTB-related targets. PPI analysis 
confirmed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot analysis. Results: The 
proteomics analysis revealed 373 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), with 
137 upregulated and 236 downregulated proteins. Subsequent Gene Ontology (GO) 
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses delved into the 
DSTB-related pathways associated with these DEPs. In the context of network 
pharmacology analysis, five key targets-human leukocyte antigen A chain (HLAA), 
human leukocyte antigen C chain (HLA-C), HLA Class II Histocompatibility 
Antigen, DRB1 Beta Chain (HLA-DRB1), metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and 
Phospholipase C-like 1 (PLCL1)-were identified as pivotal players in pathways 
such as "Antigen processing and presentation" and "Phagosome," which are 
crucially enriched in DSTB. Moreover, pharmaco-transcriptomic analysis can 
confirm that 58 drug compounds can regulate the expression of the key targets. 
Discussion: This research confirms the presence of protein alterations during 
the Rifampicin-resistant process in DSTB patients, offering novel insights into 
the molecular mechanisms underpinning DSTB. The findings suggest a promising 
avenue for the development of targeted drugs to enhance the management of 
Rifampicin-resistant spinal tuberculosis.

Chromatin regulators are indispensable upstream epigenetic regulators.The 
emergence and progression of atherosclerosis has been demonstrated to be 
influenced by smooth muscle-related chromatin regulators, such as ZEB2 and MAFF. 
However, specific chromatin regulators and their possible roles have not been 
clarified. Information was gathered from 51 patients diagnosed with coronary 
artery disease (CAD) and 50 individuals in good health from the GEO database. 
440 genes were identified as having differential expression across the two 
datasets, and these genes were linked to cellular reactions. Enrichment of 
pathways related to histone modification and transcriptional regulatory factors 
was observed in GO and KEGG analyses. Four machine learning models (RF, SVM, 
GLM, and XGB) were developed using the expression profiles of 440 
chromatin-associated genes in the CAD cohort to pinpoint genes with significant 
diagnostic potential. After evaluating residuals, root mean square errors, 
receiver operating characteristic curves, and immune-infiltration, four key 
genes (HCFC1, RNF8, TNP1, and SET) were identified. Gene expression in different 
blood vessel levels in atherosclerotic plaques in a mouse model of coronary 
artery disease showed significant variations. The gene expression levels in 
macrophages aligned with clinical data from the GEO database as expected. This 
discovery is crucial for future analysis and the prediction of drug and miRNA 
targets. In conclusion, we found that the four hub genes are important in the 
mechanism of CAD. These findings provide new ideas for the study of potential 
epigenetic predictive markers and therapeutic targets to be used in determining 
a treatment strategy for CAD.

Oral poisoning can trigger diverse physiological reactions, determined by the 
toxic substance involved. One such consequence is hyperchloremia, characterized 
by an elevated level of chloride in the blood and leads to kidney damage and 
impairing chloride ion regulation. Here, we conducted a comprehensive 
genome-wide analysis to investigate genes or proteins linked to hyperchloremia. 
Our analysis included functional enrichment, protein-protein interactions, gene 
expression, exploration of molecular pathways, and the identification of 
potential shared genetic factors contributing to the development of 
hyperchloremia. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that oral poisoning 
owing hyperchloremia is associated with 4 proteins e.g. Kelch-like protein 3, 
Serine/threonine-protein kinase WNK4, Serine/threonine-protein kinase WNK1 and 
Cullin-3. The protein-protein interaction network revealed Cullin-3 as an 
exceptional protein, displaying a maximum connection of 18 nodes. Insufficient 
data from transcriptomic analysis indicates that there are lack of information 
having direct associations between these proteins and human-related functions to 
oral poisoning, hyperchloremia, or metabolic acidosis. The metabolic pathway of 
Cullin-3 protein revealed that the derivative is Sulfonamide which play role in, 
increasing urine output, and metabolic acidosis resulted in hypertension. Based 
on molecular docking results analysis it found that Cullin-3 proteins has the 
lowest binding energies score and being suitable proteins. Moreover, no major 
variations were observed in unbound Cullin-3 and all three peptide bound 
complexes shows that all systems remain compact during 50 ns simulations. The 
results of our study revealed Cullin-3 proteins be a strong foundation for the 
development of potential drug targets or biomarker for future studies.

Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and highly aggressive brain tumor 
with a poor prognosis for patients. It is urgently needed to identify potential 
small molecule drugs that specifically target key genes associated with GBM 
development and prognosis. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
between GBM and normal tissues were obtained by data mining the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Gene function 
annotation was performed to investigate the potential functions of the DEGs. A 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to explore hub genes 
associated with GBM. Bioinformatics analysis was used to screen the potential 
therapeutic and prognostic genes. Finally, potential small molecule drugs were 
predicted using the DGIdb database and verified using chemical informatics 
methods including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity 
(ADMET), and molecular docking studies. Results: A total of 429 DEGs were 
identified, of which 19 hub genes were obtained through PPI analysis. The hub 
genes were confirmed as potential therapeutic targets by functional enrichment 
and mRNA expression. Survival analysis and protein expression confirmed 
centromere protein A (CENPA) as a prognostic target in GBM. Four small molecule 
drugs were predicted for the treatment of GBM. Conclusion: Our study suggests 
some promising potential therapeutic targets and small molecule drugs for the 
treatment of GBM, providing new ideas for further research and targeted drug 
development.

Although papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has a good prognosis, its recurrence 
rate is high and remains a core concern in the clinic. Molecular factors 
contributing to different recurrence risks (RRs) remain poorly defined. Here, we 
perform an integrative proteogenomic and metabolomic characterization of 102 
Chinese PTC patients with different RRs. Genomic profiling reveals that 
mutations in MUC16 and TERT promoter as well as multiple gene fusions like 
NCOA4-RET are enriched by the high RR. Integrative multi-omics analyses further 
describe the multi-dimensional characteristics of PTC, especially in metabolism 
pathways, and delineate dominated molecular patterns of different RRs. Moreover, 
the PTC patients are clustered into four subtypes (CS1: low RR and BRAF-like; 
CS2: high RR and metabolism type, worst prognosis; CS3: high RR and immune type, 
better prognosis; CS4: high RR and BRAF-like) based on the omics data. Notably, 
the subtypes display significant differences considering BRAF and TERT promoter 
mutations, metabolism and immune pathway profiles, epithelial cell compositions, 
and various clinical factors (especially RRs and prognosis) as well as druggable 
targets. This study can provide insights into the complex molecular 
characteristics of PTC recurrences and help promote early diagnosis and 
precision treatment of recurrent PTC.

There is considerable comorbidity across externalizing and internalizing 
behavior dimensions of psychopathology. We applied genomic structural equation 
modeling (gSEM) to genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics to 
evaluate the factor structure of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology 
across 16 traits and disorders among European-ancestry individuals (n's = 16,400 
to 1,074,629). We conducted GWAS on factors derived from well-fitting models. 
Downstream analyses served to identify biological mechanisms, explore drug 
repurposing targets, estimate genetic overlap between the externalizing and 
internalizing spectra, and evaluate causal effects of psychopathology liability 
on physical health. Both a correlated factors model, comprising two factors of 
externalizing and internalizing risk, and a higher-order single-factor model of 
genetic effects contributing to both spectra demonstrated acceptable t. GWAS 
identified 409 lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
externalizing and 85 lead SNPs associated with internalizing, while the 
second-order GWAS identified 256 lead SNPs contributing to broad psychopathology 
risk. In bivariate causal mixture models, nearly all externalizing and 
internalizing causal variants overlapped, despite a genetic correlation of only 
0.37 (SE = 0.02) between them. Externalizing genes showed cell-type specific 
expression in GABAergic, cortical, and hippocampal neurons, and internalizing 
genes were associated with reduced subcallosal cortical volume, providing 
insight into the neurobiological underpinnings of psychopathology. Genetic 
liability for externalizing, internalizing, and broad psychopathology exerted 
causal effects on pain, general health, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic 
illnesses. These findings underscore the complex genetic architecture of 
psychopathology, identify potential biological pathways for the externalizing 
and internalizing spectra, and highlight the physical health burden of 
psychiatric comorbidity.

Leukemia can arise at various stages of the hematopoietic differentiation 
hierarchy, but the impact of developmental arrest on drug sensitivity is 
unclear. Applying network-based analyses to single-cell transcriptomes of human 
B cells, we define genome-wide signaling circuitry for each B cell 
differentiation stage. Using this reference, we comprehensively map the 
developmental states of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), revealing 
its strong correlation with sensitivity to asparaginase, a commonly used 
chemotherapeutic agent. Single-cell multi-omics analyses of primary B-ALL blasts 
reveal marked intra-leukemia heterogeneity in asparaginase response: resistance 
is linked to pre-pro-B-like cells, with sensitivity associated with the 
pro-B-like population. By targeting BCL2, a driver within the pre-pro-B-like 
cell signaling network, we find that venetoclax significantly potentiates 
asparaginase efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate a 
single-cell systems pharmacology framework to predict effective combination 
therapies based on intra-leukemia heterogeneity in developmental state, with 
potentially broad applications beyond B-ALL.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two 
widespread chronic disorders characterized by shared risk factors and molecular 
pathways. Glucose metabolism, pivotal for cellular homeostasis and energy 
supply, plays a critical role in these diseases. Its disturbance has been linked 
to the pathogenesis of both AD and T2DM. However, a comprehensive investigation 
into the specific roles of glucometabolic genes in the onset and progression of 
AD and T2DM has yet to be conducted.
METHODS: By analyzing microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
repository, we identified differentially expressed glucometabolic genes (DEGs) 
in AD and T2DM cohorts. A range of bioinformatics tools were employed for 
functional annotation, pathway enrichment, protein interaction network 
construction, module analysis, ROC curve assessment, correlation matrix 
construction, gene set enrichment analysis, and gene-drug interaction mapping of 
these DEGs. Key genes were further validated using quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in AD and T2DM murine models.
RESULTS: Our investigation identified 41 glucometabolic-related DEGs, with six 
prominent genes (G6PD, PKM, ENO3, PFKL, PGD, and TALDO1) being common in both AD 
and T2DM cohorts. These genes play crucial roles in metabolic pathways including 
glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and amino sugar metabolism. Their 
diagnostic potential was highlighted by area under curve (AUC) values exceeding 
0.6 for AD and 0.8 for T2DM. Further analysis explored the interactions, pathway 
enrichments, regulatory mechanisms, and potential drug interactions of these key 
genes. In the AD murine model, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) analysis revealed significant upregulation of G6pd, Eno3, and Taldo1. 
Similarly, in the T2DM murine model, elevated expression levels of G6pd, Pfkl, 
Eno3, and Pgd were observed.
CONCLUSION: Our rigorous research sheds light on the molecular interconnections 
between AD and T2DM from a glucometabolic perspective, revealing new 
opportunities for pharmacological innovation and therapeutic approaches. This 
study appears to be the first to extensively investigate 
glucometabolic-associated DEGs and key genes in both AD and T2DM, utilizing 
multiple datasets. These insights are set to enhance our understanding of the 
complex pathophysiology underlying these widespread chronic diseases.

The proteome holds great potential as an intermediate layer between the genome 
and phenome. Previous protein quantitative trait locus studies have focused 
mainly on describing the effects of common genetic variations on the proteome. 
Here, we assessed the impact of the common and rare genetic variations as well 
as the copy number variants (CNVs) on 326 plasma proteins measured in up to 500 
individuals. We identified 184 cis and 94 trans signals for 157 protein traits, 
which were further fine-mapped to credible sets for 101 cis and 87 trans signals 
for 151 proteins. Rare genetic variation contributed to the levels of 7 
proteins, with 5 cis and 14 trans associations. CNVs were associated with the 
levels of 11 proteins (7 cis and 5 trans), examples including a 3q12.1 deletion 
acting as a hub for multiple trans associations; and a CNV overlapping NAIP, a 
sensor component of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome which is affecting 
pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 18 levels. In summary, this work presents 
a comprehensive resource of genetic variation affecting the plasma protein 
levels and provides the interpretation of identified effects.

In the dynamic landscape of targeted therapeutics, drug discovery has pivoted 
towards understanding underlying disease mechanisms, placing a strong emphasis 
on molecular perturbations and target identification. This paradigm shift, 
crucial for drug discovery, is underpinned by big data, a transformative force 
in the current era. Omics data, characterized by its heterogeneity and enormity, 
has ushered biological and biomedical research into the big data domain. 
Acknowledging the significance of integrating diverse omics data strata, known 
as multi-omics studies, researchers delve into the intricate interrelationships 
among various omics layers. This review navigates the expansive omics landscape, 
showcasing tailored assays for each molecular layer through genomes to 
metabolomes. The sheer volume of data generated necessitates sophisticated 
informatics techniques, with machine-learning (ML) algorithms emerging as robust 
tools. These datasets not only refine disease classification but also enhance 
diagnostics and foster the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. 
Through the integration of high-throughput data, the review focuses on targeting 
and modeling multiple disease-regulated networks, validating interactions with 
multiple targets, and enhancing therapeutic potential using network pharmacology 
approaches. Ultimately, this exploration aims to illuminate the transformative 
impact of multi-omics in the big data era, shaping the future of biological 
research.

BACKGROUND: NSCLC is a lethal cancer that is highly prevalent and accounts for 
85% of cases of lung cancer. Conventional cancer treatments, such as 
chemotherapy and radiation, frequently exhibit limited efficacy and notable 
adverse reactions. Therefore, a drug repurposing method is proposed for 
effective NSCLC treatment.
AIMS: This study aims to evaluate candidate drugs that are effective for NSCLC 
at the clinical level using a systems biology and network analysis approach.
METHODS: Differentially expressed genes in transcriptomics data were identified 
using the systems biology and network analysis approaches. A network of gene 
co-expression was developed with the aim of detecting two modules of gene 
co-expression. Following that, the Drug-Gene Interaction Database was used to 
find possible drugs that target important genes within two gene co-expression 
modules linked to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The use of Cytoscape 
facilitated the creation of a drug-gene interaction network. Finally, gene set 
enrichment analysis was done to validate candidate drugs.
RESULTS: Unlike previous research on repositioning drugs for NSCLC, which uses a 
gene co-expression network, this project is the first to research both gene 
co-expression and co-occurrence networks. And the co-occurrence network also 
accounts for differentially expressed genes in cancer cells and their adjacent 
normal cells. For effective management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
drugs that show higher gene regulation and gene affinity within the drug-gene 
interaction network are thought to be important. According to the discourse, 
NSCLC genes have a lot of control over medicines like vincristine, fluorouracil, 
methotrexate, clotrimazole, etoposide, tamoxifen, sorafenib, doxorubicin, and 
pazopanib.
CONCLUSION: Hence, there is a possibility of repurposing these drugs for the 
treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.

Chronic pain is a common problem, with more than one-fifth of adult Americans 
reporting pain daily or on most days. It adversely affects the quality of life 
and imposes substantial personal and economic costs. Efforts to treat chronic 
pain using opioids had a central role in precipitating the opioid crisis. 
Despite an estimated heritability of 25-50%, the genetic architecture of chronic 
pain is not well-characterized, in part because studies have largely been 
limited to samples of European ancestry. To help address this knowledge gap, we 
conducted a cross-ancestry meta-analysis of pain intensity in 598,339 
participants in the Million Veteran Program, which identified 126 independent 
genetic loci, 69 of which are new. Pain intensity was genetically correlated 
with other pain phenotypes, level of substance use and substance use disorders, 
other psychiatric traits, education level and cognitive traits. Integration of 
the genome-wide association studies findings with functional genomics data shows 
enrichment for putatively causal genes (n = 142) and proteins (n = 14) expressed 
in brain tissues, specifically in GABAergic neurons. Drug repurposing analysis 
identified anticonvulsants, β-blockers and calcium-channel blockers, among other 
drug groups, as having potential analgesic effects. Our results provide insights 
into key molecular contributors to the experience of pain and highlight 
attractive drug targets.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated 76 loci with the risk of 
developing melanoma. However, understanding the molecular basis of such 
associations has remained a challenge because most of these loci are in 
non-coding regions of the genome. Here, we integrated data on epigenomic 
markers, three-dimensional (3D) genome organization, and expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTL) from melanoma-relevant tissues and cell types to gain novel 
insights into the mechanisms underlying melanoma risk. This integrative approach 
revealed a total of 151 target genes, both near and far away from the risk loci 
in linear sequence, with known and novel roles in the etiology of melanoma. 
Using protein-protein interaction networks, we identified proteins that 
interact-directly or indirectly-with the products of the target genes. The 
interacting proteins were enriched for known melanoma driver genes. Further 
integration of these target genes into tissue-specific gene regulatory networks 
revealed patterns of gene regulation that connect melanoma to its comorbidities. 
Our study provides novel insights into the biological implications of genetic 
variants associated with melanoma risk.

Vitiligo is a skin disease characterized by selective loss of melanocytes, which 
seriously affects the appearance and causes great psychological stress to 
patients. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of two vitiligo 
microarray datasets from the GEO database using bioinformatics tools to identify 
297 up-regulated mRNAs and 186 down-regulated mRNAs, revealing important roles 
for pathways related to melanin synthesis, tyrosine metabolism, and inflammatory 
factors, such as "PPAR signaling pathway", "tyrosine metabolism", "nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathway", "melanogenesis", and "IL-17 signaling 
pathway". Combining the Search Tool for Interacting Chemicals (STITCH) database 
5.0 and the drug-gene interaction database 3.0 (DGIdb), we identified that the 
PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone may promote melanin synthesis via EDNRB. Next, we 
investigated the mechanism of rosiglitazone and PPAR-γ pathway in promoting 
melanin production. Consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis, the 
expression levels of PPAR-γ, EDNRB, and TYR were significantly reduced in human 
non-segmental vitiligo skin along with the reduction of MITF, a key gene for 
epidermal melanogenesis. Meanwhile, rosiglitazone increased melanin synthesis 
capacity in melanocytes and zebrafish by activating PPAR-γ and upregulating TYR, 
TYRP-1, and TYRP-2. Conversely, treatment of melanocytes with the PPAR-γ 
antagonist GW resulted in inhibition of melanin synthesis and expression of 
melanin-related factors. At the same time, simultaneous treatment of 
rosiglitazone with GW reversed the inhibitory effect of GW on melanin synthesis. 
In this study, we identified that rosiglitazone, an important insulin 
sensitizer, promotes melanin synthesis in melanocytes by increasing PPAR-γ 
activity and upregulating the expression levels of EDNRB and TYR. These findings 
may provide new ideas for exploring the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic 
targets of non-segmental vitiligo.

Heterogeneous accumulation of senescent cells expressing the 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) affects tissue homeostasis 
which leads to diseases, such as osteoarthritis (OA). In this study, we set out 
to characterize heterogeneity of cellular senescence within aged articular 
cartilage and explored the presence of corresponding metabolic profiles in blood 
that could function as representative biomarkers. Hereto, we set out to perform 
cluster analyses, using a gene-set of 131 senescence genes (N = 57) in a 
previously established RNA sequencing dataset of aged articular cartilage and a 
generated metabolic dataset in overlapping blood samples. Using unsupervised 
hierarchical clustering and pathway analysis, we identified two robust cellular 
senescent endotypes. Endotype-1 was enriched for cell proliferating pathways, 
expressing forkhead box protein O4 (FOXO4), RB transcriptional corepressor like 
2 (RBL2), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B); the FOXO mediated 
cell cycle was identified as possible target for endotype-1 patients. Endotype-2 
showed enriched inflammation-associated pathways, expressed by interleukin 6 
(IL6), matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)1/3, and vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF)C and SASP pathways were identified as possible targets for endotype-2 
patients. Notably, plasma-based metabolic profiles in overlapping blood samples 
(N = 21) showed two corresponding metabolic clusters in blood. These 
non-invasive metabolic profiles could function as biomarkers for 
patient-tailored targeting of senescence in OA.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a life-threatening hematologic malignant disease 
with high morbidity and mortality in both adults and children. Cuproptosis, a 
novel mode of cell death, plays an important role in tumor development, but the 
functional mechanisms of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in AML are unclear. 
The differential expression of CRGs between tumors such as AML and normal 
tissues in UCSC XENA, TCGA and GTEx was verified using R (version: 3.6.3). Lasso 
regression, Cox regression and Nomogram were used to screen for prognostic 
biomarkers of AML and to construct corresponding prognostic models. Kaplan-Meier 
analysis, ROC analysis, clinical correlation analysis, immune infiltration 
analysis and enrichment analysis were used to further investigate the 
correlation and functional mechanisms of CRGs with AML. The ceRNA regulatory 
network was used to identify the mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA regulatory axis. 
Cuproptosis-related genes LIPT1, MTF1, GLS and CDKN2A were highly expressed in 
AML, while FDX1, LIAS, DLD, DLAT, PDHA1, SLC31A1 and ATP7B were lowly expressed 
in AML. Lasso regression, Cox regression, Nomogram and calibration curve finally 
identified MTF1 and LIPT1 as two novel prognostic biomarkers of AML and 
constructed the corresponding prognostic models. In addition, all 12 CRGs had 
predictive power for AML, with MTF1, LIAS, SLC31A1 and CDKN2A showing more 
reliable results. Further analysis showed that ATP7B was closely associated with 
mutation types such as FLT3, NPM1, RAS and IDH1 R140 in AML, while the 
expression of MTF1, LIAS and ATP7B in AML was closely associated with immune 
infiltration. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that biological functions such 
as metal ion transmembrane transporter activity, haptoglobin binding and oxygen 
carrier activity, pathways such as interferon alpha response, coagulation, UV 
response DN, apoptosis, hypoxia and heme metabolism all play a role in the 
development of AML. The ceRNA regulatory network revealed that 6 lncRNAs such as 
MALAT1, interfere with MTF1 expression through 6 miRNAs such as hsa-miR-32-5p, 
which in turn affect the development and progression of AML. In addition, 
APTO-253 has the potential to become an AML-targeted drug. The 
cuproptosis-related genes MTF1 and LIPT1 can be used as prognostic biomarkers in 
AML. A total of six lncRNAs, including MALAT1, are involved in the expression 
and regulation of MTF1 in AML through six miRNAs such as hsa-miR-32-5p.

Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are a class of activity-regulated genes (ARGs) that 
are transiently and rapidly activated in the absence of de novo protein 
synthesis in response to neuronal activity. We explored the role of IEGs in 
genetic networks to pinpoint potential drug targets for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Using a combination of network analysis and genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) summary statistics we show that (1) IEGs exert greater topological 
influence across different human and mouse gene networks compared to other ARGs, 
(2) ARGs are sparsely involved in diseases and significantly more mutational 
constrained compared to non-ARGs, (3) Many AD-linked variants are in ARGs gene 
regions, mainly in MARK4 near FOSB, with an AD risk eQTL that increases MARK4 
expression in cortical areas, (4) MARK4 holds an influential place in a dense AD 
multi-omic network and a high AD druggability score. Our work on IEGs' 
influential network role is a valuable contribution to guiding interventions for 
diseases marked by dysregulation of their downstream targets and highlights 
MARK4 as a promising underexplored AD-target.

Drug repurposing offers a viable strategy for discovering new drugs and 
therapeutic targets through the analysis of drug-gene interactions. However, 
traditional experimental methods are plagued by their costliness and 
inefficiency. Despite graph convolutional network (GCN)-based models' 
state-of-the-art performance in prediction, their reliance on supervised 
learning makes them vulnerable to data sparsity, a common challenge in drug 
discovery, further complicating model development. In this study, we propose 
SGCLDGA, a novel computational model leveraging graph neural networks and 
contrastive learning to predict unknown drug-gene associations. SGCLDGA employs 
GCNs to extract vector representations of drugs and genes from the original 
bipartite graph. Subsequently, singular value decomposition (SVD) is employed to 
enhance the graph and generate multiple views. The model performs contrastive 
learning across these views, optimizing vector representations through a 
contrastive loss function to better distinguish positive and negative samples. 
The final step involves utilizing inner product calculations to determine 
association scores between drugs and genes. Experimental results on the DGIdb4.0 
dataset demonstrate SGCLDGA's superior performance compared with six 
state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies and case analyses validate the 
significance of contrastive learning and SVD, highlighting SGCLDGA's potential 
in discovering new drug-gene associations. The code and dataset for SGCLDGA are

INTRODUCTION: Like other forms of neuropathology, gliomas appear to spread along 
neural pathways. Accordingly, our group and others have previously shown that 
brain network connectivity is highly predictive of glioma survival. In this 
study, we aimed to examine the molecular mechanisms of this relationship via 
imaging transcriptomics.
METHODS: We retrospectively obtained presurgical, T1-weighted MRI datasets from 
669 adult patients, newly diagnosed with diffuse glioma. We measured brain 
connectivity using gray matter networks and coregistered these data with a 
transcriptomic brain atlas to determine the spatial co-localization between 
brain connectivity and expression patterns for 14 proto-oncogenes and 3 neural 
network construction genes.
RESULTS: We found that all 17 genes were significantly co-localized with brain 
connectivity (p < 0.03, corrected). The strength of co-localization was highly 
predictive of overall survival in a cross-validated Cox Proportional Hazards 
model (mean area under the curve, AUC = 0.68 +/- 0.01) and significantly 
(p < 0.001) more so for a random forest survival model (mean AUC = 0.97 +/- 
0.06). Bayesian network analysis demonstrated direct and indirect causal 
relationships among gene-brain co-localizations and survival. Gene ontology 
analysis showed that metabolic processes were overexpressed when spatial 
co-localization between brain connectivity and gene transcription was highest 
(p < 0.001). Drug-gene interaction analysis identified 84 potential candidate 
therapies based on our findings.
DISCUSSION: Our findings provide novel insights regarding how gene-brain 
connectivity interactions may affect glioma survival.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers for the diagnosis 
and treatment of osteoporosis (OP).
METHODS: Data sets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, 
and differentially programmed cell death-related genes were screened. Functional 
analyses were performed to predict the biological processes associated with 
these genes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support 
vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) machine learning algorithms were 
used to screen for characteristic genes, and receiver operating characteristics 
were used to evaluate the diagnosis of disease characteristic gene values. Gene 
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and single-sample GSEA were conducted to analyze 
the correlation between characteristic genes and immune infiltrates. Cytoscape 
and the Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) were used to construct the 
mitochondrial RNA-mRNA-transcription factor network and explore small-molecule 
drugs. Reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis was 
performed to evaluate the expression of biomarker genes in clinical samples.
RESULTS: In total, 25 differential cell death genes were identified. Among 
these, two genes were screened using the LASSO, SVM, and RF algorithms as 
characteristic genes, including BRSK2 and VPS35. In GSE56815, the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of BRSK2 was 0.761 and that of VPS35 was 
0.789. In addition, immune cell infiltration analysis showed that BRSK2 
positively correlated with CD56dim natural killer cells and negatively 
correlated with central memory CD4 + T cells. Based on the data from DGIdb, 
hesperadin was associated with BRSK2, and melagatran was associated with VPS35. 
BRSK2 and VPS35 were expectably upregulated in OP group compared with controls 
(all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: BRSK2 and VPS35 may be important diagnostic biomarkers of OP.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) are considered to be two 
separate pancreatic diseases in most studies, but some clinical retrospective 
analyses in recent years have found some degree of correlation between the two 
in actual treatment, however, the exact association is not clear. In this study, 
bioinformatics analysis was utilized to examine microarray sequencing data in 
mice, with the aim of elucidating the critical signaling pathways and genes 
involved in the progression from AP to CP. Differential gene expression analyses 
on murine transcriptomes were conducted using the R programming language and the 
R/Bioconductor package. Additionally, gene network analysis was performed using 
the STRING database to predict correlations among genes in the context of 
pancreatic diseases. Functional enrichment and gene ontology pathways common to 
both diseases were identified using Metascape. The hub genes were screened in 
the cytoscape algorithm, and the mRNA levels of the hub genes were verified in 
mice pancreatic tissues of AP and CP. Then the drugs corresponding to the hub 
genes were obtained in the drug-gene relationship. A set of hub genes, including 
Jun, Cd44, Epcam, Spp1, Anxa2, Hsp90aa1, and Cd9, were identified through 
analysis, demonstrating their pivotal roles in the progression from AP to CP. 
Notably, these genes were found to be enriched in the Helper T-cell factor 
(Th17) signaling pathway. Up-regulation of these genes in both AP and CP mouse 
models was validated through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) results. The significance of the Th17 signaling pathway in the 
transition from AP to CP was underscored by our findings. Specifically, the 
essential genes driving this progression were identified as Jun, Cd44, Epcam, 
Spp1, Anxa2, Hsp90aa1, and Cd9. Crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms 
underlying pancreatitis progression were provided by this research, offering 
promising avenues for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.

Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) is a malignant tumor that carries a 
substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. The MMP family assumes a crucial 
role in tumor invasion and metastasis. This study aimed to uncover the 
mechanistic relevance of the MMP gene family as a therapeutic target and 
diagnostic biomarker in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) through a 
comprehensive approach encompassing both computational and molecular analyses. 
STRING, Cytoscape, UALCAN, GEPIA, OncoDB, HPA, cBioPortal, GSEA, TIMER, ENCORI, 
DrugBank, targeted bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite-seq), conventional PCR, 
Sanger sequencing, and RT-qPCR based analyses were used in the present study to 
analyze MMP gene family members to accurately determine a few hub genes that can 
be utilized as both therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers for KIRC. By 
performing STRING and Cytohubba analyses of the 24 MMP gene family members, MMP2 
(matrix metallopeptidase 2), MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), MMP12 (matrix 
metallopeptidase 12), and MMP16 (matrix metallopeptidase 16) genes were denoted 
as hub genes having highest degree scores. After analyzing MMP2, MMP9, MMP12, 
and MMP16 via various TCGA databases and RT-qPCR technique across clinical 
samples and KIRC cell lines, interestingly, all these hub genes were found 
significantly overexpressed at mRNA and protein levels in KIRC samples relative 
to controls. The notable effect of the up-regulated MMP2, MMP9, MMP12, and MMP16 
was also documented on the overall survival (OS) of the KIRC patients. Moreover, 
targeted bisulfite-sequencing (bisulfite-seq) analysis revealed that promoter 
hypomethylation pattern was associated with up-regulation of hub genes (MMP2, 
MMP9, MMP12, and MMP16). In addition to this, hub genes were involved in various 
diverse oncogenic pathways. The MMP gene family members (MMP2, MMP9, MMP12, and 
MMP16) may serve as therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers in KIRC.

BACKGROUND: Ineffective drug treatment is a major problem for many patients with 
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Important reasons are the lack of 
systematic solutions for drug prioritisation and repurposing based on 
characterisation of the complex and heterogeneous cellular and molecular changes 
in IMIDs.
METHODS: Here, we propose a computational framework, scDrugPrio, which 
constructs network models of inflammatory disease based on single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scDrugPrio constructs detailed network models of 
inflammatory diseases that integrate information on cell type-specific 
expression changes, altered cellular crosstalk and pharmacological properties 
for the selection and ranking of thousands of drugs.
RESULTS: scDrugPrio was developed using a mouse model of antigen-induced 
arthritis and validated by improved precision/recall for approved drugs, as well 
as extensive in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies of drugs that were 
predicted, but not approved, for the studied diseases. Next, scDrugPrio was 
applied to multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, and psoriatic arthritis, further 
supporting scDrugPrio through prioritisation of relevant and approved drugs. 
However, in contrast to the mouse model of arthritis, great interindividual 
cellular and gene expression differences were found in patients with the same 
diagnosis. Such differences could explain why some patients did or did not 
respond to treatment. This explanation was supported by the application of 
scDrugPrio to scRNA-seq data from eleven individual Crohn's disease patients. 
The analysis showed great variations in drug predictions between patients, for 
example, assigning a high rank to anti-TNF treatment in a responder and a low 
rank in a nonresponder to that treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a computational framework, scDrugPrio, for drug 
prioritisation based on scRNA-seq of IMID disease. Application to individual 
patients indicates scDrugPrio's potential for personalised network-based drug 
screening on cellulome-, genome-, and drugome-wide scales. For this purpose, we 
made scDrugPrio into an easy-to-use R package ( 
https://github.com/SDTC-CPMed/scDrugPrio ).

There is currently no medical therapy to prevent calcific aortic valve stenosis 
(CAVS). Multi-omics approaches could lead to the identification of novel 
molecular targets. Here, we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
meta-analysis including 14,819 cases among 941,863 participants of European 
ancestry. We report 32 genomic loci, among which 20 are novel. RNA sequencing of 
500 human aortic valves highlights an enrichment in expression regulation at 
these loci and prioritizes candidate causal genes. Homozygous genotype for a 
risk variant near TWIST1, a gene involved in endothelial-mesenchymal transition, 
has a profound impact on aortic valve transcriptomics. We identify five genes 
outside of GWAS loci by combining a transcriptome-wide association study, 
colocalization, and Mendelian randomization analyses. Using cross-phenotype and 
phenome-wide approaches, we highlight the role of circulating lipoproteins, 
blood pressure and inflammation in the disease process. Our findings pave the 
way for the development of novel therapies for CAVS.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is an important pathological basis 
for the development of degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine. Most clinical 
patients have low back pain as their main symptom. The deterioration of the 
biomechanical environment is an important cause of LDD. Although there is a 
large amount of basic research on LDD, there are fewer reports that correlate 
biomechanical mechanisms with basic research. Our research aims to identify 304 
key genes involved in LDD due to biomechanical deterioration, using a 
bioinformatics approach. We focus on SMAD3, CAV1, SMAD7, TGFB1 as hub genes, and 
screen for 30 potential target drugs, offering novel insights into LDD pathology 
and treatment options.
METHODS: The Gene Cards, GenCLip3, OMIM and Drugbank databases were explored to 
obtain genes associated with biomechanics and LDD, followed by making veen plots 
to obtain both co-expressed genes. GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway 
analysis of the co-expressed genes were obtained using the DAVID online platform 
and visualised via a free online website. Protein interaction networks (PPI) 
were obtained through the STRING platform and visualised through Cytoscape 
3.9.0. These genes were predicted for downstream interaction networks using the 
STITCH platform. Then, the GSE56081 dataset was used to validate the key genes. 
RT-PCR was used to detect mRNA expression of core genes in the degenerated 
nucleus pulposus (NP) samples and western bolt was used for protein expression. 
Lastly, the obtained hub genes were searched in the drug database (DGIdb) to 
find relevant drug candidates.
RESULTS: From the perspective of biomechanics-induced LDD, we obtained a total 
of 304 genes, the GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis 
showed that the functions of these genes are mostly related to inflammation and 
apoptosis. The PPI network was constructed and four Hub genes were obtained 
through the plug-in of Cytoscape software, namely SMAD3, CAV1, SMAD7 and TGFB1. 
The analysis of key genes revealed that biomechanical involvement in LDD may be 
related to the TGF-β signaling pathway. Validation of the GSE56081 dataset 
revealed that SMAD3 and TGFB1 were highly expressed in degenerating NP samples. 
RT-PCR results showed that the mRNA expression of SMAD3 and TGFB1 was 
significantly increased in the severe degeneration group; Western blot results 
also showed that the protein expression of TGFB1 and P-SMAD3 was significantly 
increased. In addition, we identified 30 potential drugs.
CONCLUSION: This study presented a new approach to investigate the correlation 
between biomechanical mechanisms and LDD. The deterioration of the biomechanical 
environment may cause LDD through the TGF-β signaling pathway. TGFB1 and SMAD3 
are important core targets. The important genes, pathways and drugs obtained in 
this study provided a new basis and direction for the study, diagnosis and 
treatment of LDD.

BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is widely recognized as a significant 
contributor to heart failure. Nevertheless, the absence of pharmaceutical 
interventions capable of reversing disease progression and improving prognosis 
underscores the imperative for additional research in this area.
METHODS: First, we identified and evaluated three gene sets, namely "SC-DCM", 
"EP-DCM" and "Drug", using big data and multiple bioinformatics analysis 
methods. Accordingly, drug-treatable ("Hub") genes in DCM were identified. 
Following this, four microarray expression profile datasets were employed to 
authenticate the expression levels and discriminatory efficacy of "Hub" genes. 
Additionally, mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to ascertain the 
causal association between the "Hub genes" and heart failure. Finally, the 
"DGIdb" was applied to identify "Hub" genes-targeted drugs. The "ssGSEA" 
algorithm assessed the level of immune cell infiltration in DCM.
RESULTS: Enrichment analysis showed that the "SC-DCM" and "EP-DCM" gene sets 
were closely associated with DCM. PIK3R1 and ERBB2 were identified as 
drug-treatable genes in DCM. Additional analysis using MR supported a causal 
relationship between ERBB2 and heart failure, but not PIK3R1. Moreover, PIK3R1 
was positively correlated with immune activation, while ERBB2 was negatively 
correlated. We found that everolimus was a pharmacological inhibitor for both 
PIK3R1 and ERBB2. However, no pharmacological agonist was found for ERBB2.
CONCLUSION: PIK3R1 and ERBB2 are drug-treatable genes in DCM. ERBB2 has a causal 
effect on heart failure, and its normal expression may play a role in preventing 
the progression of DCM to heart failure. In addition, there is a 
cross-expression of PIK3R1 and ERBB2 genes in both DCM and tumors. The adaptive 
immune system and PIK3R1 may be involved in DCM disease progression, while ERBB2 
exerts a protective effect against DCM.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) regulates many physiological processes by acting as 
competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA). The dysregulation of lncRNA X-inactive 
specific transcript (XIST) has been shown in various human disorders. However, 
its role in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is yet to be 
explored. This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of XIST in the 
pathogenesis of PCOS, specifically through dataset functional analysis. GEO PCOS 
datasets including RNA-seq, microarray, and miRNA-seq in granulosa cells (GCs) 
and blood, were examined and comprehensively analyzed. Enrichment analysis, ROC 
curve constructions, lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network analyses, and qRT-PCR 
validation were performed followed by a series of drug signature screenings. Our 
results revealed significant dysregulation in the expression of 1131 mRNAs, 30 
miRNAs, and XIST in GCs of PCOS patients compared to healthy individuals. Of 
the120 XIST-correlated upregulated genes, 25 were enriched in 
inflammation-related pathways. Additionally, 5 miRNAs were identified as 
negative regulators of XIST-correlated genes. Accordingly, a ceRNA network 
containing XIST-miRNAs-mRNAs interactions was constructed. Furthermore, 6 genes, 
including AQP9, ETS2, PLAU, PLEK, SOCS3, and TNFRSF1B served as both GCs and 
blood-based biomarkers. By analyzing the number of interactions among XIST, 
miRNAs, and mRNAs, we pinpointed ETS2 as the pivotal gene within the ceRNA 
network. Our findings reveal a novel XIST- hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-144-3p, and 
hsa-miR-1271-5p-ETS2 axis that comprehensively elucidates the XIST-associated 
mechanism underlying PCOS onset. qRT-PCR analysis further confirmed the, 
overexpression of both XIST and ETS2 . Furthermore, our results demonstrated 
that XIST and ETS2 were correlated with some assisted reproductive technologies 
outcomes. Finally, we identified two novel compounds including, 
methotrexate/folate and threonine using drug-gene interaction databases for PCOS 
management. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular etiology, 
diagnosis, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCOS.

Elucidating the pathobiological mechanisms underlying post-acute pulmonary 
sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential for early interventions and 
patient stratification. Here, we investigated the potential of microRNAs 
(miRNAs) as theranostic agents for pulmoprotection in critical illness 
survivors. Multicenter study including 172 ICU survivors. Diffusion impairment 
was defined as a lung-diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) <80% within 
12 months postdischarge. A disease-associated 16-miRNA panel was quantified in 
plasma samples collected at ICU admission. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted 
using KEGG, Reactome, GTEx, and Drug-Gene Interaction databases. The results 
were validated using an external RNA-seq dataset. A 3-miRNA signature linked to 
diffusion impairment (miR-27a-3p, miR-93-5p, and miR-199a-5p) was identified 
using random forest. Levels of miR-93-5p and miR-199a-5p were independently 
associated with the outcome, improving patient classification provided by the 
electronic health record. The experimentally validated targets of these miRNAs 
exhibited enrichment across diverse pathways, with telomere length 
quantification in an additional set of samples (n = 83) supporting the role of 
cell senescence in sequelae. Analysis of an external dataset refined the 
pathobiological fingerprint of pulmonary sequelae. Gene-drug interaction 
analysis revealed four FDA-approved drugs. Overall, this study advances our 
understanding of lung recovery in postacute respiratory infections, highlighting 
the potential of miRNAs and their targets for pulmoprotection.

PURPOSE: Leukemias have been associated with oral manifestations, reflecting 
susceptibility to cancer therapy-induced oral mucositis. We sought to identify 
SNPs associated with both leukemia and oral mucositis (OM).
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing was performed on leukemia and non-cancer blood 
disorder (ncBD) patients' saliva samples (N = 50) prior to conditioning therapy. 
WHO OM grading scores were determined: moderate to severe (OM2-4) vs. none to 
mild (OM0-1). Reads were processed using Trim Galorev0.6.7, Bowtie2v2.4.1, 
Samtoolsv1.10, Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)v4.2.6.1, and DeepVariantv1.4.0. We 
utilized the following pipelines: P1 analysis with PLINK2v3.7, SNP2GENEv1.4.1 
and MAGMAv1.07b, and P2 [leukemia (N = 42) vs. ncBDs (N = 8)] and P3 
[leukemia + OM2-4 (N = 18) vs. leukemia + OM0-1 (N = 24)] with Z-tests of 
genotypes and protein-protein interaction determination. GeneCardsSuitev5.14 was 
used to identify phenotypes (P1 and P2, leukemia; P3, oral mucositis) and 
average disease-causing likelihood and DGIdb for drug interactions. P1 and P2 
genes were analyzed with CytoScape plugin BiNGOv3.0.3 to retrieve 
overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Ensembl's VEP for SNP outcomes.
RESULTS: In P1, 457 candidate SNPs (28 genes) were identified and 21,604 SNPs 
(1016 genes) by MAGMAv1.07b. Eighteen genes were associated with "leukemia" per 
VarElectv5.14 analysis and predicted to be deleterious. In P2 and P3, 353 and 
174 SNPs were significant, respectively. STRINGv12.0 returned 77 and 32 genes 
(C.L. = 0.7) for P2 and P3, respectively. VarElectv5.14 determined 60 genes from 
P2 associated with "leukemia" and 11 with "oral mucositis" from P3. 
Overrepresented GO terms included "cellular process," "signaling," 
"hemopoiesis," and "regulation of immune response."
CONCLUSIONS: We identified candidate SNPs possibly conferring susceptibility to 
develop leukemia and oral mucositis.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are 
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms linking 
these two diseases remain unclear.
METHODS: To identify shared core genes between CD and RA, we employed 
differential gene analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) algorithm. Functional annotation of these core biomarkers was 
performed using consensus clustering and gene set enrichment analysis. We also 
constructed a protein-protein network and a miRNA-mRNA network using multiple 
databases, and potential therapeutic agents targeting the core biomarkers were 
predicted. Finally, we confirmed the expression of the genes in the biomarker 
panel in both CD and RA using quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: A total of five shared core genes, namely C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 
10 (CXCL10), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), aquaporin 9 (AQP9), 
secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), and metallothionein 1M (MT1M), were identified 
as core biomarkers. These biomarkers activate classical pro-inflammatory and 
immune signaling pathways, influencing immune cell aggregation. Additionally, 
testosterone was identified as a potential therapeutic agent targeting the 
biomarkers identified in this study. The expression of genes in the biomarker 
panel in CD and RA was confirmed through quantitative PCR.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed some core genes shared between CD and RA and 
established a novel biomarker panel with potential implications for the 
diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.

BACKGROUND: Identifying effective pharmacological interventions to prevent the 
progressive enlargement and rupture of aortic aneurysms (AAs) is critical. 
Previous studies have suggested links between metformin use and a decreased 
incidence of AAs. In this study, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to 
investigate causal effects of metformin's targets on AA risk and to explore the 
underlying mechanisms underlying these effects.
METHODS: To examine the relationship between metformin use and AA risk, we 
implemented both two-sample MR and multivariable MR analyses. Utilizing genetic 
instrumental variables, we retrieved cis-expression quantitative trait loci 
(cis-eQTL) data for potential targets of metformin from the Expression 
Quantitative Trait Loci Genetics Consortium (eQTLGen) Consortium and 
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Colocalization analysis was employed 
to ascertain the probability of shared causal genetic variants between single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with eQTLs and AA.
RESULTS: Our findings reveal that metformin use reduces AA risk, exhibiting a 
protective effect with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.88  ×  10-3 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 7.30  ×  10-5 -0.33, p = 0.01). Furthermore, the protective 
effect of type 2 diabetes on AA risk appears to be driven by metformin use ( 
ORMVMR = 1.34  ×  10-4 , 95% CI: 3.97  ×  10-8 -0.45, p = 0.03). Significant 
Mendelian randomization (MR) results were observed for the expression of two 
metformin-related genes in the bloodstream: NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase 
subunit A6 (NDUFA6) and cytochrome b5 type B (CYB5B), across two independent 
datasets ( ORCYB5B = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.20-1.51, p = 2.41  ×  10-7 ; ORNDUFA6 = 
1.12; 95% CI: 1.07-1.17, p = 1.69  ×  10-6 ). The MR analysis of tissue-specific 
expression also demonstrated a positive correlation between increased NDUFA6 
expression and heightened AA risk. Lastly, NDUFA6 exhibited evidence of 
colocalization with AA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that metformin may play a significant role in 
lowering the risk of AA. This protective effect could potentially be linked to 
the mitigation of mitochondrial and immune dysfunction. Overall, NDUFA6 has 
emerged as a potential mechanism through which metformin intervention may confer 
AA protection.

Earlier diagnosis of lung cancer is crucial for reducing mortality and morbidity 
in high-risk patients. Liquid biopsy is a critical technique for detecting the 
cancer earlier and tracking the treatment outcomes. However, noninvasive 
biomarkers are desperately needed due to the lack of therapeutic sensitivity and 
early-stage diagnosis. Therefore, we have utilized transcriptomic profiling of 
early-stage lung cancer patients to discover promising biomarkers and their 
associated metabolic functions. Initially, PCA highlights the diversity level of 
gene expression in three stages of lung cancer samples. We have identified two 
major clusters consisting of highly variant genes among the three stages. 
Further, a total of 7742, 6611, and 643 genes were identified as DGE for stages 
I-III respectively. Topological analysis of the protein-protein interaction 
network resulted in seven candidate biomarkers such as JUN, LYN, PTK2, UBC, 
HSP90AA1, TP53, and UBB cumulatively for the three stages of lung cancers. Gene 
enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses aid in the comprehension of pathway 
mechanisms and regulation of identified hub genes in lung cancer. Importantly, 
the medial survival rates up to ~ 70 months were identified for hub genes during 
the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Moreover, the hub genes displayed the 
significance of risk factors during gene expression analysis using TIMER2.0 
analysis. Therefore, we have reason that these biomarkers may serve as a 
prospective targeting candidate with higher treatment efficacy in early-stage 
lung cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease, 
whose development is associated with immune cells and persistent inflammation. 
Exploring the biomarkers of RA holds immense significance in terms of the 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of RA.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RA patients 
and the control group were screened by limma package. Through DEGs intersection 
overlapping 200 inflammatory response-related genes and 2498 immune-related 
genes, differentially expressed immune and inflammation-related genes (DE-IIRGs) 
were identified. Lasso regression analysis screened RA diagnostic biomarkers and 
constructed PPI networks. Finally, immune infiltration analysis and drug 
prediction were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 20 DE-IIRGs were identified by overlapping DEGs with 2498 
immune-related genes and 200 inflammatory response-related genes. These DE-IIRGs 
were primarily enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and other 
biological processes, and then five biomarker genes (TNFSF10, IL1R1, CXCL9, 
ACVR1B, and IL15) were identified. It was found that the expression levels of 
CXCL9, IL15, and TNFSF10 in the disease samples were significantly higher than 
those in the control group. These biomarker genes have more effective diagnostic 
potential. The RA samples exhibited significantly higher levels of cell 
infiltration compared to the control samples. hsa-miR-199a-5p's connections to 
the ACVR1B and CCR7 genes were identified by creating ceRNA networks from 20 
screened DE-IIRGs. There was a connection between CCL5 and AEMA4D and 
hsa-miR-214-3p.
CONCLUSION: We identified immune- and inflammation-related biomarkers in RA 
based on bioinformatics analysis and screened TNFSF10, IL1R1, CXCL9, ACVR1B, and 
IL15 as diagnostic markers for RA. Key Points • TNFSF10, IL1R1, CXCL9, ACVR1B, 
and IL15 may be new diagnostic biomarkers for RA. • These findings may provide a 
theoretical basis for early RA diagnosis.

Human organoids recapitulate the cell type diversity and function of their 
primary organs holding tremendous potentials for basic and translational 
research. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology and 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) have accelerated the biological and 
therapeutic interpretation of trait-relevant cell types or states. Here, we 
constructed a computational framework to integrate atlas-level organoid 
scRNA-seq data, GWAS summary statistics, expression quantitative trait loci, and 
gene-drug interaction data for distinguishing critical cell populations and drug 
targets relevant to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. We found that 
39 cell types across eight kinds of organoids were significantly associated with 
COVID-19 outcomes. Notably, subset of lung mesenchymal stem cells increased 
proximity with fibroblasts predisposed to repair COVID-19-damaged lung tissue. 
Brain endothelial cell subset exhibited significant associations with severe 
COVID-19, and this cell subset showed a notable increase in cell-to-cell 
interactions with other brain cell types, including microglia. We repurposed 33 
druggable genes, including IFNAR2, TYK2, and VIPR2, and their interacting drugs 
for COVID-19 in a cell-type-specific manner. Overall, our results showcase that 
host genetic determinants have cellular-specific contribution to COVID-19 
severity, and identification of cell type-specific drug targets may facilitate 
to develop effective therapeutics for treating severe COVID-19 and its 
complications.

BACKGROUND: The immune microenvironment and hypoxia play crucial roles in the 
pathophysiology of ischemic stroke (IS). Hence, in this study, we aimed to 
identify hypoxia- and immune-related biomarkers in IS.
METHODS: The IS microarray dataset GSE16561 was examined to determine 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) utilizing bioinformatics-based analysis. 
The intersection of hypoxia-related genes and DEGs was conducted to identify 
differentially expressed hypoxia-related genes (DEHRGs). Then, using weighted 
correlation network analysis (WGCNA), all of the genes in GSE16561 dataset were 
examined to create a co-expression network, and module-clinical trait 
correlations were examined for the purpose of examining the genes linked to 
immune cells. The immune-related DEHRGs were submitted to gene ontology (GO) and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. A 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by Cytoscape plugin 
MCODE, in order to extract hub genes. The miRNet was used to predict hub 
gene-related transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs. Finally, a diagnostic model 
was developed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: Between the control and IS samples, 4171 DEGs were found. Thereafter, 
the intersection of hypoxia-related genes and DEGs was conducted to obtain 45 
DEHRGs. Ten significantly differentially infiltrated immune cells were 
found-namely, CD56dim natural killer cells, activated CD8 T cells, activated 
dendritic cells, activated B cells, central memory CD8 T cells, effector memory 
CD8 T cells, natural killer cells, gamma delta T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic 
cells, and neutrophils-between IS and control samples. Subsequently, we 
identified 27 immune-related DEHRGs through the intersection of DEHRGs and genes 
in important modules of WGCNA. The immune-related DEHRGs were primarily enriched 
in response to hypoxia, cellular polysaccharide metabolic process, response to 
decreased oxygen levels, polysaccharide metabolic process, lipid and 
atherosclerosis, and HIF-1 signaling pathway H. Using MCODE, FOS, DDIT3, DUSP1, 
and NFIL3 were found to be hub genes. In the validation cohort and training set, 
the AUC values of the diagnostic model were 0.9188034 and 0.9395085, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: In brief, we identified and validated four hub genes-FOS, DDIT3, 
DUSP1, and NFIL3-which might be involved in the pathological development of IS, 
potentially providing novel perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of IS.

This paper aims to elucidate the differentially coexpressed genes, their 
potential mechanisms, and possible drug targets in low-grade invasive serous 
ovarian carcinoma (LGSC) in terms of the biologic continuity of normal, 
borderline, and malignant LGSC. We performed a bioinformatics analysis, 
integrating datasets generated using the GPL570 platform from different studies 
from the GEO database to identify changes in this transition, gene expression, 
drug targets, and their relationships with tumor microenvironmental 
characteristics. In the transition from ovarian epithelial cells to the serous 
borderline, the FGFR3 gene in the "Estrogen Response Late" pathway, the ITGB2 
gene in the "Cell Adhesion Molecule", the CD74 gene in the "Regulation of Cell 
Migration", and the IGF1 gene in the "Xenobiotic Metabolism" pathway were 
upregulated in the transition from borderline to LGSC. The ERBB4 gene in 
"Proteoglycan in Cancer", the AR gene in "Pathways in Cancer" and "Estrogen 
Response Early" pathways, were upregulated in the transition from ovarian 
epithelial cells to LGSC. In addition, SPP1 and ITGB2 genes were correlated with 
macrophage infiltration in the LGSC group. This research provides a valuable 
framework for the development of personalized therapeutic approaches in the 
context of LGSC, with the aim of improving patient outcomes and quality of life. 
Furthermore, the main goal of the current study is a preliminary study designed 
to generate in silico inferences, and it is also important to note that 
subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies will be necessary to confirm the results 
before considering these results as fully reliable.

Nearly two hundred common-variant depression risk loci have been identified by 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the impact of rare coding 
variants on depression remains poorly understood. Here, we present whole-exome 
sequencing analyses of depression with seven different definitions based on 
survey, questionnaire, and electronic health records in 320,356 UK Biobank 
participants. We showed that the burden of rare damaging coding variants in 
loss-of-function intolerant genes is significantly associated with risk of 
depression with various definitions. We compared the rare and common genetic 
architecture across depression definitions by genetic correlation and showed 
different genetic relationships between definitions across common and rare 
variants. In addition, we demonstrated that the effects of rare damaging coding 
variant burden and polygenic risk score on depression risk are additive. The 
gene set burden analyses revealed overlapping rare genetic variant components 
with developmental disorder, autism, and schizophrenia. Our study provides 
insights into the contribution of rare coding variants, separately and in 
conjunction with common variants, on depression with various definitions and 
their genetic relationships with neurodevelopmental disorders.

This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the aging of 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Gene expression profile GSE32719 was downloaded 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 14 young, 5 middle, and 8 
old HSCs. Differential expression analysis, short time-series expression miner 
analysis, and weighted co-expression network analysis were conducted to screen 
for hub genes whose expression changed over time during HSC aging. Subsequently, 
functional enrichment and multiple regulatory network analyses of the hub genes 
were performed. A total of 124 intersecting time-dependent differentially 
expressed and module genes were obtained, which were considered hub genes whose 
expression changed over time during HSC aging. Hub genes were significantly 
enriched in pathways such as the Hippo and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
signaling pathways. Moreover, AP-1 Transcription Factor Subunit (FOS) and 
sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) had higher degrees in the protein-protein interaction network, 
were regulated by more transcription factors (TFs), such as Sp1 transcription 
factor (SP1) and BRCA1 DNA repair-associated (BRCA1), in the TF-mRNA-miRNA 
network, were associated with more diseases in the disease-gene network, and 
could be targeted by more drugs in the drug-gene network. Furthermore, SIRT1 was 
targeted by miR-9-5p in the TF-mRNA-miRNA network. Hub genes such as FOS and 
SIRT1 and key pathways such as the Hippo and AMPK signaling pathways may play 
crucial roles in HSC aging. Moreover, FOS and SIRT1 were regulated by SP1 and 
BRCA1, respectively, during HSC aging. Furthermore, miR-9-5p may modulate HSC 
aging by targeting SIRT1. Thus, FOS and SIRT1 may be potential therapeutic 
targets for age-related hematopoietic dysfunction.

Background Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) poses clinical challenges with its 
unique histology and potential for perineural invasion, recurrence, and distant 
metastases. Recent genomic advancements have unveiled key genetic alterations in 
ACC, offering insights into its pathogenesis. Aim This study aims to unravel the 
intricate molecular landscape of ACC through a comprehensive analysis of gene 
expression patterns. By integrating data from multiple microarray datasets, the 
study explores differentially expressed genes (DEGs), their functional 
enrichment, protein-protein interactions (PPI), hub genes, microRNA (miRNA) 
involvement, transcription factors, and potential drug-gene interactions. 
Methods Three microarray datasets (GSE88804, GSE153002, and GSE36820) related to 
ACC were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. DEGs were 
identified using GEO2R and further analyzed for commonalities and differences. 
Functional enrichment analysis, including Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), 
provided insights into biological processes, cellular components, molecular 
functions, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways 
associated with ACC. PPI networks and hub genes were identified using the Search 
Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) (STRING 
Consortium, Lausanne, Switzerland) database and Cytoscape (Cytoscape Consortium, 
California, United States). The study also explored miRNAs, transcription 
factors, and potential drug-gene interactions. Results The integrated analysis 
revealed 339 common upregulated and 643 downregulated DEGs in ACC. Functional 
and pathway enrichment analyses unveiled the involvement of these genes in 
critical cellular processes, signaling cascades, and pathways. The PPI network, 
comprising 904 nodes and 4139 edges, highlighted the complexity of interactions. 
Hub genes, including KIF11, BUB1, and DLGAP5, were identified, shedding light on 
their pivotal roles in cell cycle regulation. The study also identified miRNAs 
(e.g., hsa-mir-7-5p and hsa-mir-138-5p) and transcription factors (e.g., E2F1 
and TP53) associated with ACC. Drug-gene interactions have identified potential 
therapeutic options, including amsacrine and rucaparib. Conclusions The ACC gene 
expression highlights a nuanced molecular landscape, identifying pivotal hub 
genes such as KIF11 and CDK1 as potential therapeutic targets for ACC, given 
their roles in cell cycle progression. The dysregulation of microRNAs and 
transcription factors adds complexity to ACC's molecular profile. Exploration of 
drug-gene interactions reveals promising therapeutic strategies, involving 
FDA-approved drugs such as amsacrine and rucaparib, providing avenues for 
personalized interventions.

BACKGROUND: Prioritizing candidate drugs based on genome-wide expression data is 
an emerging approach in systems pharmacology due to its holistic perspective for 
preclinical drug evaluation. In the current study, a network-based approach was 
proposed and applied to prioritize plant polyphenols and identify potential drug 
combinations in breast cancer. We focused on MEK5/ERK5 signalling pathway genes, 
a recently identified potential drug target in cancer with roles spanning major 
carcinogenesis processes.
RESULTS: By constructing and identifying perturbed protein-protein interaction 
networks for luminal A breast cancer, plant polyphenols and drugs from 
transcriptome data, we first demonstrated their systemic effects on the 
MEK5/ERK5 signalling pathway. Subsequently, we applied a pathway-specific 
network pharmacology pipeline to prioritize plant polyphenols and potential drug 
combinations for use in breast cancer. Our analysis prioritized genistein among 
plant polyphenols. Drug combination simulations predicted several FDA-approved 
drugs in breast cancer with well-established pharmacology as candidates for 
target network synergistic combination with genistein. This study also 
highlights the concept of target network enhancer drugs, with drugs previously 
not well characterised in breast cancer being prioritized for use in the 
MEK5/ERK5 pathway in breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: This study proposes a computational framework for drug 
prioritization and combination with the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway in breast 
cancer. The method is flexible and provides the scientific community with a 
robust method that can be applied to other complex diseases.

Retinol is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an essential role in many biological 
processes throughout the human lifespan. Here, we perform the largest 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) of retinol to date in up to 22,274 
participants. We identify eight common variant loci associated with retinol, as 
well as a rare-variant signal. An integrative gene prioritisation pipeline 
supports novel retinol-associated genes outside of the main retinol transport 
complex (RBP4:TTR) related to lipid biology, energy homoeostasis, and endocrine 
signalling. Genetic proxies of circulating retinol were then used to estimate 
causal relationships with almost 20,000 clinical phenotypes via a phenome-wide 
Mendelian randomisation study (MR-pheWAS). The MR-pheWAS suggests that retinol 
may exert causal effects on inflammation, adiposity, ocular measures, the 
microbiome, and MRI-derived brain phenotypes, amongst several others. 
Conversely, circulating retinol may be causally influenced by factors including 
lipids and serum creatinine. Finally, we demonstrate how a retinol polygenic 
score could identify individuals more likely to fall outside of the normative 
range of circulating retinol for a given age. In summary, this study provides a 
comprehensive evaluation of the genetics of circulating retinol, as well as 
revealing traits which should be prioritised for further investigation with 
respect to retinol related therapies or nutritional intervention.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by the 
reduction of survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein levels. Although three 
SMN-augmentation therapies are clinically approved that significantly slow down 
disease progression, they are unfortunately not cures. Thus, complementary 
SMN-independent therapies that can target key SMA pathologies and that can 
support the clinically approved SMN-dependent drugs are the forefront of 
therapeutic development. We have previously demonstrated that prednisolone, a 
synthetic glucocorticoid (GC) improved muscle health and survival in severe 
Smn-/-;SMN2 and intermediate Smn2B/- SMA mice. However, long-term administration 
of prednisolone can promote myopathy. We thus wanted to identify genes and 
pathways targeted by prednisolone in skeletal muscle to discover clinically 
approved drugs that are predicted to emulate prednisolone's activities. Using an 
RNA-sequencing, bioinformatics, and drug repositioning pipeline on skeletal 
muscle from symptomatic prednisolone-treated and untreated Smn-/-; SMN2 SMA and 
Smn+/-; SMN2 healthy mice, we identified molecular targets linked to 
prednisolone's ameliorative effects and a list of 580 drug candidates with 
similar predicted activities. Two of these candidates, metformin and 
oxandrolone, were further investigated in SMA cellular and animal models, which 
highlighted that these compounds do not have the same ameliorative effects on 
SMA phenotypes as prednisolone; however, a number of other important drug 
targets remain. Overall, our work further supports the usefulness of 
prednisolone's potential as a second-generation therapy for SMA, identifies a 
list of potential SMA drug treatments and highlights improvements for future 
transcriptomic-based drug repositioning studies in SMA.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) are both 
diseases that can seriously affect a patient's quality of life and generate 
economic pressure in society. Symptomatically, both DLU and CLE exhibit delayed 
healing and excessive inflammation; however, there is little evidence to support 
a molecular and cellular connection between these two diseases. In this study, 
we investigated potential common characteristics between DFU and CLE at the 
molecular level to provide new insights into skin diseases and regeneration, and 
identify potential targets for the development of new therapies. The gene 
expression profiles of DFU and CLE were obtained from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database and used for analysis. A total of 41 common 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 16 upregulated genes and 25 downregulated 
genes, were identified between DFU and CLE. GO and KEGG analysis showed that 
abnormalities in epidermal cells and the activation of inflammatory factors were 
both involved in the occurrence and development of DFU and CLE. Protein-protein 
interaction network (PPI) and sub-module analysis identified enrichment in seven 
common key genes which is KRT16, S100A7, KRT77, OASL, S100A9, EPGN and SAMD9. 
Based on these seven key genes, we further identified five 
miRNAs(has-mir-532-5p, 
has-mir-324-3p,has-mir-106a-5p,has-mir-20a-5p,has-mir-93-5p) and7 transcription 
factors including CEBPA, CEBPB, GLI1, EP30D, JUN,SP1, NFE2L2 as potential 
upstream molecules. Functional immune infiltration assays showed that these 
genes were related to immune cells. The CIBERSORT algorithm and Pearson method 
were used to determine the correlations between key genes and immune cells, and 
reverse key gene-immune cell correlations were found between DFU and CLE. 
Finally, the DGIbd database demonstrated that Paquinimod and Tasquinimod could 
be used to target S100A9 and Ribavirin could be used to target OASL. Our 
findings highlight common gene expression characteristics and signaling pathways 
between DFU and CLE, indicating a close association between these two diseases. 
This provides guidance for the development of targeted therapies and mutual 
interactions.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a common endocrine metabolic bone disease, which may 
lead to severe consequences. However, the unknown molecular mechanism of 
osteoporosis, the observable side effects of present treatments and the 
inability to fundamentally improve bone metabolism seriously restrict the impact 
of prevention and treatment. The study aims to identify potential biomarkers 
from osteoclast progenitors, specifically peripheral blood monocytes on 
predicting the osteoporotic phenotype.
METHODS: Datasets were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Based on the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and GSEA results, GO and KEGG analyses 
were performed using the DAVID database and Metascape database. PPI network, TF 
network, drug-gene interaction network, and ceRNA network were established to 
determine the hub genes. Its osteogenesis, migration, and proliferation 
abilities in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were validated through 
RT-qPCR, WB, ALP staining, VK staining, wound healing assay, transwell assay, 
and CCK-8 assay.
RESULTS: A total of 63 significant DEGs were screened. Functional and pathway 
enrichment analysis discovered that the functions of the significant DEGs 
(SDEGs) are mainly related to immunity and metal ions. A comprehensive 
evaluation of all the network analyses, PMAIP1 was defined as osteoporosis's 
core gene. This conclusion was further confirmed in clinical cohort data. A 
series of experiments demonstrated that the PMAIP1 gene can promote the 
osteogenesis, migration and proliferation of BMSC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: All of these outcomes showed a new theoretical basis for further 
research in the treatment of osteoporosis, and PMAIP1 was identified as a 
potential biomarker for osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is usually diagnosed at advanced stages. Hence, there 
is an urgent need to seek an effective biomarker to predict LUAD status. Long 
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in the development of tumors. However, 
the relationship between LINC00921 and LUAD remains unclear. The gene expression 
data of LUAD were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas database to 
investigate the expression level of LINC00921 in LUAD. Diagnostic ability 
analysis, survival analysis, tumor mutational burden analysis, and immune cell 
infiltration analysis of LINC00921 in LUAD patients were performed 
simultaneously. According to the median expression value of LINC00921, patients 
were divided into LINC00921 high- and low-expression groups. The function of 
LINC00921 in LUAD was identified through difference analysis and enrichment 
analysis. Moreover, drugs that may be relevant to LUAD treatment were screened. 
Finally, blood samples were collected for real-time polymerase chain reaction. 
LINC00921 was significantly lower in LUAD tumor tissues. Notably, patients with 
low expression of LINC00921 had a shorter median survival time. Decreased immune 
cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment in the low LINC00921 expression 
group may contribute to poorer patient outcomes. Tumor mutational burden was 
significantly different in survival between the LINC00921 high- and 
low-expression groups. In addition, LINC00921 may exert an influence on cancer 
development through its regulation of target genes transcription. 
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-related drugs may be more likely to be 
therapeutically effective in LUAD. LINC00921 was able to be used as the 
potential diagnostic indicator for LUAD.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant primary brain tumor with a 
poor prognosis. Reactive oxygen species that accumulate during tumorigenesis can 
cause oxidative stress (OS), which plays a crucial role in cancer cell survival. 
Clinical and transcriptome data of TCGA-GBM dataset from UCSC Xena database were 
analyzed. Consensus clustering analysis was conducted to identify OS-related 
molecular subtypes for GBM. The immune infiltrate level between subtypes were 
characterized by ESTIMATE algorithm. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
between subtypes were screened by DESeq2 package. Two OS-related molecular 
subtypes of GBM were identified, and cluster 2 had poorer overall survival and 
higher immune infiltration levels than cluster 1. Enrichment analysis showed 
that 54 DEGs in cluster 2 were significantly enriched in 
cytokine/chemokine-related functions or pathways. Ten hub genes (CSF2, CSF3, 
CCL7, LCN2, CXCL6, MMP8, CCR8, TNFSF11, IL22RA2, and ORM1) were identified in 
GBM subtype 2 through protein-protein interaction network, most of which were 
positively correlated with immune factors and immune checkpoints. A total of 55 
small molecule drugs obtained from drug gene interaction database (DGIdb) may 
have potential therapeutic effects in GBM subtype 2 patients. Our study 
identified 10 hub genes as potential therapeutic targets in GBM subtype 2 
patients, who have poorer overall survival and higher immune infiltration 
levels. These findings could pave the way for new treatments for this aggressive 
form of brain cancer.

PURPOSE: Models to study metastatic disease in rare cancers are needed to 
advance preclinical therapeutics and to gain insight into disease biology. 
Osteosarcoma is a rare cancer with a complex genomic landscape in which outcomes 
for patients with metastatic disease are poor. As osteosarcoma genomes are 
highly heterogeneous, multiple models are needed to fully elucidate key aspects 
of disease biology and to recapitulate clinically relevant phenotypes.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Matched patient samples, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), 
and PDX-derived cell lines were comprehensively evaluated using whole-genome 
sequencing and RNA sequencing. The in vivo metastatic phenotype of the 
PDX-derived cell lines was characterized in both an intravenous and an 
orthotopic murine model. As a proof-of-concept study, we tested the preclinical 
effectiveness of a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor on the growth of metastatic 
tumors in an orthotopic amputation model.
RESULTS: PDXs and PDX-derived cell lines largely maintained the expression 
profiles of the patient from which they were derived despite the emergence of 
whole-genome duplication in a subset of cell lines. The cell lines were 
heterogeneous in their metastatic capacity, and heterogeneous tissue tropism was 
observed in both intravenous and orthotopic models. Single-agent dinaciclib was 
effective at dramatically reducing the metastatic burden.
CONCLUSIONS: The variation in metastasis predilection sites between osteosarcoma 
PDX-derived cell lines demonstrates their ability to recapitulate the spectrum 
of the disease observed in patients. We describe here a panel of new 
osteosarcoma PDX-derived cell lines that we believe will be of wide use to the 
osteosarcoma research community.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) are the most 
common systemic autoimmune diseases, and they are increasingly being recognized 
as occurring in the same patient population. These two diseases share several 
clinical features and laboratory parameters, but the exact mechanism of their 
co-pathogenesis remains unclear. The intention of this study was to investigate 
the common molecular mechanisms involved in RA and pSS using integrated 
bioinformatic analysis. RNA-seq data for RA and pSS were picked up from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Co-expression genes linked with RA and pSS 
were recognized using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and 
differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis. Then, we screened two public 
disease-gene interaction databases (GeneCards and Comparative Toxicogenomics 
Database) for common targets associated with RA and pSS. The DGIdb database was 
used to predict therapeutic drugs for RA and pSS. The Human microRNA Disease 
Database (HMDD) was used to screen out the common microRNAs associated with RA 
and pSS. Finally, a common miRNA-gene network was created using Cytoscape. Four 
hub genes (CXCL10, GZMA, ITGA4, and PSMB9) were obtained from the intersection 
of common genes from WGCNA, differential gene analysis and public databases. 
Twenty-four drugs corresponding to hub gene targets were predicted in the DGIdb 
database. Among the 24 drugs, five drugs had already been reported for the 
treatment of RA and pSS. Other drugs, such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, 
oprozomib, cyclosporine and zidovudine, may be ideal drugs for the future 
treatment of RA patients with pSS. According to the miRNA-gene network, 
hsa-mir-21 may play a significant role in the mechanisms shared by RA and pSS. 
In conclusion, we identified commom targets as potential biomarkers in RA and 
pSS from publicly available databases and predicted potential drugs based on the 
targets. A new understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with RA and 
pSS is provided according to the miRNA-gene network.

It has been postulated that rare coding variants (RVs; MAF < 0.01) contribute to 
the "missing" heritability of complex traits. We developed a framework, the Rare 
variant heritability (RARity) estimator, to assess RV heritability (h2RV) 
without assuming a particular genetic architecture. We applied RARity to 31 
complex traits in the UK Biobank (n = 167,348) and showed that gene-level RV 
aggregation suffers from 79% (95% CI: 68-93%) loss of h2RV. Using unaggregated 
variants, 27 traits had h2RV > 5%, with height having the highest h2RV at 21.9% 
(95% CI: 19.0-24.8%). The total heritability, including common and rare 
variants, recovered pedigree-based estimates for 11 traits. RARity can estimate 
gene-level h2RV, enabling the assessment of gene-level characteristics and 
revealing 11, previously unreported, gene-phenotype relationships. Finally, we 
demonstrated that in silico pathogenicity prediction (variant-level) and 
gene-level annotations do not generally enrich for RVs that over-contribute to 
complex trait variance, and thus, innovative methods are needed to predict RV 
functionality.

BACKGROUND: Delirium seriously affects the prognosis of patients and greatly 
reduces the ability to work and live. Peripheral inflammatory events may 
contribute to the development of delirium, the mechanism of which is still 
unclear. There is a lack of effective diagnostic and treatments for delirium in 
clinical practice. The study aims to investigate alterations in peripheral 
immune cell subsets under inflammatory stress and to explore causal associations 
with delirium.
METHODS: Single-cell transcriptional sequencing data of human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) before and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intervention 
were processed by the Seurat package in R software. PBMC subsets and cellular 
markers were defined after downscaling and clustering by the Harmony algorithm 
to identify characteristic subsets in the context of inflammatory stress. 
Subsequently, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was used to 
explore the causal associations of these inflammation-related PBMC subsets and 
their molecular phenotypes with delirium. Based on publicly available genetic 
data, the study incorporated 70 PBMC-associated immune traits, including 8 types 
of circulating immune cells, 33 B cell subsets and molecular phenotypes, 13 T 
cell subsets, and 16 B cell-associated cytokines. The results were also 
validated for robustness, heterogeneity, and horizontal pleiotropy.
RESULTS: Under LPS-induced inflammatory stress, B cells, T cells, monocytes, and 
dendritic cells in human PBMC showed significant activation and quantitative 
changes. Of these, only lymphocyte and B cell counts were causally associated 
with delirium risk. This risk link is also seen in the TNF pathway. Further 
studies of B cells and their subsets revealed that this association may be 
related to unswitched memory B cells and CD27 expressed on memory B cells. 
Annotation of the screened SNPs revealed significant polymorphisms in CD27 and 
CD40 annotated by rs25680 and rs9883798, respectively. The functions of the key 
annotated genes may be related to the regulation of immune responses, cell 
differentiation, proliferation, and intercellular interactions.
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed the potential possibility that B cell, 
memory B cell subset, and TNF-related molecules may be involved in the 
development of delirium due to peripheral inflammation, which can provide clues 
for further investigation of delirium prevention and treatment strategies.

The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for bone development and maintaining 
skeletal homeostasis, making it particularly relevant in osteoporosis patients. 
Our study aimed to identify distinct molecular clusters associated with the Wnt 
pathway and develop a diagnostic model for osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
Caucasian women. We downloaded three datasets (GSE56814, GSE56815 and GSE2208) 
related to osteoporosis from the GEO database. Our analysis identified a total 
of 371 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between low and high bone mineral 
density (BMD) groups, with 12 genes associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, 
referred to as osteoporosis-associated Wnt pathway-related genes. Employing four 
independent machine learning models, we established a diagnostic model using the 
12 osteoporosis-associated Wnt pathway-related genes in the training set. The 
XGB model showed the most promising discriminative potential. We further 
validate the predictive capability of our diagnostic model by applying it to 
three external datasets specifically related to osteoporosis. Subsequently, we 
constructed a diagnostic nomogram based on the five crucial genes identified 
from the XGB model. In addition, through the utilization of DGIdb, we identified 
a total of 30 molecular compounds or medications that exhibit potential as 
promising therapeutic targets for osteoporosis. In summary, our comprehensive 
analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between the 
osteoporosis and Wnt signaling pathway.

Breast cancer responds variably to anticancer therapies, often leading to 
significant off-target effects. This study proposes that the variability in 
tumour responses and drug-induced adverse events is linked to the 
transcriptional profiles of cell surface receptors (CSRs) in breast tumours and 
normal tissues. We analysed multiple datasets to compare CSR expression in 
breast tumours with that in non-cancerous human tissues. Our findings correlate 
the drug responses of breast cancer cell lines with the expression levels of 
their targeted CSRs. Notably, we identified distinct differences in CSR 
expression between primary breast tumour subtypes and corresponding cell lines, 
which may influence drug response predictions. Additionally, we used clinical 
trial data to uncover associations between CSR gene expression in healthy 
tissues and the incidence of adverse drug reactions. This integrative approach 
facilitates the selection of optimal CSR targets for therapy, leveraging cell 
line dose-responses, CSR expression in normal tissues, and patient adverse event 
profiles.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as the functional receptor 
for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative 
agent of the ongoing global coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This 
study aimed to elucidate potential therapeutic avenues by scrutinizing approved 
drugs through the identification of the genetic signature associated with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with asthma. This exploration was conducted 
through an integrated analysis, encompassing interaction networks between the 
ACE2 receptor and common host (co-host) factors implicated in COVID-19/asthma 
comorbidity. The comprehensive analysis involved the identification of common 
differentially expressed genes (cDEGs) and hub-cDEGs, functional annotations, 
interaction networks, gene set variation analysis (GSVA), gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA), and module construction. Interaction networks were used to 
identify overlapping disease modules and potential drug targets. Computational 
biology and molecular docking analyzes were utilized to discern functional drug 
modules. Subsequently, the impact of the identified drugs on the expression of 
hub-cDEGs was experimentally validated using a mouse model. A total of 153 cDEGs 
or co-host factors associated with ACE2 were identified in the COVID-19 and 
asthma comorbidity. Among these, seven significant cDEGs and proteins - namely, 
HRAS, IFNG, JUN, CDH1, TLR4, ICAM1, and SCD-were recognized as pivotal host 
factors linked to ACE2. Regulatory network analysis of hub-cDEGs revealed eight 
top-ranked transcription factors (TFs) proteins and nine microRNAs as key 
regulatory factors operating at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional 
levels, respectively. Molecular docking simulations led to the proposal of 10 
top-ranked repurposable drug molecules (Rapamycin, Ivermectin, Everolimus, 
Quercetin, Estradiol, Entrectinib, Nilotinib, Conivaptan, Radotinib, and 
Venetoclax) as potential treatment options for COVID-19 in individuals with 
comorbid asthma. Validation analysis demonstrated that Rapamycin effectively 
inhibited ICAM1 expression in the HDM-stimulated mice group (p < 0.01). This 
study unveils the common pathogenesis and genetic signature underlying asthma 
and SARS-CoV-2 infection, delineated by the interaction networks of ACE2-related 
host factors. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and 
discovery of drugs aimed at more effective therapeutics within the context of 
lung disease comorbidities.

PURPOSE: Since age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is tightly associated with 
aging and cellular senescence, objective of this study was to investigate the 
association between plasma levels of senescence-related proteins (SRPs) and risk 
of AMD.
DESIGN: The whole study was based on two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) 
analysis.
METHODS: For MR analysis, the primary approach for MR analysis was the 
inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and the heterogeneity and pleiotropy of 
results were tested. The instrumental single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
associated with 110 SRPs were filtered and selected from a large genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) for plasma proteome involving 35,559 participants. The 
GWAS data of AMD was obtained from FinnGen consortium (6,157 AMD cases and 
288,237 controls) and further validated by using data from UK Biobank consortium 
(3,553 AMD cases and 147,089 controls).
RESULTS: The MR results at both discovery and validation stages supported the 
causality (IVW-P < 0.00045) between plasma levels of 4 SRPs (C3b, CTNNB1, CCL1, 
and CCL3L1) and the risk of AMD and supported potential causality (IVW-P < 0.05) 
between other 10 SRPs and risk of AMD. No heterogeneity or pleiotropy in these 
results was detected.
CONCLUSION: Our findings supported that high plasma levels of C3b, CTNNB1, CCL1, 
and CCL3L1 were associated with increased risk of AMD, thereby highlighting the 
role of systemic inflammation in AMD pathogenesis and providing the rationale 
for developing new preventative and therapeutic strategies.

Drug repurposing can accelerate drug development while reducing the cost and 
risk of toxicity typically associated with de novo drug design. Several 
disorders lacking pharmacological solutions and exhibiting poor results in 
clinical trials - such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) - could benefit from a 
cost-effective approach to finding new therapeutics. We previously developed a 
neural network model, Z-LaP Tracker, capable of quantifying behaviors in 
zebrafish larvae relevant to cognitive function, including activity, reactivity, 
swimming patterns, and optomotor response in the presence of visual and acoustic 
stimuli. Using this model, we performed a high-throughput screening of 
FDA-approved drugs to identify compounds that affect zebrafish larval behavior 
in a manner consistent with the distinct behavior induced by calcineurin 
inhibitors. Cyclosporine (CsA) and other calcineurin inhibitors have garnered 
interest for their potential role in the prevention of AD. We generated 
behavioral profiles suitable for cluster analysis, through which we identified 
64 candidate therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.

There is limited guidance on exploiting the genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR 
screens in cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) to identify new targets for individual 
cancer types. This study integrated multiple tools to filter these data in order 
to seek new therapeutic targets specific to head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC). The resulting pipeline prioritized 143 targetable 
dependencies that represented both well-studied targets and emerging target 
classes like mitochondrial carriers and RNA-binding proteins. In total, 14 
targets had clinical inhibitors used for other cancers or nonmalignant diseases 
that hold near-term potential to repurpose for HNSCC therapy. Comparing 
inhibitor response data that were publicly available for 13 prioritized targets 
between the cell lines with high vs. low dependency on each target uncovered 
novel therapeutic potential for the PAK2 serine/threonine kinase. PAK2 gene 
dependency was found to be associated with wild-type p53, low PAK2 mRNA, and 
diploid status of the 3q amplicon containing PAK2. These findings establish a 
generalizable pipeline to prioritize clinically relevant targets for individual 
cancer types using DepMap. Its application to HNSCC highlights novel relevance 
for PAK2 inhibition and identifies biomarkers of PAK2 inhibitor response.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm of the 
pleural tissue that lines the lungs and is mainly associated with long latency 
from asbestos exposure. This tumor has no effective therapeutic opportunities 
nowadays and has a very low five-year survival rate. In this sense, identifying 
molecular events that trigger the development and progression of this tumor is 
highly important to establish new and potentially effective treatments. We 
conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide expression studies publicly available 
at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress databases. The 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and we performed 
functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) 
to gain insight into the biological mechanisms underlying these genes. 
Additionally, we constructed survival prediction models for selected DEGs and 
predicted the minimum drug inhibition concentration of anticancer drugs for MPM. 
In total, 115 MPM tumor transcriptomes and 26 pleural tissue controls were 
analyzed. We identified 1046 upregulated DEGs in the MPM samples. Cellular 
signaling categories in tumor samples were associated with the TNF, PI3K-Akt, 
and AMPK pathways. The inflammatory response, regulation of cell migration, and 
regulation of angiogenesis were overrepresented biological processes. Expression 
of SOX17 and TACC1 were associated with reduced survival rates. This 
meta-analysis identified a list of DEGs in MPM tumors, cancer-related signaling 
pathways, and biological processes that were overrepresented in MPM samples. 
Some therapeutic targets to treat MPM are suggested, and the prognostic 
potential of key genes is shown.

Recent advances in the genomics of glioblastoma (GBM) led to the introduction of 
molecular neuropathology but failed to translate into treatment improvement. 
This is largely attributed to the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of GBM, 
which are considered the major obstacle to GBM therapy. Here, we use advanced 
human GBM-like organoid (LEGO: Laboratory Engineered Glioblastoma-like Organoid) 
models and provide an unprecedented comprehensive characterization of LEGO 
models using single-cell transcriptome, DNA methylome, metabolome, lipidome, 
proteome, and phospho-proteome analysis. We discovered that genetic 
heterogeneity dictates functional heterogeneity across molecular layers and 
demonstrates that NF1 mutation drives mesenchymal signature. Most importantly, 
we found that glycerol lipid reprogramming is a hallmark of GBM, and several 
targets and drugs were discovered along this line. We also provide a 
genotype-based drug reference map using LEGO-based drug screen. This study 
provides new human GBM models and a research path toward effective GBM therapy.

MOTIVATION: Post-market unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are associated 
with significant costs, in both financial burden and human health. Due to the 
high cost and time required to run clinical trials, there is significant 
interest in accurate computational methods that can aid in the prediction of 
ADRs for new drugs. As a machine learning task, ADR prediction is made more 
challenging due to a high degree of class imbalance and existing methods do not 
successfully balance the requirement to detect the minority cases (true 
positives for ADR), as measured by the Area Under the Precision-Recall (AUPR) 
curve with the ability to separate true positives from true negatives [as 
measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve]. 
Surprisingly, the performance of most existing methods is worse than a naïve 
method that attributes ADRs to drugs according to the frequency with which the 
ADR has been observed over all other drugs. The existing advanced methods 
applied do not lead to substantial gains in predictive performance.
RESULTS: We designed a rigorous evaluation to provide an unbiased estimate of 
the performance of ADR prediction methods: Nested Cross-Validation and a 
hold-out set were adopted. Among the existing methods, Kernel Regression (KR) 
performed best in AUPR but had a disadvantage in AUROC, relative to other 
methods, including the naïve method. We proposed a novel method that combines 
non-negative matrix factorization with kernel regression, called VKR. This novel 
approach matched or exceeded the performance of existing methods, overcoming the 
weakness of the existing methods.

BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis, is characterized by lipid peroxidation of fatty acids 
in the presence of iron ions, which leads to cell apoptosis. This leads to the 
disruption of metabolic pathways, ultimately resulting in liver dysfunction. 
Although ferroptosis is linked to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 
understanding the key ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) involved in NASH remains 
incomplete. NASH may be targeted therapeutically by identifying the genes 
responsible for ferroptosis.
METHODS: To identify ferroptosis-related genes and develop a ferroptosis-related 
signature (FeRS), 113 machine-learning algorithm combinations were used.
RESULTS: The FeRS constructed using the Generalized Linear Model Boosting 
algorithm and Gradient Boosting Machine algorithms exhibited the best prediction 
performance for NASH. Eight FRGs, with ZFP36 identified by the algorithms as the 
most crucial, were incorporated into in FeRS. ZFP36 is significantly enriched in 
various immune cell types and exhibits significant positive correlations with 
most immune signatures.
CONCLUSION: ZFP36 is a key FRG involved in NASH pathogenesis.

Pharmacogenomics aims to provide personalized therapy to patients based on their 
genetic variability. However, accurate prediction of cancer drug response (CDR) 
is challenging due to genetic heterogeneity. Since clinical data are limited, 
most studies predicting drug response use preclinical data to train models. 
However, such models might not be generalizable to external clinical data due to 
differences between the preclinical and clinical datasets. In this study, a 
Precision Medicine Prediction using an Adversarial Network for Cancer Drug 
Response (PANCDR) model is proposed. PANCDR consists of two sub-models, an 
adversarial model and a CDR prediction model. The adversarial model reduces the 
gap between the preclinical and clinical datasets, while the CDR prediction 
model extracts features and predicts responses. PANCDR was trained using both 
preclinical data and unlabeled clinical data. Subsequently, it was tested on 
external clinical data, including The Cancer Genome Atlas and brain tumor 
patients. PANCDR outperformed other machine learning models in predicting 
external test data. Our results demonstrate the robustness of PANCDR and its 
potential in precision medicine by recommending patient-specific drug 
candidates. The PANCDR codes and data are available at 
https://github.com/DMCB-GIST/PANCDR.

The process of drug development is expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, 
drug repurposing can be introduced to clinical practice more quickly and at a 
reduced cost. Over the last decade, there has been a significant expansion of 
large biobanks that link genomic data to electronic health record data, public 
availability of various databases containing biological and clinical information 
and rapid development of novel methodologies and algorithms in integrating 
different sources of data. This review aims to provide a thorough summary of 
different strategies that utilize genomic data to seek drug-repositioning 
opportunities. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify eligible 
studies up until 1 May 2023, with a total of 102 studies finally included after 
two-step parallel screening. We summarized commonly used strategies for drug 
repurposing, including Mendelian randomization, multi-omic-based and 
network-based studies and illustrated each strategy with examples, as well as 
the data sources implemented. By leveraging existing knowledge and 
infrastructure to expedite the drug discovery process and reduce costs, drug 
repurposing potentially identifies new therapeutic uses for approved drugs in a 
more efficient and targeted manner. However, technical challenges when 
integrating different types of data and biased or incomplete understanding of 
drug interactions are important hindrances that cannot be disregarded in the 
pursuit of identifying novel therapeutic applications. This review offers an 
overview of drug repurposing methodologies, providing valuable insights and 
guiding future directions for advancing drug repurposing studies.

Breast cancer remains a major public health challenge worldwide. The 
identification of accurate biomarkers is critical for the early detection and 
effective treatment of breast cancer. This study utilizes an integrative machine 
learning approach to analyze breast cancer gene expression data for superior 
biomarker and drug target discovery. Gene expression datasets, obtained from the 
GEO database, were merged post-preprocessing. From the merged dataset, 
differential expression analysis between breast cancer and normal samples 
revealed 164 differentially expressed genes. Meanwhile, a separate gene 
expression dataset revealed 350 differentially expressed genes. Additionally, 
the BGWO_SA_Ens algorithm, integrating binary grey wolf optimization and 
simulated annealing with an ensemble classifier, was employed on gene expression 
datasets to identify predictive genes including TOP2A, AKR1C3, EZH2, MMP1, 
EDNRB, S100B, and SPP1. From over 10,000 genes, BGWO_SA_Ens identified 1404 in 
the merged dataset (F1 score: 0.981, PR-AUC: 0.998, ROC-AUC: 0.995) and 1710 in 
the GSE45827 dataset (F1 score: 0.965, PR-AUC: 0.986, ROC-AUC: 0.972). The 
intersection of DEGs and BGWO_SA_Ens selected genes revealed 35 superior genes 
that were consistently significant across methods. Enrichment analyses uncovered 
the involvement of these superior genes in key pathways such as AMPK, 
Adipocytokine, and PPAR signaling. Protein-protein interaction network analysis 
highlighted subnetworks and central nodes. Finally, a drug-gene interaction 
investigation revealed connections between superior genes and anticancer drugs. 
Collectively, the machine learning workflow identified a robust gene signature 
for breast cancer, illuminated their biological roles, interactions and 
therapeutic associations, and underscored the potential of computational 
approaches in biomarker discovery and precision oncology.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in 
women, and drug resistance during treatment is a major challenge. However, the 
mechanisms underlying drug resistance are not fully understood. Here we applied 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) to clarify resistant rules to Herceptin and 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
METHODS: There are 12 HER2+ breast cancer patients who were done WES. Samples 
from tumor and surrounding tissues underwent DNA sequencing and analysis. 
Various experimental and bioinformatics techniques were employed, including 
genomic capture, mutation analysis (Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), etc.), 
bioinformatics assessments, and drug-gene interaction investigations. 
Ultimately, the study explored the association of APOB gene expression with 
breast cancer recurrence rates, immune cell infiltration, and drug response.
RESULTS: The C > T mutation frequency was highest in the Herceptin-insensitive 
(HI) and verification groups, codenamed YI, contrasting with the 
Herceptin-sensitive (HE) group. No microsatellite instability (MSI)-H patients 
were in the HE group, but both HI and YI groups had 1 each. Significant 
differences in transition-transversion (TiTv) were observed in the HI and YI 
groups rather than the HE group. In the TKI- insensitive (TI) group, C > T 
mutations were highest, differing from the TKI-sensitive (TE) group. TE group 
included 2 MSI-H patients. Significant differences in TiTv were found in the TI 
group rather than the TE group. Mutated APOB may resist Herceptin and TKI, 
increasing immune infiltration. We identified potential drugs targeting it.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that a higher percentage of C > T mutations, 
significant differences in TiTv, and MSI-H status may indicate Herceptin 
resistance, while a higher percentage of C > T mutations, significant 
differences in TiTv, and the absence of MSI-H may indicate TKI resistance in 
breast cancer patients. For patients resistant to both Herceptin and TKI, 
mutated APOB may play a crucial role in resistance.

Tinnitus is a heritable, highly prevalent auditory disorder treated by multiple 
medical specialties. Previous GWAS indicated high genetic correlations between 
tinnitus and hearing loss, with little indication of differentiating signals. We 
present a GWAS meta-analysis, triple previous sample sizes, and expand to 
non-European ancestries. GWAS in 596,905 Million Veteran Program subjects 
identified 39 tinnitus loci, and identified genes related to neuronal synapses 
and cochlear structural support. Applying state-of-the-art analytic tools, we 
confirm a large number of shared variants, but also a distinct genetic 
architecture of tinnitus, with higher polygenicity and large proportion of 
variants not shared with hearing difficulty. Tissue-expression analysis for 
tinnitus infers broad enrichment across most brain tissues, in contrast to 
hearing difficulty. Finally, tinnitus is not only correlated with hearing loss, 
but also with a spectrum of psychiatric disorders, providing potential new 
avenues for treatment. This study establishes tinnitus as a distinct disorder 
separate from hearing difficulties.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the rs717620 polymorphism in ABCC2, 
the gene encoding multidrug resistance protein 2, influences the therapeutic 
response to anti-seizure medications (ASMs). However, this result is not 
consistent, and the mechanism by which rs717620 influences ASM responses is 
unclear.
AIMS: The present study evaluated the association between rs717620 genotype and 
ASM efficacy, and examined the potential mechanisms.
MAIN: methods: We conducted a literature search of five electronic databases, 
Embase, Medline, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and 
Wanfang, to identify relevant studies on response to ASM therapy among rs717620 
genotypes. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis and drug-gene interaction 
analysis were also performed to assess the underlying mechanisms.
KEY FINDINGS: The pooled results for 18 studies revealed a significant 
association between rs717620 genotype and ASM resistance under the recessive 
model (TT vs. CT + CC: OR = 1.68, 95 % CI = 1.27-2.21, I2 = 3.1 %). A 
significant association was also found in the Asian population under the 
recessive model (TT vs. CT + CC: OR = 1.70, 95 % CI = 1.26-2.29, I2 = 29.3 %). 
Further analysis revealed that rs717620 regulates the expression of ABCC2 in 
human brain, while drug-gene interaction analysis suggested that ABCC2 interacts 
with oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine.
SIGNIFICANCE: The rs717620 polymorphism influences ASM therapeutic responses by 
altering brain expression levels of ABCC2.

BACKGROUND: Epilepsy, a central neurological disorder, has a complex genetic 
architecture. There is some evidence suggesting that genetic factors play a role 
in both the occurrence of epilepsy and its treatment. However, the genetic 
determinants of epilepsy are largely unknown. This study aimed to identify 
potential therapeutic targets for epilepsy.
METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were extracted from the 
expression profiles of GSE44031 and GSE1834. Gene co-expression analysis was 
used to confirm the regulatory relationship between newly discovered epilepsy 
candidate genes and known epilepsy genes. Expression quantitative trait loci 
analysis was conducted to determine if epilepsy risk single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms regulate DEGs' expression in human brain tissue. Finally, 
protein-protein interaction analysis and drug-gene interaction analysis were 
performed to assess the role of DEGs in epilepsy treatment.
RESULTS: The study found that the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type O 
gene (PTPRO) and the growth arrest and DNA damage inducible alpha gene (GADD45A) 
were significantly upregulated in epileptic rats compared to controls in both 
datasets. Gene co-expression analysis revealed that PTPRO was co-expressed with 
RBP4, NDN, PAK3, FOXG1, IDS, and IDS, and GADD45A was co-expressed with LRRK2 in 
human brain tissue. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis suggested that 
epilepsy risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms could be responsible for the 
altered PTPRO and GADD45A expression in human brain tissue. Moreover, the 
protein encoded by GADD45A had a direct interaction with approved antiepileptic 
drug targets, and GADD45A interacts with genistein and cisplatin.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight PTPRO and GADD45A as potential 
genes for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the world's most common 
malignancies. Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in characteristics 
beyond the DNA sequence. Epigenetic information is essential for maintaining 
specific expression patterns of genes and the normal development of individuals, 
and disorders of epigenetic modifications may alter the expression of oncogenes 
and tumor suppressor genes and affect the development of cancer. This study 
elucidates the relationship between epigenetics and the prognosis of CRC 
patients by developing a predictive model to explore the potential value of 
epigenetics in the treatment of CRC.
METHODS: Gene expression data of CRC patients' tumor tissue and controls were 
downloaded from GEO database. Combined with the 720 epigenetic-related genes 
(ERGs) downloaded from EpiFactors database, prognosis-related epigenetic genes 
were selected by univariate cox and LASSO analyses. The Kaplan-Meier and ROC 
curve were used to analyze the accuracy of the model. Data of 238 CRC samples 
with survival data downloaded from the GSE17538 were used for validation. 
Finally, the risk model is combined with the clinical characteristics of CRC 
patients to perform univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis to 
obtain independent risk factors and draw nomogram. Then we evaluated the 
accuracy of its prediction by calibration curves.
RESULTS: A total of 2906 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified 
between CRC and control samples. After overlapping DEGs with 720 ERGs, 56 
epigenetic-related DEGs (DEERGs) were identified. Combining univariate and LASSO 
regression analysis, the 8 epigenetic-related genes-based risk score model of 
CRC was established. The ROC curves and survival difference of high and low risk 
groups revealed the good performance of the risk score model based on prognostic 
biomarkers in both training and validation sets. A nomogram with good 
performance to predict the survival of CRC patients were established based on 
age, NM stage and risk score. The calibration curves showed that the prognostic 
model had good predictive performance.
CONCLUSION: In this study, an epigenetically relevant 8-gene signature was 
constructed that can effectively predict the prognosis of CRC patients and 
provide potential directions for targeted therapies for CRC.

Veterans are at an increased risk for prostate cancer, a disease with 
extraordinary clinical and molecular heterogeneity, compared with the general 
population. However, little is known about the underlying molecular 
heterogeneity within the veteran population and its impact on patient management 
and treatment. Using clinical and targeted tumor sequencing data from the 
National Veterans Affairs health system, we conducted a retrospective cohort 
study on 45 patients with advanced prostate cancer in the Veterans Precision 
Oncology Data Commons (VPODC), most of whom were metastatic 
castration-resistant. We characterized the mutational burden in this cohort and 
conducted unsupervised clustering analysis to stratify patients by molecular 
alterations. Veterans with prostate cancer exhibited a mutational landscape 
broadly similar to prior studies, including KMT2A and NOTCH1 mutations 
associated with neuroendocrine prostate cancer phenotype, previously reported to 
be enriched in veterans. We also identified several potential novel mutations in 
PTEN, MSH6, VHL, SMO, and ABL1 Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed two 
subgroups containing therapeutically targetable molecular features with novel 
mutational signatures distinct from those reported in the Catalogue of Somatic 
Mutations in Cancer database. The clustering approach presented in this study 
can potentially be used to clinically stratify patients based on their distinct 
mutational profiles and identify actionable somatic mutations for precision 
oncology.

VarCards, an online database, combines comprehensive variant- and gene-level 
annotation data to streamline genetic counselling for coding variants. 
Recognising the increasing clinical relevance of non-coding variations, there 
has been an accelerated development of bioinformatics tools dedicated to 
interpreting non-coding variations, including single-nucleotide variants and 
copy number variations. Regrettably, most tools remain as either locally 
installed databases or command-line tools dispersed across diverse online 
platforms. Such a landscape poses inconveniences and challenges for genetic 
counsellors seeking to utilise these resources without advanced bioinformatics 
expertise. Consequently, we developed VarCards2, which incorporates nearly nine 
billion artificially generated single-nucleotide variants (including those from 
mitochondrial DNA) and compiles vital annotation information for genetic 
counselling based on ACMG-AMP variant-interpretation guidelines. These 
annotations include (I) functional effects; (II) minor allele frequencies; (III) 
comprehensive function and pathogenicity predictions covering all potential 
variants, such as non-synonymous substitutions, non-canonical splicing variants, 
and non-coding variations and (IV) gene-level information. Furthermore, 
VarCards2 incorporates 368 820 266 documented short insertions and deletions and 
2 773 555 documented copy number variations, complemented by their corresponding 
annotation and prediction tools. In conclusion, VarCards2, by integrating over 
150 variant- and gene-level annotation sources, significantly enhances the 
efficiency of genetic counselling and can be freely accessed at

The Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb, https://dgidb.org) is a publicly 
accessible resource that aggregates genes or gene products, drugs and drug-gene 
interaction records to drive hypothesis generation and discovery for clinicians 
and researchers. DGIdb 5.0 is the latest release and includes substantial 
architectural and functional updates to support integration into clinical and 
drug discovery pipelines. The DGIdb service architecture has been split into 
separate client and server applications, enabling consistent data access for 
users of both the application programming interface (API) and web interface. The 
new interface was developed in ReactJS, and includes dynamic visualizations and 
consistency in the display of user interface elements. A GraphQL API has been 
added to support customizable queries for all drugs, genes, annotations and 
associated data. Updated documentation provides users with example queries and 
detailed usage instructions for these new features. In addition, six sources 
have been added and many existing sources have been updated. Newly added sources 
include ChemIDplus, HemOnc, NCIt (National Cancer Institute Thesaurus), 
Drugs@FDA, HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) and RxNorm. These new sources 
have been incorporated into DGIdb to provide additional records and enhance 
annotations of regulatory approval status for therapeutics. Methods for grouping 
drugs and genes have been expanded upon and developed as independent modular 
normalizers during import. The updates to these sources and grouping methods 
have resulted in an improvement in FAIR (findability, accessibility, 
interoperability and reusability) data representation in DGIdb.

Treatments for neurodegenerative disorders remain rare, but recent FDA 
approvals, such as lecanemab and aducanumab for Alzheimer disease (MIM: 607822), 
highlight the importance of the underlying biological mechanisms in driving 
discovery and creating disease modifying therapies. The global population is 
aging, driving an urgent need for therapeutics that stop disease progression and 
eliminate symptoms. In this study, we create an open framework and resource for 
evidence-based identification of therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative 
disease. We use summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to identify genetic 
targets for drug discovery and repurposing. In parallel, we provide mechanistic 
insights into disease processes and potential network-level consequences of 
gene-based therapeutics. We identify 116 Alzheimer disease, 3 amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (MIM: 105400), 5 Lewy body dementia (MIM: 127750), 46 
Parkinson disease (MIM: 605909), and 9 progressive supranuclear palsy (MIM: 
601104) target genes passing multiple test corrections (pSMR_multi < 2.95 × 10-6 
and pHEIDI > 0.01). We created a therapeutic scheme to classify our identified 
target genes into strata based on druggability and approved therapeutics, 
classifying 41 novel targets, 3 known targets, and 115 difficult targets (of 
these, 69.8% are expressed in the disease-relevant cell type from single-nucleus 
experiments). Our novel class of genes provides a springboard for new 
opportunities in drug discovery, development, and repurposing in the 
pre-competitive space. In addition, looking at drug-gene interaction networks, 
we identify previous trials that may require further follow-up such as riluzole 
in Alzheimer disease. We also provide a user-friendly web platform to help users 
explore potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases, decreasing 
activation energy for the community.

Oral cancer is one of the 19most rapidly progressing cancers associated with 
significant mortality, owing to its extreme degree of invasiveness and 
aggressive inclination. The early occurrences of this cancer can be clinically 
deceiving leading to a poor overall survival rate. The primary concerns from a 
clinical perspective include delayed diagnosis, rapid disease progression, 
resistance to various chemotherapeutic regimens, and aggressive metastasis, 
which collectively pose a substantial threat to prognosis. Conventional clinical 
practices observed since antiquity no longer offer the best possible options to 
circumvent these roadblocks. The world of current cancer research has been 
revolutionized with the advent of state-of-the-art technology-driven strategies 
that offer a ray of hope in confronting said challenges by highlighting the 
crucial underlying molecular mechanisms and drivers. In recent years, 
bioinformatics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have enhanced the 
possibility of early detection, evaluation of prognosis, and individualization 
of therapy. This review elaborates on the application of the aforesaid 
techniques in unraveling potential hints from omics big data to address the 
complexities existing in various clinical facets of oral cancer. The first 
section demonstrates the utilization of omics data and ML to disentangle the 
impediments related to diagnosis. This includes the application of 
technology-based strategies to optimize early detection, classification, and 
staging via uncovering biomarkers and molecular signatures. Furthermore, 
breakthrough concepts such as salivaomics-driven non-invasive biomarker 
discovery and omics-complemented surgical interventions are articulated in 
detail. In the following part, the identification of novel disease-specific 
targets alongside potential therapeutic agents to confront oral cancer via 
omics-based methodologies is presented. Additionally, a special emphasis is 
placed on drug resistance, precision medicine, and drug repurposing. In the 
final section, we discuss the research approaches oriented toward unveiling the 
prognostic biomarkers and constructing prediction models to capture the 
metastatic potential of the tumors. Overall, we intend to provide a bird's eye 
view of the various omics, bioinformatics, and ML approaches currently being 
used in oral cancer research through relevant case studies.

BACKGROUND: Chronic Bronchitis (CB) is a recurrent and persistent pulmonary 
inflammation disease. Growing evidence suggests an association between CB and 
Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-associated Glomerulonephritis (ANCA-GN). 
However, the precise mechanisms underlying their association remain unclear.
AIMS: The purpose of this study was to further explore the molecular mechanism 
of the occurrence of chronic bronchitis (CB) associated with anti-neutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody-associated glomerulonephritis (ANCA- GN).
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to investigate the potential shared pathogenesis of 
CB-associated ANCA-GN.
METHODS: Datasets of ANCA (GSE108113 and GSE104948) and CB (GSE151052 and 
GSE162635) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. 
Firstly, GSE108113 and GSE151052 were analyzed to identify common differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) by Limma package. Based on common DEGs, protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network and functional enrichment analyses, including GO, 
KEGG, and GSEA, were performed. Then, hub genes were identified by degree 
algorithm and validated in GSE104948 and GSE162635. Further PPI network and 
functional enrichment analyses were performed on hub genes. Additionally, a 
competitive ceRNA network was constructed through miRanda and spongeScan. 
Transcription factors (TFs) were predicted and verified using the TRRUST 
database. Furthermore, the CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to explore immune 
cell infiltration. The Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIDB) was utilized to 
predict small-molecular compounds of CB and ANCA-GN.
RESULTS: A total of 963 DEGs were identified in the integrated CB dataset, and 
610 DEGs were identified in the integrated ANCA-GN dataset. Totally, we 
identified 22 common DEGs, of which 10 hub genes (LYZ, IRF1, PIK3CG, IL2RG, 
NT5E, ARG2, HBEGF, NFATC2, ALPL, and FKBP5) were primarily involved in 
inflammation and immune responses. Focusing on hub genes, we constructed a ceRNA 
network composed of 323 miRNAs and 348 lncRNAs. Additionally, five TFs (SP1, 
RELA, NFKB1, HIF1A, and SP3) were identified to regulate the hub genes. 
Furthermore, immune cell infiltration results revealed immunoregulation in CB 
and ANCA-GN. Finally, some small-molecular compounds (Daclizumab, Aldesleukin, 
and NT5E) were predicted to predominantly regulate inflammation and immunity, 
especially IL-2.
CONCLUSION: Our study explores the inflammatory-immune pathways underlying 
CB-associated ANCA-GN and emphasizes the importance of NETs and lymphocyte 
differentiation, providing novel insights into the shared pathogenesis and 
therapeutic targets.

INTRODUCTION: To elucidate the candidate biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis 
process of heart failure (HF) via analysis of differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) of the dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The GSE76701 gene expression profiles regarding the HF and 
control subjects were respectively analysed. Briefly, DEGs were firstly 
identified and subjected to Cytoscape plug-in ClueGO + CluePedia and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. A protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network was then built to analyse the interaction between 
DEGs, followed by the construction of an interaction network by combining with 
hub genes with the targeted miRNA genes of DEGs to identify the key molecules of 
HF. In addition, potential drugs targeting key DEGs were sought using the 
drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb), and a drug-mRNA-miRNA interaction 
network was also constructed.
RESULTS: A total of 489 DEGs were verified between HF and control, which mainly 
enriched in type I interferon and leukocyte migration according to molecular 
function. Significantly increased levels of GAPDH, GALM1, MMP9, CCL5, and GNAL2 
were found in the HF setting and were identified as the hub genes based on the 
PPI network. Furthermore, according to the drug-mRNA-miRNA network, FCGR2B, 
CCND1, and NF-κb, as well as corresponding miRNA-605-5p, miRNA-147a, and 
miRNA-671-5p were identified as the drug targets of HF.
CONCLUSIONS: The hub genes GAPDH, GALM1, MMP9, CCL5, and GNAL2 were 
significantly increased in HF. miRNA-605-5p, miRNA-147a, and miRNA-671-5p were 
predicted as the drug target-interacted gene-miRNA of HF.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a disease in which cerebral blood flow is blocked 
due to various reasons, leading to ischemia, hypoxia, softening, and even 
necrosis of brain tissues. The level of cortisol is related to the occurrence 
and progression of ischemic stroke. However, the mechanism governing their 
interrelationship is still unclear. The main objective of this study was to 
identify and understand the molecular mechanism between cortisol and IS.
METHODS: The common cortisol-related biological processes were screened by 
mutual verification of two data sets and the cortisol-related hub biomarkers 
were identified. Modular analysis of protein interaction networks was performed, 
and the differential pathway analysis of individual genes was conducted by GSVA 
and GSEA. Drug and transcription factor regulatory networks of hub genes were 
excavated, and the diagnostic potential of hub genes was analyzed followed by 
the construction of a diagnostic model.
RESULTS: By screening the two data sets by GSVA, three biological processes with 
common differences were obtained. After variation analysis, four 
cortisol-related hub biomarkers (CYP1B1, CDKN2B, MEN1, and USP8) were selected. 
Through the modular analysis of the protein-protein interaction network and 
double verification of GSVA and GSEA, a series of potential molecular mechanisms 
of hub genes were discovered followed by a series of drug regulatory networks 
and transcription factor regulatory networks. The hub biomarkers were found to 
have a high diagnostic value by ROC; thus, a diagnostic model with high 
diagnostic efficiency was constructed. The diagnostic value was mutually 
confirmed in the two data sets.
CONCLUSION: Four cortisol-related hub biomarkers are identified in this study, 
which provides new ideas for the key changes of cortisol during the occurrence 
of IS.

The explosive growth of biomedical Big Data presents both significant 
opportunities and challenges in the realm of knowledge discovery and 
translational applications within precision medicine. Efficient management, 
analysis, and interpretation of big data can pave the way for groundbreaking 
advancements in precision medicine. However, the unprecedented strides in the 
automated collection of large-scale molecular and clinical data have also 
introduced formidable challenges in terms of data analysis and interpretation, 
necessitating the development of novel computational approaches. Some potential 
challenges include the curse of dimensionality, data heterogeneity, missing 
data, class imbalance, and scalability issues. This overview article focuses on 
the recent progress and breakthroughs in the application of big data within 
precision medicine. Key aspects are summarized, including content, data sources, 
technologies, tools, challenges, and existing gaps. Nine fields-Datawarehouse 
and data management, electronic medical record, biomedical imaging informatics, 
Artificial intelligence-aided surgical design and surgery optimization, omics 
data, health monitoring data, knowledge graph, public health informatics, and 
security and privacy-are discussed.

AIMS/INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the roles of voltage-dependent anion 
channel 1-related differentially expressed genes (VRDEGs) in diabetic 
nephropathy (DN).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We downloaded two datasets from patients with DN, namely, 
GSE30122 and GSE30529, from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. VRDEGs 
associated with DN were obtained from the intersection of voltage-dependent 
anion channel 1-related genes from the GeneCards database, and differentially 
expressed genes were screened according to group (DN/healthy) in the two 
datasets. The enriched pathways of the VRDEGs were analyzed. Hub genes were 
selected using a protein-protein interaction network, and their predictive value 
was verified through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 
CIBERSORTx software examined hub genes and immune cell infiltration 
associations. The protein expression of hub genes was verified through 
immunohistochemistry in 16-week-old db/db mice for experimentation as a model of 
type 2 DN. Finally, potential drugs targeting hub genes that inhibit DN 
development were identified.
RESULTS: A total of 57 VRDEGs were identified. The two datasets showed high 
expression of the PI3K, Notch, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-10 and 
interleukin-17 pathways in DN. Five hub genes (ITGAM, B2M, LYZ, C3 and CASP1) 
associated with DN were identified and verified. Immunohistochemistry showed 
that the five hub genes were highly expressed in db/db mice, compared with db/m 
mice. The infiltration of immune cells was significantly correlated with the 
five hub genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Five hub genes were significantly correlated with immune cell 
infiltration and might be crucial to DN development. This study provides insight 
into the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of DN.

Tauopathies, diseases characterized by neuropathological aggregates of tau 
including Alzheimer's disease and subtypes of frontotemporal dementia, make up 
the vast majority of dementia cases. Although there have been recent 
developments in tauopathy biomarkers and disease-modifying treatments, ongoing 
progress is required to ensure these are effective, economical, and accessible 
for the globally ageing population. As such, continued identification of new 
potential drug targets and biomarkers is critical. "Big data" studies, such as 
proteomics, can generate information on thousands of possible new targets for 
dementia diagnostics and therapeutics, but currently remain underutilized due to 
the lack of a clear process by which targets are selected for future drug 
development. In this review, we discuss current tauopathy biomarkers and 
therapeutics, and highlight areas in need of improvement, particularly when 
addressing the needs of frail, comorbid and cognitively impaired populations. We 
highlight biomarkers which have been developed from proteomic data, and outline 
possible future directions in this field. We propose new criteria by which 
potential targets in proteomics studies can be objectively ranked as favorable 
for drug development, and demonstrate its application to our group's recent tau 
interactome dataset as an example.

BACKGROUND: High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a serious mountain sickness 
with certain mortality. Its early diagnosis is very important. However, the 
mechanism of its onset and progression is still controversial.
AIM: This study aimed to analyze the HAPE occurrence and development mechanism 
and search for prospective biomarkers in peripheral blood.
METHODS: The difference genes (DEGs) of the Control group and the HAPE group 
were enriched by gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) enrichment analysis, and then GSEA analysis was performed. After 
identifying the immune-related hub genes, QPCR was used to verify and analyze 
the hub gene function and diagnostic value with single-gene GSEA and ROC curves, 
and the drugs that acted on the hub gene was found in the CTD database. Immune 
infiltration and its association with the hub genes were analyzed using 
CIBERSORT. Finally, WGCNA was employed to investigate immune invasion cells' 
significantly related gene modules, following enrichment analysis of their GO 
and KEGG.
RESULTS: The dataset enrichment analysis, immune invasion analysis and WGCNA 
analysis showed that the occurrence and early progression of HAPE were unrelated 
to inflammation. The hub genes associated with immunity obtained with MCODE 
algorithm of Cytoscape were JAK2 and B2M.. RT-qPCR and ROC curves confirmed that 
the hub gene B2M was a specific biomarker of HAPE and had diagnostic value, and 
single-gene GSEA analysis confirmed that it participated in MHC I 
molecule-mediated antigen presentation ability decreased, resulting in reduced 
immunity.
CONCLUSION: Occurrence and early progression of high altitude pulmonary edema 
may not be related to inflammation. B2M may be a new clinical potential 
biomarker for HAPE for early diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation as well as 
therapeutic targets, and its decrease may be related to reduced immunity due to 
reduced ability of MCH I to participate in antigen submission.

BACKGROUND: It is documented that osteoarthritis can promote the progression of 
breast cancer (BC).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to search for the essential genes associated with 
breast cancer (BC) and osteoarthritis (OA), explore the relationship between 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)- related genes and the two diseases, and 
identify the candidate drugs.
METHODS: The genes related to both BC and OA were determined by text mining. 
Protein-protein Interaction (PPI) analysis was carried out, and as a result, the 
exported genes were found to be related to EMT. PPI and the correlation of mRNA 
of these genes were also analyzed. Different kinds of enrichment analyses were 
performed on these genes. A prognostic analysis was performed on these genes for 
examining their expression levels at different pathological stages, in different 
tissues, and in different immune cells. Drug-gene interaction database was 
employed for potential drug discovery.
RESULTS: A total number of 1422 genes were identified as common to BC and OA and 
58 genes were found to be related to EMT. We found that HDAC2 and TGFBR1 were 
significantly poor in overall survival. High expression of HDAC2 plays a vital 
role in the increase of pathological stages. Four immune cells might play a role 
in this process. Fifty-seven drugs were identified that could potentially have 
therapeutic effects.
CONCLUSION: EMT may be one of the mechanisms by which OA affects BC. Using the 
drugs can have potential therapeutic effects, which may benefit patients with 
both diseases and broaden the indications for drug use.

During early pregnancy, extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) play a crucial role in 
modifying the maternal uterine environment. Failures in EVT lineage formation 
and differentiation can lead to pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, 
fetal growth restriction, and pregnancy loss. Despite recent advances, our 
knowledge on molecular and external factors that control and affect EVT 
development remains incomplete. Using trophoblast organoid in vitro models, we 
recently discovered that coordinated manipulation of the transforming growth 
factor beta (TGFβ) signaling is essential for EVT development. To further 
investigate gene networks involved in EVT function and development, we performed 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on our RNA-Seq data. We 
identified 10 modules with a median module membership of over 0.8 and sizes 
ranging from 1005 (M1) to 72 (M27) network genes associated with TGFβ activation 
status or in vitro culturing, the latter being indicative for yet undiscovered 
factors that shape the EVT phenotypes. Lastly, we hypothesized that certain 
therapeutic drugs might unintentionally interfere with placentation by affecting 
EVT-specific gene expression. We used the STRING database to map correlations 
and the Drug-Gene Interaction database to identify drug targets. Our 
comprehensive dataset of drug-gene interactions provides insights into potential 
risks associated with certain drugs in early gestation.

Single-agent regorafenib is approved in Canada for metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) patients who have failed previous lines of therapy. Identifying 
prognostic biomarkers is key to optimizing therapeutic strategies for these 
patients. In this clinical study (NCT01949194), we evaluated the safety and 
efficacy of single-agent regorafenib as a second-line therapy for mCRC patients 
who received it after failing first-line therapy with an oxaliplatin or 
irinotecan regimen with or without bevacizumab. Using various omics approaches, 
we also investigated putative biomarkers of response and resistance to 
regorafenib in metastatic lesions and blood samples in the same cohort. Overall, 
the safety profile of regorafenib seemed similar to the CORRECT trial, where 
regorafenib was administered as ≥ 2 lines of therapy. While the mutational 
landscape showed typical mutation rates for the top five driver genes (APC, 
KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and TP53), KRAS mutations were enriched in intrinsically 
resistant lesions. Additional exploration of genomic-phenotype associations 
revealed several biomarker candidates linked to unfavorable prognoses in 
patients with mCRC using various approaches, including pathway analysis, cfDNA 
profiling, and copy number analysis. However, further research endeavors are 
necessary to validate the potential utility of these promising genes in 
understanding patients' responses to regorafenib treatment.

BACKGROUND: The pharmaceutical field faces a significant challenge in validating 
drug target interactions (DTIs) due to the time and cost involved, leading to 
only a fraction being experimentally verified. To expedite drug discovery, 
accurate computational methods are essential for predicting potential 
interactions. Recently, machine learning techniques, particularly graph-based 
methods, have gained prominence. These methods utilize networks of drugs and 
targets, employing knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to represent structured 
information from knowledge graphs in a continuous vector space. This phenomenon 
highlights the growing inclination to utilize graph topologies as a means to 
improve the precision of predicting DTIs, hence addressing the pressing 
requirement for effective computational methodologies in the field of drug 
discovery.
RESULTS: The present study presents a novel approach called DTIOG for the 
prediction of DTIs. The methodology employed in this study involves the 
utilization of a KGE strategy, together with the incorporation of contextual 
information obtained from protein sequences. More specifically, the study makes 
use of Protein Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers 
(ProtBERT) for this purpose. DTIOG utilizes a two-step process to compute 
embedding vectors using KGE techniques. Additionally, it employs ProtBERT to 
determine target-target similarity. Different similarity measures, such as 
Cosine similarity or Euclidean distance, are utilized in the prediction 
procedure. In addition to the contextual embedding, the proposed unique approach 
incorporates local representations obtained from the Simplified Molecular Input 
Line Entry Specification (SMILES) of drugs and the amino acid sequences of 
protein targets.
CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the proposed approach was assessed through 
extensive experimentation on datasets pertaining to Enzymes, Ion Channels, and 
G-protein-coupled Receptors. The remarkable efficacy of DTIOG was showcased 
through the utilization of diverse similarity measures in order to calculate the 
similarities between drugs and targets. The combination of these factors, along 
with the incorporation of various classifiers, enabled the model to outperform 
existing algorithms in its ability to predict DTIs. The consistent observation 
of this advantage across all datasets underlines the robustness and accuracy of 
DTIOG in the domain of DTIs. Additionally, our case study suggests that the 
DTIOG can serve as a valuable tool for discovering new DTIs.

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a secreted ligand that is widely expressed in 
embryonic tissues but its expression decreases with age. In the developing 
prostate, FGF5 has been proposed to interact with the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling 
pathway to guide mitogenic processes. In the adult prostate, the FGF/FGFR 
signaling axis has been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis, but focused 
studies on FGF5 functions in the prostate are limited. Functional studies 
completed in other cancer models point towards FGF5 overexpression as an 
oncogenic driver associated with stemness, metastatic potential, proliferative 
capacity, and increased tumor grade. In this review, we explore the significance 
of FGF5 as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer (PCa) and other malignancies; 
and we introduce a potential route of investigation to link FGF5 to benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PCa and BPH are two primary contributors to the 
disease burden of the aging male population and have severe implications on 
quality of life, psychological wellbeing, and survival. The development of new 
FGF5 inhibitors could potentially alleviate the health burden of PCa and BPH in 
the aging male population.

The depth of knowledge offered by post-genomic medicine has carried the promise 
of new drugs, and cures for multiple diseases. To explore the degree to which 
this capability has materialized, we extract meta-data from 356,403 clinical 
trials spanning four decades, aiming to offer mechanistic insights into the 
innovation practices in drug discovery. We find that convention dominates over 
innovation, as over 96% of the recorded trials focus on previously tested drug 
targets, and the tested drugs target only 12% of the human interactome. If 
current patterns persist, it would take 170 years to target all druggable 
proteins. We uncover two network-based fundamental mechanisms that currently 
limit target discovery: preferential attachment, leading to the repeated 
exploration of previously targeted proteins; and local network effects, limiting 
exploration to proteins interacting with highly explored proteins. We build on 
these insights to develop a quantitative network-based model to enhance drug 
discovery in clinical trials.

There is variability in the metabolic health status among individuals presenting 
with obesity; some may be metabolically healthy, while others may have developed 
the metabolic syndrome, a cluster including insulin resistance, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. 
The mechanisms contributing to this metabolic heterogeneity are not fully 
understood. To address this question, plasma samples from 48 individuals with 
BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 were examined (27 with and 21 without metabolic syndrome). 
Fasting plasma samples were subjected to Olink proteomics analysis for 184 
cardiometabolic and inflammation-enriched proteins. Data analysis showed a clear 
differentiation between the two groups with distinct plasma protein expression 
profiles. Twenty-four proteins were differentially expressed (DEPs) between the 
two groups. Pathways related to immune cell migration, leukocyte chemotaxis, 
chemokine signaling, mucosal inflammatory response, tissue repair and remodeling 
were enriched in the group with metabolic syndrome. Functional analysis of DEPs 
revealed upregulation of 15 immunological pathways. The study identifies some of 
the pathways that are altered and reflect metabolic health in individuals with 
obesity. This provides valuable insights into some of the underlying mechanisms 
and can lead to identification of therapeutic targets to improve metabolic 
health in individuals with obesity.

BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine, a highly disabling migraine subtype, affects 
nearly 2% of the general population. Understanding migraine chronification is 
vital for developing better treatment and prevention strategies. An important 
factor in the chronification of migraine is the overuse of acute headache 
medication. However, the mechanisms behind the transformation of episodic 
migraine to chronic migraine and vice versa have not yet been elucidated. We 
performed a longitudinal epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA 
methylation (DNAm) changes associated with treatment response in patients with 
chronic migraine and medication overuse as part of the Chronification and 
Reversibility of Migraine clinical trial. Blood was taken from patients with 
chronic migraine (n = 98) at baseline and after a 12-week medication withdrawal 
period. Treatment responders, patients with ≥ 50% reduction in monthly headache 
days (MHD), were compared with non-responders to identify DNAm changes 
associated with treatment response. Similarly, patients with ≥ 50% versus < 50% 
reduction in monthly migraine days (MMD) were compared.
RESULTS: At the epigenome-wide significant level (p < 9.42 × 10-8), a 
longitudinal reduction in DNAm at an intronic CpG site (cg14377273) within the 
HDAC4 gene was associated with MHD response following the withdrawal of acute 
medication. HDAC4 is highly expressed in the brain, plays a major role in 
synaptic plasticity, and modulates the expression and release of several 
neuroinflammation markers which have been implicated in migraine 
pathophysiology. Investigating whether baseline DNAm associated with treatment 
response, we identified lower baseline DNAm at a CpG site (cg15205829) within 
MARK3 that was significantly associated with MMD response at 12 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of a longitudinal reduction in HDAC4 DNAm status 
associated with treatment response and baseline MARK3 DNAm status as an early 
biomarker for treatment response, provide support for a role of pathways related 
to chromatin structure and synaptic plasticity in headache chronification and 
introduce HDAC4 and MARK3 as novel therapeutic targets.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has taken on major importance in clinical 
oncology practice. With the advent of targeted therapies capable of effectively 
targeting specific genomic alterations in cancer patients, the development of 
bioinformatics processes has become crucial. Thus, bioinformatics pipelines play 
an essential role not only in the detection and in identification of molecular 
alterations obtained from NGS data but also in the analysis and interpretation 
of variants, making it possible to transform raw sequencing data into meaningful 
and clinically useful information. In this review, we aim to examine the 
multiple steps of a bioinformatics pipeline as used in current clinical 
practice, and we also provide an updated list of the necessary bioinformatics 
tools. This resource is intended to assist researchers and clinicians in their 
genetic data analyses, improving the precision and efficiency of these processes 
in clinical research and patient care.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a complex and multi-gene inherited 
disease caused by both genetic and environmental factors. However, due to the 
high cost of diagnosis and complex operation, its clinical application is 
limited. This study aims to explore potential target genes associated with OSA 
and establish a corresponding diagnostic model.
METHODS: This study used microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to OSA 
and perform functional annotation and pathway analysis. The study employed 
multi-scale embedded gene co-expression network analysis (MEGENA) combined with 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis to 
select hub genes and construct a diagnostic model for OSA. In addition, the 
study conducted correlation analysis between hub genes and OSA-related genes, 
immunoinfiltration, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), miRNA network analysis, 
and identified potential transcription factors (TFs) and targeted drugs for hub 
genes. Finally, the study used chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) mouse model to 
simulate OSA hypoxic conditions and verify the expression of hub genes in CIH 
mice.
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 401 upregulated genes and 275 downregulated 
genes were identified, and enrichment analysis revealed that these 
differentially expressed genes may be associated with pathways such as 
vasculature development, cellular response to cytokine stimulus, and negative 
regulation of cell population proliferation. Through MEGENA combined with LASSO 
regression, seven OSA hub genes were identified, including C12orf54, FOS, GPR1, 
OR9A4, MYO5B, RAB39B, and KLHL4. The diagnostic model constructed based on these 
genes showed strong stability. The expression levels of hub genes were 
significantly correlated with the expression levels of OSA-related genes and 
mainly acted on pathways such as the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and the 
cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. Drug-target predictions for hub genes were made 
using the Connectivity Map (CMap) database and the Drug-Gene Interaction 
database (Dgidb), which identified targeted therapeutic drugs for the hub genes. 
In vivo experiments showed that the hub genes were all decreasing in the OSA 
mouse model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified novel biomarkers for OSA and established a 
reliable diagnostic model. The transcriptional changes identified may help to 
reveal the pathogenesis, mechanisms, and sequelae of OSA.

OBJECTIVE: The diversity of nomenclature and naming strategies makes therapeutic 
terminology difficult to manage and harmonize. As the number and complexity of 
available therapeutic ontologies continues to increase, the need for harmonized 
cross-resource mappings is becoming increasingly apparent. This study creates 
harmonized concept mappings that enable the linking together of like-concepts 
despite source-dependent differences in data structure or semantic 
representation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, we created Thera-Py, a Python package and 
web API that constructs searchable concepts for drugs and therapeutic 
terminologies using 9 public resources and thesauri. By using a directed graph 
approach, Thera-Py captures commonly used aliases, trade names, annotations, and 
associations for any given therapeutic and combines them under a single concept 
record.
RESULTS: We highlight the creation of 16 069 unique merged therapeutic concepts 
from 9 distinct sources using Thera-Py and observe an increase in overlap of 
therapeutic concepts in 2 or more knowledge bases after harmonization using 
Thera-Py (9.8%-41.8%).
CONCLUSION: We observe that Thera-Py tends to normalize therapeutic concepts to 
their underlying active ingredients (excluding nondrug therapeutics, eg, 
radiation therapy, biologics), and unifies all available descriptors regardless 
of ontological origin.

OBJECTIVES: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully revealed 
numerous susceptibility loci for obesity. However, identifying the causal genes, 
pathways, and tissues/cell types responsible for these associations remains a 
challenge, and standardized analysis workflows are lacking. Additionally, due to 
limited treatment options for obesity, there is a need for the development of 
new pharmacological therapies. This study aimed to address these issues by 
performing step-wise utilization of knowledgebase for gene prioritization and 
assessing the potential relevance of key obesity genes as therapeutic targets.
METHODS AND RESULTS: First, we generated a list of 28,787 obesity-associated 
SNPs from the publicly available GWAS dataset (approximately 800,000 individuals 
in the GIANT meta-analysis). Then, we prioritized 1372 genes with significant in 
silico evidence against genomic and transcriptomic data, including 
transcriptionally regulated genes in the brain from transcriptome-wide 
association studies. In further narrowing down the gene list, we selected key 
genes, which we found to be useful for the discovery of potential drug seeds as 
demonstrated in lipid GWAS separately. We thus identified 74 key genes for 
obesity, which are highly interconnected and enriched in several biological 
processes that contribute to obesity, including energy expenditure and 
homeostasis. Of 74 key genes, 37 had not been reported for the pathophysiology 
of obesity. Finally, by drug-gene interaction analysis, we detected 23 (of 74) 
key genes that are potential targets for 78 approved and marketed drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide valuable insights into new treatment options 
for obesity through a data-driven approach that integrates multiple up-to-date 
knowledgebases.

PURPOSE: COVID-19 strangely kills some youth with no history of physical 
weakness, and in addition to the lungs, it may even directly harm other organs. 
Its complex mechanism has led to the loss of any significantly effective drug, 
and some patients with severe forms still die daily. Common methods for 
identifying disease mechanisms and drug design are often time-consuming or 
reductionist. Here, we use a novel holistic systems biology approach to predict 
its molecular mechanisms (in vitro), significant molecular relations with SARS, 
and repurpose drugs.
METHODS: We have utilized its relative phylogenic similarity to SARS. Using the 
available omics data for SARS and the fewer data for COVID-19 to decode the 
mechanisms and their significant relations, We applied the Cytoscape analyzer, 
MCODE, STRING, and DAVID tools to predict the topographically crucial molecules, 
clusters, protein interaction mappings, and functional analysis. We also applied 
a novel approach to identify the significant relations between the two 
infections using the Fischer exact test for MCODE clusters. We then constructed 
and analyzed a drug-gene network using PharmGKB and DrugBank (retrieved using 
the dgidb).
RESULTS: Some of the shared identified crucial molecules, BPs and pathways 
included Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, Influenza A, and 
NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. Besides, our identified crucial molecules 
specific to host response against SARS-CoV-2 included FGA, BMP4, PRPF40A, and 
IFI16.
CONCLUSION: We also introduced seven new repurposed candidate drugs based on the 
drug-gene network analysis for the identified crucial molecules. Therefore, we 
suggest that our newly recommended repurposed drugs be further investigated in 
Vitro and in Vivo against COVID-19.

Zika virus (ZIKV) infections are typically asymptomatic but cause severe 
neurological complications (e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, and 
microcephaly in newborns). There are currently no specific therapy or vaccine 
options available to prevent ZIKV infections. Temporal gene expression profiles 
of ZIKV-infected human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were used 
in this study to identify genes essential for viral replication. These genes 
were then used to identify novel anti-ZIKV agents and validated in publicly 
available data and functional wet-lab experiments. Here, we found that ZIKV 
effectively evaded activation of immune response-related genes and completely 
reprogrammed cellular transcriptional architectures. Knockdown of genes, which 
gradually upregulated during viral infection but showed distinct expression 
patterns between ZIKV- and mock infection, discovered novel proviral and 
antiviral factors. One-third of the 74 drugs found through signature-based drug 
repositioning and cross-reference with the Drug Gene Interaction Database 
(DGIdb) were known anti-ZIKV agents. In cellular assays, two promising antiviral 
candidates (Luminespib/NVP-AUY922, L-161982) were found to reduce viral 
replication without causing cell toxicity. Overall, our time-series 
transcriptome-based methods offer a novel and feasible strategy for antiviral 
drug discovery. Our strategies, which combine conventional and data-driven 
analysis, can be extended for other pathogens causing pandemics in the future.

Background: Drug repurposing is a strategy that complements the conventional 
approach of developing new drugs. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly 
prevalent type of liver cancer, necessitating an in-depth understanding of the 
underlying molecular alterations for improved treatment. Methods: We searched 
for a vast array of microarray experiments in addition to RNA-seq data. Through 
rigorous filtering processes, we have identified highly representative 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor and non-tumor liver tissues 
and identified a distinct class of possible new candidate drugs. Results: 
Functional enrichment analysis revealed distinct biological processes associated 
with metal ions, including zinc, cadmium, and copper, potentially implicating 
chronic metal ion exposure in tumorigenesis. Conversely, up-regulated genes are 
associated with mitotic events and kinase activities, aligning with the 
relevance of kinases in HCC. To unravel the regulatory networks governing these 
DEGs, we employed topological analysis methods, identifying 25 hub genes and 
their regulatory transcription factors. In the pursuit of potential therapeutic 
options, we explored drug repurposing strategies based on computational 
approaches, analyzing their potential to reverse the expression patterns of key 
genes, including AURKA, CCNB1, CDK1, RRM2, and TOP2A. Potential therapeutic 
chemicals are alvocidib, AT-7519, kenpaullone, PHA-793887, JNJ-7706621, 
danusertibe, doxorubicin and analogues, mitoxantrone, podofilox, teniposide, and 
amonafide. Conclusion: This multi-omic study offers a comprehensive view of DEGs 
in HCC, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing 
opportunities.

Like other forms of neuropathology, gliomas appear to spread along neural 
pathways. Accordingly, our group and others have previously shown that brain 
network connectivity is highly predictive of glioma survival. In this study, we 
aimed to examine the molecular mechanisms of this relationship via imaging 
transcriptomics. We retrospectively obtained presurgical, T1-weighted MRI 
datasets from 669 adult patients, newly diagnosed with diffuse glioma. We 
measured brain connectivity using gray matter networks and coregistered these 
data with a transcriptomic brain atlas to determine the spatial co-localization 
between brain connectivity and expression patterns for 14 proto-oncogenes and 3 
neural network construction genes. We found that all 17 genes were significantly 
co-localized with brain connectivity (p < 0.03, corrected). The strength of 
co-localization was highly predictive of overall survival in a cross-validated 
Cox Proportional Hazards model (mean area under the curve, AUC = 0.68 +/- 0.01) 
and significantly (p < 0.001) more so for a random forest survival model (mean 
AUC = 0.97 +/- 0.06). Bayesian network analysis demonstrated direct and indirect 
causal relationships among gene-brain co-localizations and survival. Gene 
ontology analysis showed that metabolic processes were overexpressed when 
spatial co-localization between brain connectivity and gene transcription was 
highest (p < 0.001). Drug-gene interaction analysis identified 84 potential 
candidate therapies based on our findings. Our findings provide novel insights 
regarding how gene-brain connectivity interactions may affect glioma survival.

Clear cell carcinoma (CCC), endometrioid carcinoma (EC), and serous carcinoma 
(SC) are the major histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), 
whose differences in carcinogenesis are still unclear. Here, we undertake 
comprehensive proteomic profiling of 80 CCC, 79 EC, 80 SC, and 30 control 
samples. Our analysis reveals the prognostic or diagnostic value of dysregulated 
proteins and phosphorylation sites in important pathways. Moreover, protein 
co-expression network not only provides comprehensive view of biological 
features of each histological subtype, but also indicates potential prognostic 
biomarkers and progression landmarks. Notably, EOC have strong inter-tumor 
heterogeneity, with significantly different clinical characteristics, proteomic 
patterns and signaling pathway disorders in CCC, EC, and SC. Finally, we infer 
MPP7 protein as potential therapeutic target for SC, whose biological functions 
are confirmed in SC cells. Our proteomic cohort provides valuable resources for 
understanding molecular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies of 
distinct histological subtypes.

BACKGROUND: Brain metastases derived from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
represent a significant clinical problem. We aim to characterize the genomic 
landscape of brain metastases derived from NSCLC and assess clinical 
actionability.
METHODS: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and BIOSIS from inception 
to 18/19 May 2022. We extracted information on patient demographics, smoking 
status, genomic data, matched primary NSCLC, and programmed cell death ligand 1 
expression.
RESULTS: We found 72 included papers and data on 2346 patients. The most 
frequently mutated genes from our data were EGFR (n = 559), TP53 (n = 331), KRAS 
(n = 328), CDKN2A (n = 97), and STK11 (n = 72). Common missense mutations 
included EGFR L858R (n = 80) and KRAS G12C (n = 17). Brain metastases of ever 
versus never smokers had differing missense mutations in TP53 and EGFR, except 
for L858R and T790M in EGFR, which were seen in both subgroups. Of the top 10 
frequently mutated genes that had primary NSCLC data, we found 37% of the 
specific mutations assessed to be discordant between the primary NSCLC and brain 
metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to describe 
the genomic landscape of brain metastases derived from NSCLC. These results 
provide a comprehensive outline of frequently mutated genes and missense 
mutations that could be clinically actionable. These data also provide evidence 
of differing genomic landscapes between ever versus never smokers and primary 
NSCLC compared to the BM. This information could have important consequences for 
the selection and development of targeted drugs for these patients.

BACKGROUND: The uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the cervix leads to 
cervical cancer (CC), the fourth most common gynecologic cancer. So far, many 
studies have been conducted on CC; however, it is still necessary to discover 
the hub gene, key pathways, and the exact underlying mechanisms involved in 
developing this disease.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use gene expression patterns and protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network analysis to identify key pathways and druggable hub 
genes in CC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in silico analysis, 2 microarray gene expression 
datasets; GSE63514 (104 cancer and 24 normal samples), and GSE9750 (42 cancer 
and 24 normal samples) were extracted from gene expression omnibus to identify 
common differentially expressed genes between them. Gene ontology and Kyoto 
encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis were performed via the 
Enrichr database. STRING 12.0 database and CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape 3.9.1 
software were implemented to create and analyze the PPI network. Finally, 
druggable hub genes were screened.
RESULTS: Based on the degree method, 10 key genes were known as the hub genes 
after the screening of PPI networks by the CytoHubba plugin. NCAPG, KIF11, TTK, 
PBK, MELK, ASPM, TPX2, BUB1, TOP2A, and KIF2C are the key genes, of which 5 
genes (KIF11, TTK, PBK, MELK, and TOP2A) were druggable.
CONCLUSION: This research provides a novel vision for designing therapeutic 
targets in patients with CC. However, these findings should be verified through 
additional experiments.

Introduction: Target therapy for cancer cell mutation has brought attention to 
several challenges in clinical applications, including limited therapeutic 
targets, less patient benefits, and susceptibility to acquired due to their 
clear biological mechanisms and high specificity in targeting cancers with 
specific mutations. However, the identification of truly lethal synthetic lethal 
therapeutic targets for cancer cells remains uncommon, primarily due to 
compensatory mechanisms. Methods: In our pursuit of core therapeutic targets 
(CTTs) that exhibit extensive synthetic lethality in cancer and the 
corresponding potential drugs, we have developed a machine-learning model that 
utilizes multiple levels and dimensions of cancer characterization. This is 
achieved through the consideration of the transcriptional and 
post-transcriptional regulation of cancer-specific genes and the construction of 
a model that integrates statistics and machine learning. The model incorporates 
statistics such as Wilcoxon and Pearson, as well as random forest. Through WGCNA 
and network analysis, we identify hub genes in the SL network that serve as 
CTTs. Additionally, we establish regulatory networks for non-coding RNA (ncRNA) 
and drug-target interactions. Results: Our model has uncovered 7277 potential SL 
interactions, while WGCNA has identified 13 gene modules. Through network 
analysis, we have identified 30 CTTs with the highest degree in these modules. 
Based on these CTTs, we have constructed networks for ncRNA regulation and drug 
targets. Furthermore, by applying the same process to lung cancer and renal cell 
carcinoma, we have identified corresponding CTTs and potential therapeutic 
drugs. We have also analyzed common therapeutic targets among all three cancers. 
Discussion: The results of our study have broad applicability across various 
dimensions and histological data, as our model identifies potential therapeutic 
targets by learning multidimensional complex features from known synthetic 
lethal gene pairs. The incorporation of statistical screening and network 
analysis further enhances the confidence in these potential targets. Our 
approach provides novel theoretical insights and methodological support for the 
identification of CTTs and drugs in diverse types of cancer.

PURPOSE: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) worldwide. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying 
ferroptosis and immunity in DKD could aid the development of potentially 
effective therapeutics. This study aimed to perform an integrated analysis of 
ferroptosis and immune-related differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) in DKD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of samples obtained from 
patients with DKD and controls were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database. The potential differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
screened using R software, and ferroptosis immune-related differentially 
expressed genes (FIRDEGs) were extracted from the DEGs. We performed functional 
enrichment analyses, and constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, 
transcription factor (TFs)-gene networks, and gene-drug networks to explore 
their potential biological functions. Correlation analysis and receiver 
operating characteristic curves were used for evaluating the FIRDEGs. We used 
the CIBERSORT algorithm to examine the composition of immune cells and determine 
the relationship between FIRDEG signatures and immune cells. Finally, the RNA 
expression of six FIRDEGs was validated in animal kidney samples using RT-PCR.
RESULTS: We identified 80 FIRDEGs and performed their functional analyses. We 
identified six hub genes (Ccl5, Il18, Cybb, Fcgr2b, Myd88, and Ccr2) using PPI 
networks and predicted potential TF gene networks and gene-drug pairs. Immune 
cells, including M2 macrophages, resting mast cells, and gamma-delta T cells, 
were altered in DKD; the FIRDEGs (Fcgr2b, Cybb, Ccr2, and Ccl5) were closely 
correlated with the infiltration abundance of M2 macrophages and gamma-delta T 
cells. Finally, the hub genes were verified in mouse kidney samples.
CONCLUSION: We identified six hub FIRDEGs (Ccl5, Il18, Cybb, Fcgr2b, Myd88, and 
Ccr2) in DKD, and predicted the potential transcription factor gene networks and 
possible treatment targets for future research.

BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects women of reproductive age 
globally with an incidence rate of 5% - 26%. Growing evidence reports important 
roles for microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of granulosa cells (GCs) in 
PCOS.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to identify the top differentially 
expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) and their corresponding targets in hub gene-miRNA 
networks, as well as identify novel DE-miRNAs by analyzing three distinct 
microarray datasets. Additionally, functional enrichment analysis was performed 
using bioinformatics approaches. Finally, interactions between the 5 top-ranked 
hub genes and drugs were investigated.
METHODS: Using bioinformatics approaches, three GC profiles from the gene 
expression omnibus (GEO), namely gene expression omnibus series (GSE)-34526, 
GSE114419, and GSE137684, were analyzed. Targets of the top DE-miRNAs were 
predicted using the multiMiR R package, and only miRNAs with validated results 
were retrieved. Genes that were common between the "DE-miRNA prediction results" 
and the "existing tissue DE-mRNAs" were designated as differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs). Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were 
implemented for DEGs. In order to identify hub genes and hub DE-miRNAs, the 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and miRNA-mRNA interaction network 
were constructed using Cytoscape software. The drug-gene interaction database 
(DGIdb) database was utilized to identify interactions between the top-ranked 
hub genes and drugs.
RESULTS: Out of the top 20 DE-miRNAs that were retrieved from the GSE114419 and 
GSE34526 microarray datasets, only 13 of them had "validated results" through 
the multiMiR prediction method. Among the 13 DE-miRNAs investigated, only 5, 
namely hsa-miR-8085, hsa-miR-548w, hsa-miR-612, hsa-miR-1470, and hsa-miR-644a, 
demonstrated interactions with the 10 hub genes in the hub gene-miRNA networks 
in our study. Except for hsa-miR-612, the other 4 DE-miRNAs, including 
hsa-miR-8085, hsa-miR-548w, hsa-miR-1470, and hsa-miR-644a, are novel and had 
not been reported in PCOS pathogenesis before. Also, GO and pathway enrichment 
analyses identified "pathogenic E. coli infection" in the Kyoto encyclopedia of 
genes and genomes (KEGG) and "regulation of Rac1 activity" in FunRich as the top 
pathways. The drug-hub gene interaction network identified ACTB, JUN, PTEN, 
KRAS, and MAPK1 as potential targets to treat PCOS with therapeutic drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study might assist researchers in uncovering 
new biomarkers and potential therapeutic drug targets in PCOS treatment.

Digestive disorders are a significant contributor to the global burden of 
disease and seriously affect human quality of life. Research has already 
confirmed the presence of pleiotropic genetic loci among digestive disorders, 
and studies have explored shared genetic factors among pan-cancers, including 
various malignant digestive disorders. However, most cross-phenotype studies 
within the digestive tract system have been limited to a few traits, with no 
systematic coverage of common benign and malignant digestive disorders. Here, we 
analyzed data from the UK Biobank to investigate 21 digestive disorders, 
exploring the genetic correlations and causal relationships between diseases, as 
well as the common genetic factors and potential biological pathways driving 
these relationships. Our findings confirmed the extensive genetic correlation 
and causal relationship between digestive disorders, providing important 
insights into the genetic etiology, causality, disease prevention, and clinical 
treatment of diseases.

Due to its heterogeneous nature, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) 
had the worst prognosis. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel 
diagnostic and prognostic models for effective disease management. A multi-layer 
dry-lab and wet-lab methodologies were adopted in the present study to identify 
novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of HNSC. Initially, the GSE6631 gene 
microarray HNSC dataset was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database. The R language-based "limma" package was employed to identify 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HNSC and control samples. The 
Cytohubba plug-in software was used to identify the top four hub genes based on 
the degree score method. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets, Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, clinical HNSC tissue samples, HNSC cell line 
(FaDu), and normal cell line (HOK) were used to validate the expressions of hub 
genes. Moreover, additional bioinformatics analyses were performed to further 
evaluate the mechanisms of hub genes in the development of HNSC. In total, 1372 
reliable DEGs were screened from the GSE6631 dataset. Out of these DEGs, only 
based on the four up-regulated hub genes, including UBE2C (Ubiquitin-conjugating 
enzyme E2C), BUB1B (BUB1 Mitotic Checkpoint Serine/Threonine Kinase B), MCM4 
(Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 4), and KIF23 (Kinesin family 
member 23), we developed and validated a diagnostic and prognostic model for 
HNSC patients. Moreover, some interesting correlations observed between hub gene 
expression and infiltration level of immune cells may also improve our 
understanding of HNSC immunotherapy. In conclusion, we developed a novel 
diagnostic and prognostic model consisting of the UBE2C, BUB1B, MCM4, and KIF23 
genes for HNSC patients. However, the efficiency of this model needs to be 
verified through more experimental studies.

Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a prevalent and aggressive form of cancer that 
necessitates the identification of robust biomarkers for early diagnosis and 
treatment. Therefore, this project was launched to identify a few key biomarkers 
from CC and CXC chemokine families for the accurate detection of COAD. Hub gene 
identification was performed using CytoHubba analysis. Clinical samples from 
COAD patients and normal individuals were collected and subjected to appropriate 
methods for DNA and RNA extraction. The expression levels of hub genes were 
analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR), while promoter methylation analysis was conducted using targeted 
bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite-seq). Additionally, The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were utilized to validate the 
findings based on clinical samples. CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), 
CXCL12 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12), CXCL16 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 
16), and CCL25 (CC motif chemokine ligand 25) were denoted as the key hubs among 
CC and CXC chemokine families. Through RT-qPCR analysis, it was found that 
CXCL10, CXCL12, and CXCL16 were significantly up-regulated, while CCL25 was 
down-regulated in COAD patients compared to healthy controls. Later on, these 
findings were also validated using TCGA and GEO datasets consisting of COAD and 
normal control samples. Furthermore, we investigated the promoter methylation 
status of these chemokine genes in COAD patients. Our results revealed 
significant dysregulation of promoter methylation, suggesting an epigenetic 
mechanism underlying the altered expression of CXCL10, CXCL12, CXCL16, and CCL25 
in COAD. In addition to this, various additional aspects of the CCL25, CXCL10, 
CXCL12, and CXCL16 have also been uncovered in COAD during the present study. 
This study highlights the dysregulation of CXCL10, CXCL12, CXCL16, and CCL25 
chemokine members in COAD patients, emphasizing their significance as potential 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the management of this deadly disease. 
However, further investigations are warranted to elucidate the underlying 
molecular mechanisms and evaluate the clinical utility of these findings.

Penile cancer (PeCa) is a rare tumor, generally associated with socioeconomic 
conditions in low-income countries. Hence, a delay in diagnosis and treatment 
leads in more advanced tumors, to higher comorbidity, and mortality. Human 
papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been identified as one of the major risk 
factors for PeCa. In addition, viral integration sites have been related to copy 
number alterations, impacting miRNAs/mRNA interactions and, consequently, the 
molecular pathways related to them. Nonetheless, studies on differentially 
expressed miRNAs (miRDEs) in PeCa are still scarce, especially in PeCa 
associated with high-risk HPV (hrHPV). To investigate the role of these gene 
regulators in PeCa progression, 827 miRNAs (Nanostring Technologies™, Seattle, 
WA, USA) were evaluated in 22 hrHPV-associated penile squamous cell carcinomas 
and five non-tumor penile tissues. For functions of miRNAs/target genes and 
relationship with HPV we conducted an integrated analysis by Diana Tools, KEGG, 
HPVbase, and InterSPPI-HVPPI platforms. We found that 25 miRNAs of the most 
differentially expressed impact 43 top molecular pathways, of which the fatty 
acid biosynthesis pathway, prions, miRNAs in cancer and hippo signaling 
(P<1.0-325, for each) were the most statistically significant. Notably, 23 out 
of 25 are located at HPV integration sites (HPVis). MiR-1206, miR-376b-3p and 
miR-495-3p were downregulated and associated with perineural invasion. In 
addition, a comparison between advanced and early diseases revealed 143 miRDEs. 
ROC analysis of a single (miR-376a-2-5p), paired (miR-376a-2-5p, miR-551b-3p) or 
combination of five miRDEs (miR-99a-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, let-7c-5p, 
miR-342-3p) showed robust discriminatory power (AUC = 0.9; P = 0.0114, for 
each). Strikingly, miR-376a-2-5p exhibited the highest values of sensitivity and 
specificity, with 100% and 83.3%, respectively, indicating this miRNA as a 
potential prognostic marker in hrHPV-penile carcinogenesis.

Pathological placental inflammation increases the risk for several adult 
disorders, but these mediators are also expressed under homeostatic conditions, 
where their contribution to adult health outcomes is unknown. Here we define an 
inflammation-related expression signature, primarily expressed in Hofbauer cells 
of the term placenta and use expression quantitative trait loci to create a 
polygenic score (PGS) predictive of its expression. Using this PGS in the UK 
Biobank we conduct a phenome-wide association study, followed by Mendelian 
randomization and identify protective, sex-dependent effects of the placental 
module on cardiovascular and depressive outcomes. Genes differentially regulated 
by intra-amniotic infection and preterm birth are over-represented within the 
module. We also identify aspirin as a putative modulator of this 
inflammation-related signature. Our data support a model where disruption of 
placental Hofbauer cell function, due to preterm birth or prenatal infection, 
contributes to the increased risk of depression and cardiovascular disease 
observed in these individuals.

Despite recent improvements in cancer diagnostics, 2%-5% of all malignancies are 
still cancers of unknown primary (CUP), for which the tissue-of-origin (TOO) 
cannot be determined at the time of presentation. Since the primary site of 
cancer leads to the choice of optimal treatment, CUP patients pose a significant 
clinical challenge with limited treatment options. Data produced by large-scale 
cancer genomics initiatives, which aim to determine the genomic, epigenomic, and 
transcriptomic characteristics of a large number of individual patients of 
multiple cancer types, have led to the introduction of various methods that use 
machine learning to predict the TOO of cancer patients. In this review, we 
assess the reproducibility, interpretability, and robustness of results obtained 
by 20 recent studies that utilize different machine learning methods for TOO 
prediction based on RNA sequencing data, including their reported performance on 
independent data sets and identification of important features. Our review 
investigates the strengths and weaknesses of different methods, checks the 
correspondence of their results, and identifies potential issues with datasets 
used for model training and testing, assessing their potential usefulness in a 
clinical setting and suggesting future improvements.

BACKGROUND: There are no specific clinical medications that target cardiac 
fibrosis in heart failure (HF). Recent studies have shown that tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) may benefit fibrosis in various organs. However, there is 
limited research on their application in cardiac fibrosis. Axitinib, an 
FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was used to evaluate its effects on 
cardiac fibrosis and function in pressure overload-induced heart failure.
METHODS: To build a pharmacological network, the pharmacological targets of 
axitinib were first retrieved from databases and coupled with key heart failure 
gene molecules for analysis and prediction. To validate the results outlined 
above, 8-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice were orally administrated of axitinib 
(30 mg/kg) daily for 8 weeks after Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) surgery. 
Mouse cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were used as cell lines to test the 
function and mechanism of axitinib.
RESULTS: We found that the pharmacological targets of axitinib could form a 
pharmacological network with key genes involved in heart failure. The VEGFA-KDR 
pathway was found to be closely related to the differential gene expression of 
human heart-derived primary cardiomyocyte cell lines treated with axitinib, 
based on analysis of the publicly available dataset. The outcomes of animal 
experiments demonstrated that axitinib therapy greatly reduced cardiac fibrosis 
and improved TAC-induced cardiac dysfunction. Further research has shown that 
the expression of transforming growth factor-β(TGF-β) and other fibrosis genes 
was significantly reduced in vivo and in vitro.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence for the repurposing of axitinib to 
combat cardiac fibrosis, and offers new insights into the treatment of patients 
with HF.

Understanding phenotype-to-genotype relationships is a grand challenge of 21st 
century biology with translational implications. The recently proposed 
"omnigenic" model postulates that effects of genetic variation on traits are 
mediated by core-genes and -proteins whose activities mechanistically influence 
the phenotype, whereas peripheral genes encode a regulatory network that 
indirectly affects phenotypes via core gene products. Here, we develop a 
positive-unlabeled graph representation-learning ensemble-approach based on a 
nested cross-validation to predict core-like genes for diverse diseases using 
Mendelian disorder genes for training. Employing mouse knockout phenotypes for 
external validations, we demonstrate that core-like genes display several key 
properties of core genes: Mouse knockouts of genes corresponding to our most 
confident predictions give rise to relevant mouse phenotypes at rates on par 
with the Mendelian disorder genes, and all candidates exhibit core gene 
properties like transcriptional deregulation in disease and loss-of-function 
intolerance. Moreover, as predicted for core genes, our candidates are enriched 
for drug targets and druggable proteins. In contrast to Mendelian disorder genes 
the new core-like genes are enriched for druggable yet untargeted gene products, 
which are therefore attractive targets for drug development. Interpretation of 
the underlying deep learning model suggests plausible explanations for our core 
gene predictions in form of molecular mechanisms and physical interactions. Our 
results demonstrate the potential of graph representation learning for the 
interpretation of biological complexity and pave the way for studying core gene 
properties and future drug development.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a permanent, asymptomatic segmental 
dilatation of the abdominal aorta, with a high mortality risk upon rupture. 
Identification of potential key genes and pathways may help to develop curative 
drugs for AAA. We conducted RNA-seq on abdominal aortic tissues from both AAA 
patients and normal individuals as a control group. Integrated bioinformatic 
analysis was subsequently performed to comprehensively reveal potential key 
genes and pathways. A total of 1148 differential expressed genes (DEGs) (631 
up-regulated and 517 down-regulated) were identified in our study. Gene Ontology 
(GO) analysis revealed enrichment in terms related to extracellular matrix 
organization, while KEGG analysis indicated enrichment in hematopoietic cell 
lineage and ECM-receptor interaction. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
analysis revealed several candidate key genes, and differential expression of 6 
key genes (CXCL8, CCL2, PTGS2, SELL, CCR7, and CXCL1) was validated by Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) 
analysis demonstrated these genes' high discriminatory ability between AAA and 
normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry indicated that several key genes were 
highly expressed in AAA tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed 
differential distribution patterns of these identified key genes among various 
cell types. 26 potential drugs linked to our key genes were found through DGIdb. 
Overall, our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of potential key genes 
and pathways in AAA, which could pave the way for the development of curative 
pharmacological therapies.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative parkinsonian 
disorder characterized by cell-type-specific tau lesions in neurons and glia. 
Prior work uncovered transcriptome changes in human PSP brains, although their 
cell-specificity is unknown. Further, systematic data integration and 
experimental validation platforms to prioritize brain transcriptional 
perturbations as therapeutic targets in PSP are currently lacking. In this 
study, we combine bulk tissue (n = 408) and single nucleus RNAseq (n = 34) data 
from PSP and control brains with transcriptome data from a mouse tauopathy and 
experimental validations in Drosophila tau models for systematic discovery of 
high-confidence expression changes in PSP with therapeutic potential. We 
discover, replicate, and annotate thousands of differentially expressed genes in 
PSP, many of which reside in glia-enriched co-expression modules and cells. We 
prioritize DDR2, STOM, and KANK2 as promising therapeutic targets in PSP with 
striking cross-species validations. We share our findings and data via our 
interactive application tool PSP RNAseq Atlas ( 
https://rtools.mayo.edu/PSP_RNAseq_Atlas/ ). Our findings reveal robust glial 
transcriptome changes in PSP, provide a cross-species systems biology approach, 
and a tool for therapeutic target discoveries in PSP with potential application 
in other neurodegenerative diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients are at risk during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely 
understood. This study sought to analyze the potential molecular connections 
between COVID-19 and SLE, employing a bioinformatics approach to identify 
effective drugs for both conditions.
METHODS: The data sets GSE100163 and GSE183071 were utilized to determine share 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were later analyzed by various 
bioinformatic methods, including functional enrichment, protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network analysis, regulatory network construction, and 
gene-drug interaction construction.
RESULTS: A total of 50 common DEGs were found between COVID-19 and SLE. Gene 
ontology (GO) functional annotation revealed that "immune response," "innate 
immune response," "plasma membrane," and "protein binding" were most enriched 
in. Additionally, the pathways that were enriched include "Th1 and Th2 cell 
differentiation." The study identified 48 genes/nodes enriched with 292 edges in 
the PPI network, of which the top 10 hub genes were CD4, IL7R, CD3E, CD5, CD247, 
KLRB1, CD40LG, CD7, CR2, and GZMK. Furthermore, the study found 48 transcription 
factors and 8 microRNAs regulating these hub genes. Finally, four drugs namely 
ibalizumab (targeted to CD4), blinatumomab (targeted to CD3E), muromonab-CD3 
(targeted to CD3E), and catumaxomab (targeted to CD3E) were found in gene-drug 
interaction.
CONCLUSION: Four possible drugs that targeted two specific genes, which may be 
beneficial for COVID-19 patients with SLE.

Migraine is a complex neurovascular disease with a range of severity and 
symptoms, yet mostly studied as one phenotype in genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS). Here we combine large GWAS datasets from six European populations to 
study the main migraine subtypes, migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without 
aura (MO). We identified four new MA-associated variants (in PRRT2, PALMD, ABO 
and LRRK2) and classified 13 MO-associated variants. Rare variants with large 
effects highlight three genes. A rare frameshift variant in brain-expressed 
PRRT2 confers large risk of MA and epilepsy, but not MO. A burden test of rare 
loss-of-function variants in SCN11A, encoding a neuron-expressed sodium channel 
with a key role in pain sensation, shows strong protection against migraine. 
Finally, a rare variant with cis-regulatory effects on KCNK5 confers large 
protection against migraine and brain aneurysms. Our findings offer new insights 
with therapeutic potential into the complex biology of migraine and its 
subtypes.

MOTIVATION: The reconstruction of small key regulatory networks that explain the 
differences in the development of cell (sub)types from single-cell RNA 
sequencing is a yet unresolved computational problem.
RESULTS: To this end, we have developed SCANet, an all-in-one package for 
single-cell profiling that covers the whole differential mechanotyping workflow, 
from inference of trait/cell-type-specific gene co-expression modules, driver 
gene detection, and transcriptional gene regulatory network reconstruction to 
mechanistic drug repurposing candidate prediction. To illustrate the power of 
SCANet, we examined data from two studies. First, we identify the drivers of the 
mechanotype of a cytokine storm associated with increased mortality in patients

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia. 
Currently, there are no effective disease-modifying treatments for AD. Mendelian 
randomisation (MR) has been widely used to repurpose licensed drugs and discover 
novel therapeutic targets. Thus, we aimed to identify novel therapeutic targets 
for AD and analyse their pathophysiological mechanisms and potential side 
effects.
METHODS: A two-sample MR integrating the identified druggable genes was 
performed to estimate the causal effects of blood and brain druggable expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) on AD. A repeat study was conducted using 
different blood and brain eQTL data sources to validate the identified genes. 
Using AD markers with available genome-wide association studies data, we 
evaluated the causal relationship between established AD markers to explore 
possible mechanisms. Finally, the potential side effects of the druggable genes 
for AD treatment were assessed using a phenome-wide MR.
RESULTS: Overall, 5883 unique druggable genes were aggregated; 33 unique 
potential druggable genes for AD were identified in at least one dataset (brain 
or blood), and 5 were validated in a different dataset. Among them, three prior 
druggable genes (epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2), SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11) reached 
significant levels in both blood and brain tissues. EPHX2 may mediate the 
pathogenesis of AD by affecting the entire hippocampal volume. Further 
phenome-wide MR analysis revealed no potential side effects of treatments 
targeting EPHX2, SERPINB1 or SIGLEC11.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides genetic evidence supporting the potential 
therapeutic benefits of targeting the three druggable genes for AD treatment, 
which will be useful for prioritising AD drug development.

AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are two of the most 
common diseases in elderly population and they have a high rate of comorbidity. 
Study has revealed that T2D is a major risk factor of AD, and thus exploring 
therapeutic approaches that can target both diseases has drawn much interest in 
recent years. In this study, we tried to explore drugs that could be potentially 
used to prevent or treat both AD and T2D via a drug repositioning approach.
METHODS: We first searched the known drugs that may be effective to T2D 
treatment based on the network distance between the T2D-associated genes and 
drugs deposited in the DrugBank database. Then, via molecular docking, we 
further screened these drugs by examining their interaction with islet amyloid 
polypeptide (IAPP) and Aβ42 peptide, the key components involved in the 
pathogenesis of T2D or AD. Finally, the binding between the selected drug 
candidates and the target proteins was verified by molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation; and the potential function of the drug candidates and the 
corresponding targets were analyzed.
RESULTS: From multiple resources, 734 T2D-associated genes were collected, and a 
list of 1109 drug candidates for T2D was obtained. We found that hypericin had 
the lowest binding energy and the most stable interaction with either IAPP or 
Aβ42 peptide. In addition, we also found that the target genes regulated by 
hypericin were differentially expressed in the tissues related to the two 
diseases.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that hypericin may be able to bind with IAPP and 
Aβ42 stably and prevent their accumulation, and thus could be a promising drug 
candidate for treating the comorbidity of AD and T2D.

BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis is a newly defined form of programmed cell death and 
plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This study aimed 
to integrate bioinformatics techniques to explore biomarkers to support the 
correlation between ferroptosis and AD. In addition, further investigation of 
ferroptosis-related biomarkers was conducted on the transcriptome 
characteristics in the asymptomatic AD (AsymAD).
METHODS: The microarray datasets GSE118553, GSE132903, GSE33000, and GSE157239 
on AD were downloaded from the GEO database. The list of ferroptosis-related 
genes was extracted from the FerrDb website. Differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were identified by R "limma" package and used to screen 
ferroptosis-related hub genes. The random forest algorithm was used to construct 
the diagnostic model through hub genes. The immune cell infiltration was also 
analyzed by CIBERSORTx. The miRNet and DGIdb database were used to identify 
microRNAs (miRNAs) and drugs which targeting hub genes.
RESULTS: We identified 18 ferroptosis-related hub genes anomalously expressed in 
AD, and consistent expression trends had been observed in both AsymAD The random 
forest diagnosis model had good prediction results in both training set 
(AUC = 0.824) and validation set (AUC = 0.734). Immune cell infiltration was 
analyzed and the results showed that CD4+ T cells resting memory, macrophages M2 
and neutrophils were significantly higher in AD. A significant correlation of 
hub genes with immune infiltration was observed, such as DDIT4 showed strong 
positive correlation with CD4+ T cells memory resting and AKR1C2 had positive 
correlation with Macrophages M2. Additionally, the microRNAs (miRNAs) and drugs 
which targeting hub genes were screened.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ferroptosis-related hub genes we screened 
played a part in the pathological progression of AD. We explored the potential 
of these genes as diagnostic markers and their relevance to immune cells which 
will help in understanding the development of AD. Targeting miRNAs and drugs 
provides new research clues for preventing the development of AD.

Refractoriness to initial chemotherapy and relapse after remission are the main 
obstacles to cure in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Biomarker 
guided risk stratification and targeted therapy have the potential to improve 
outcomes in high-risk T-ALL; however, cellular and genetic factors contributing 
to treatment resistance remain unknown. Previous bulk genomic studies in T-ALL 
have implicated tumor heterogeneity as an unexplored mechanism for treatment 
failure. To link tumor subpopulations with clinical outcome, we created an atlas 
of healthy pediatric hematopoiesis and applied single-cell multiomic 
(CITE-seq/snATAC-seq) analysis to a cohort of 40 cases of T-ALL treated on the 
Children's Oncology Group AALL0434 clinical trial. The cohort was carefully 
selected to capture the immunophenotypic diversity of T-ALL, with early T-cell 
precursor (ETP) and Near/Non-ETP subtypes represented, as well as enriched with 
both relapsed and treatment refractory cases. Integrated analyses of T-ALL 
blasts and normal T-cell precursors identified a bone-marrow progenitor-like 
(BMP-like) leukemia sub-population associated with treatment failure and poor 
overall survival. The single-cell-derived molecular signature of BMP-like blasts 
predicted poor outcome across multiple subtypes of T-ALL within two independent 
patient cohorts using bulk RNA-sequencing data from over 1300 patients. We 
defined the mutational landscape of BMP-like T-ALL, finding that NOTCH1 
mutations additively drive T-ALL blasts away from the BMP-like state. We 
transcriptionally matched BMP-like blasts to early thymic seeding progenitors 
that have low NR3C1 expression and high stem cell gene expression, corresponding 
to a corticosteroid and conventional cytotoxic resistant phenotype we observed 
in ex vivo drug screening. To identify novel targets for BMP-like blasts, we 
performed in silico and in vitro drug screening against the BMP-like signature 
and prioritized BMP-like overexpressed cell-surface (CD44, ITGA4, LGALS1) and 
intracellular proteins (BCL-2, MCL-1, BTK, NF-κB) as candidates for precision 
targeted therapy. We established patient derived xenograft models of BMP-high 
and BMP-low leukemias, which revealed vulnerability of BMP-like blasts to 
apoptosis-inducing agents, TEC-kinase inhibitors, and proteasome inhibitors. Our 
study establishes the first multi-omic signatures for rapid risk-stratification 
and targeted treatment of high-risk T-ALL.

Human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (HIVE) is a severe neurological 
complication after HIV infection. Evidence shows that genetic factors play an 
important role in HIVE. The aim of the present study was to identify new 
potential therapeutic targets for HIVE. Differentially expressed gene (DEG), 
functional annotation and pathway, and protein-protein interaction analyses were 
performed to identify the hub genes associated with HIVE. Gene co-expression 
analysis was carried out to confirm the association between the hub genes and 
HIVE. Finally, the role of the hub genes in HIVE therapy was evaluated by 
conducting drug-gene interaction analysis. A total of 20 overlapping DEGs 
closely related to HIVE were identified. Functional annotation and pathway 
enrichment analysis indicated that the markedly enriched DEG terms included ion 
transport, type II interferon signaling, and synaptic signaling. Moreover, 
protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that 10 key HIVE-related genes 
were hub genes, including SCN8A, CDK5R2, GRM5, SCN2B, IFI44L, STAT1, SLC17A7, 
ISG15, FGF12, and FGF13. Furthermore, six hub genes were co-expressed with 
HIVE-associated host genes in human brain tissue. Finally, three hub genes 
(STAT1, ISG15, and SCN2B) interacted with several inflammation-associated drugs. 
These findings suggested that SCN8A, CDK5R2, GRM5, SCN2B, IFI44L, STAT1, 
SLC17A7, ISG15, FGF12, and FGF13 may be new targets for diagnosis and therapy of 
HIVE.

BACKGROUND: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an exceptionally aggressive malignant 
neoplasm that arises from either the germinal center or post-germinal center B 
cells. Patients with BL often present with rapid tumor growth and require 
high-intensity multi-drug therapy combined with adequate intrathecal 
chemotherapy prophylaxis, however, a standard treatment program for BL has not 
yet been established. It is important to identify biomarkers for predicting the 
prognosis of BLs and discriminating patients who might benefit from the therapy. 
Microarray data and sequencing information from public databases could offer 
opportunities for the discovery of new diagnostic or therapeutic targets.
AIM: To identify hub genes and perform gene ontology (GO) and survival analysis 
in BL.
METHODS: Gene expression profiles and clinical traits of BL patients were 
collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to construct gene co-expression modules, 
and the cytoHubba tool was used to find the hub genes. Then, the hub genes were 
analyzed using GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. 
Additionally, a Protein-Protein Interaction network and a Genetic Interaction 
network were constructed. Prognostic candidate genes were identified through 
overall survival analysis. Finally, a nomogram was established to assess the 
predictive value of hub genes, and drug-gene interactions were also constructed.
RESULTS: In this study, we obtained 8 modules through WGCNA analysis, and there 
was a significant correlation between the yellow module and age. Then we 
identified 10 hub genes (SRC, TLR4, CD40, STAT3, SELL, CXCL10, IL2RA, IL10RA, 
CCR7 and FCGR2B) by cytoHubba tool. Within these hubs, two genes were found to 
be associated with OS (CXCL10, P = 0.029 and IL2RA, P = 0.0066) by survival 
analysis. Additionally, we combined these two hub genes and age to build a 
nomogram. Moreover, the drugs related to IL2RA and CXCL10 might have a potential 
therapeutic role in relapsed and refractory BL.
CONCLUSION: From WGCNA and survival analysis, we identified CXCL10 and IL2RA 
that might be prognostic markers for BL.

BACKGROUND: More than 200 asthma-associated genetic variants have been 
identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTL) data resources can help identify causal genes of the GWAS 
signals, but it can be difficult to find an eQTL that reflects the disease state 
because most eQTL data are obtained from normal healthy subjects.
METHODS: We performed a blood eQTL analysis using transcriptomic and genotypic 
data from 433 Korean asthma patients. To identify asthma-related genes, we 
carried out colocalization, Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) 
analysis, and Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) using the results of 
asthma GWASs and eQTL data. In addition, we compared the results of disease eQTL 
data and asthma-related genes with two normal blood eQTL data from 
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and a Japanese study.
RESULTS: We identified 340,274 cis-eQTL and 2,875 eGenes from asthmatic eQTL 
analysis. We compared the disease eQTL results with GTEx and a Japanese study 
and found that 64.1% of the 2,875 eGenes overlapped with the GTEx eGenes and 
39.0% with the Japanese eGenes. Following the integrated analysis of the 
asthmatic eQTL data with asthma GWASs, using colocalization and SMR methods, we 
identified 15 asthma-related genes specific to the Korean asthmatic eQTL data.
CONCLUSIONS: We provided Korean asthmatic cis-eQTL data and identified 
asthma-related genes by integrating them with GWAS data. In addition, we 
suggested these asthma-related genes as therapeutic targets for asthma. We 
envisage that our findings will contribute to understanding the etiological 
mechanisms of asthma and provide novel therapeutic targets.

Ferroptosis has emerged as a significant factor in the development of 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Nevertheless, our understanding of the 
potential involvement of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in BPD remains 
incomplete. In this study, we leveraged the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database to investigate this aspect. We identified 20 differentially expressed 
FRGs that are associated with BPD, shedding light on their potential role in the 
condition.LASSO along with SVM-RFE algorithms found that 12 genes: MEG3, ACSL1, 
DPP4, GALNT14, MAPK14, CD82, SMPD1, NR1D1, PARP3, ACVR1B, H19, and SLC7A11 were 
closely related to ferroptosis modulation and immunological response. These 
genes were used to create a nomogram with good predictive power and were found 
to be involved in BPD-linked pathways. In addition, the marker genes-based 
prediction model performed well in external validation data sets. The study also 
showed a significance between BPD and control samples in terms of immune cell 
infiltration. These findings may help improve our understanding of FRGs in BPD 
and lead to the development of more effective immunotherapies.

OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy is a cornerstone of breast cancer therapy, but 
radiotherapy resistance is a major clinical challenge. Herein, we show a 
molecular classification approach for estimating individual responses to 
radiotherapy.
METHODS: Consensus clustering was adopted to classify radiotherapy-sensitive and 
-resistant clusters in the TCGA-BRCA cohort based upon prognostic differentially 
expressed radiotherapy response-related genes (DERRGs). The stability of the 
classification was proven in the GSE58812 cohort via NTP method and the 
reliability was further verified by quantitative RT-PCR analyses of DERRGs. A 
Riskscore system was generated through Least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) analysis, and verified in the GSE58812 and GSE17705. Treatment 
response and anticancer immunity were evaluated via multiple well-established 
computational approaches.
RESULTS: We classified breast cancer patients as radiotherapy-sensitive and 
-resistant clusters, namely C1 and C2, also verified by quantitative RT-PCR 
analyses of DERRGs. Two clusters presented heterogeneous clinical traits, with 
poorer prognosis, older age, more advanced T, and more dead status in the C2. 
The C1 tumors had higher activity of reactive oxygen species and response to 
X-ray, proving better radiotherapeutic response. Stronger anticancer immunity 
was found in the C1 tumors that had rich immune cell infiltration, similar 
expression profiling to patients who responded to anti-PD-1, and activated 
immunogenic cell death and ferroptosis. The Riskscore was proposed for improving 
patient prognosis. High Riskscore samples had lower radiotherapeutic response 
and stronger DNA damage repair as well as poor anticancer immunity, while low 
Riskscore samples were more sensitive to docetaxel, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel.
CONCLUSION: Our findings propose a novel radiotherapy response classification 
system based upon molecular profiles for estimating radiosensitivity for 
individual breast cancer patients, and elucidate a methodological advancement 
for synergy of radiotherapy with ICB.

We developed a computational framework that integrates Genome-Wide Association 
Studies (GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses, designed to facilitate drug repurposing 
for COVID-19 treatment. The comprehensive approach combines transcriptomic-wide 
associations, polygenic priority scoring, 3D genomics, viral-host 
protein-protein interactions, and small-molecule docking. Through GWAS, we 
identified nine druggable host genes associated with COVID-19 severity and 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, all of which show differential expression in COVID-19 
patients. These genes include IFNAR1, IFNAR2, TYK2, IL10RB, CXCR6, CCR9, and 
OAS1. We performed an extensive molecular docking analysis of these targets 
using 553 small molecules derived from five therapeutically enriched categories, 
namely antibacterials, antivirals, antineoplastics, immunosuppressants, and 
anti-inflammatories. This analysis, which comprised over 20,000 individual 
docking analyses, enabled the identification of several promising drug 
candidates. All results are available via the DockCoV2 database 
(https://dockcov2.org/drugs/). The computational framework ultimately identified 
nine potential drug candidates: Peginterferon alfa-2b, Interferon alfa-2b, 
Interferon beta-1b, Ruxolitinib, Dactinomycin, Rolitetracycline, Irinotecan, 
Vinblastine, and Oritavancin. While its current focus is on COVID-19, our 
proposed computational framework can be applied more broadly to assist in drug 
repurposing efforts for a variety of diseases. Overall, this study underscores 
the potential of human genetic studies and the utility of a computational 
framework for drug repurposing in the context of COVID-19 treatment, providing a 
valuable resource for researchers in this field.

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and patients with tumors from different 
organs can share similar epigenetic and genetic alterations. Therefore, it is 
crucial to identify the novel subgroups of patients with similar molecular 
characteristics. It is possible to propose a better treatment strategy when the 
heterogeneity of the patient is accounted for during subgroup identification, 
irrespective of the tissue of origin. This work proposes a machine learning (ML) 
based pipeline for subgroup identification in pan-cancer. Here, mRNA, miRNA, DNA 
methylation, and protein expression features from pan-cancer samples were 
concatenated and non-linearly projected to a lower dimension using an ML 
algorithm. This data was then clustered to identify multi-omics-based novel 
subgroups. The clinical characterization of these ML subgroups indicated 
significant differences in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) 
(p-value<0.0001). The subgroups formed by the patients from different tumors 
shared similar molecular alterations in terms of immune microenvironment, 
mutation profile, and enriched pathways. Further, decision-level and 
feature-level fused classification models were built to identify the novel 
subgroups for unseen samples. Additionally, the classification models were used 
to obtain the class labels for the validation samples, and the molecular 
characteristics were verified. To summarize, this work identified novel ML 
subgroups using multi-omics data and showed that the patients with different 
tumor types could be similar molecularly. We also proposed and validated the 
classification models for subgroup identification. The proposed classification 
models can be used to identify the novel multi-omics subgroups, and the 
molecular characteristics of each subgroup can be used to design appropriate 
treatment regimen.

BACKGROUND: At present, the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has not been fully 
elucidated, and the diagnosis and treatment face great challenges. Cuproptosis 
is a novel cell death pattern that might be involved in the development of 
atherosclerosis. However, no research has reported the correlation between 
cuproptosis and atherosclerosis.
METHODS: The differential cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) between 
atherosclerosis group and control group (A-CRGs) were discovered via 
differential expression analysis. The correlation analysis, PPI network 
analysis, GO, KEGG and GSEA analysis were performed to investigate the function 
of A-CRGs. The differences of biological function between atherosclerosis group 
and control group were investigated via immune infiltration analysis and GSVA. 
The LASSO regression, nomogram and machine learning models were constructed to 
predict atherosclerosis risk. The atherosclerosis molecular subtypes clusters 
were discovered via unsupervised cluster analysis. Subsequently, we used the 
above research methods to analyze the differential CRGs between clusters 
(M-CRGs) and evaluate the molecular subtypes identification performance of 
M-CRGs. Finally, we verified the diagnostic value for atherosclerosis and role 
in cuproptosis of these CRGs through the validation set and in vitro 
experiments.
RESULTS: Five A-CRGs were identified and they were mainly related to the 
biological function of copper ion metabolism and immune inflammatory response. 
The diagnostic models and nomogram of atherosclerosis based on 5 A-CRGs 
indicated that these genes had well diagnostic value. A total of two molecular 
subtypes clusters were obtained in the atherosclerosis group. There were many 
differences in biological functions between these two molecular subtypes 
clusters, such as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and primary 
immunodeficiency. In addition, 3 M-CRGs were identified in the 2 clusters. 
Machine learning models and nomogram constructed based on M-CRGs showed that 
these genes had well molecular subtypes identification efficacy. In the end, the 
results of in vitro experiment and validation set confirmed the diagnostic value 
for atherosclerosis and role in cuproptosis of these genes.
CONCLUSION: The cuproptosis may be a potential pathogenesis of atherosclerosis 
and CRGs may be promising markers for the diagnosis and molecular subtypes 
identification of atherosclerosis.

In this study, we aimed to identify molecular markers associated with type II 
alveolar epithelial cell injury in acute lung injury (ALI) models using 
bioinformatics methods. The objective was to provide new insights for the 
diagnosis and treatment of ALI/ARDS. We downloaded RNA SEQ datasets (GSE109913, 
GSE179418, and GSE119123) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and used R 
language package to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were 
annotated using Gene Ontology (GO), and their pathways were analyzed using Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). DEGs were imported into the STRING 
database and analyzed using Cytoscape software to determine the protein network 
of DEGs and calculate the top 10 nodes for the hub genes. Finally, potential 
therapeutic drugs for the hub genes were predicted using the DGIdb database. We 
identified 78 DEGs, including 70 up-regulated genes and 8 down-regulated genes. 
GO analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly involved in biological processes 
such as granulocyte migration, response to bacterial-derived molecules, and 
cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Additionally, they had cytokine activity, 
chemokine activity, and receptor ligand activity, and functioned in related 
receptor binding, CXCR chemokine receptor binding, G protein-coupled receptor 
binding, and other molecular functions. KEGG analysis indicated that the DEGs 
were mainly involved in TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, NF-κB 
signal pathway, chemokine signal pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction 
signal pathway, and others. We identified eight hub genes, including IRF7, 
IFIT1, IFIT3, PSMB8, PSMB9, BST2, OASL2, and ZBP1, which were all up-regulated 
genes. We identified several hub genes of type II alveolar epithelial cells in 
ALI mouse models using bioinformatics analysis. These results provide new 
targets for understanding and treating of ALI.

Targeted therapies are effective in treating cancer, but success depends on 
identifying cancer vulnerabilities. In our study, we utilize small RNA 
sequencing to examine the impact of pathway activation on microRNA (miRNA) 
expression patterns. Interestingly, we discover that miRNAs capable of 
inhibiting key members of activated pathways are frequently diminished. Building 
on this observation, we develop an approach that integrates a 
low-miRNA-expression signature to identify druggable target genes in cancer. We 
train and validate our approach in colorectal cancer cells and extend it to 
diverse cancer models using patient-derived in vitro and in vivo systems. 
Finally, we demonstrate its additional value to support genomic and 
transcriptomic-based drug prediction strategies in a pan-cancer patient cohort 
from the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT)/German Cancer Consortium 
(DKTK) Molecularly Aided Stratification for Tumor Eradication (MASTER) precision 
oncology trial. In conclusion, our strategy can predict cancer vulnerabilities 
with high sensitivity and accuracy and might be suitable for future therapy 
recommendations in a variety of cancer subtypes.

Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) and other targeted protein degradation 
(TPD) molecules that induce degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) 
offer new opportunities to engage targets that remain challenging to be 
inhibited by conventional small molecules. One fundamental element in the 
degradation process is the E3 ligase. However, less than 2% amongst hundreds of 
E3 ligases in the human genome have been engaged in current studies in the TPD 
field, calling for the recruiting of additional ones to further enhance the 
therapeutic potential of TPD. To accelerate the development of PROTACs utilizing 
under-explored E3 ligases, we systematically characterize E3 ligases from seven 
different aspects, including chemical ligandability, expression patterns, 
protein-protein interactions (PPI), structure availability, functional 
essentiality, cellular location, and PPI interface by analyzing 30 large-scale 
data sets. Our analysis uncovers several E3 ligases as promising extant PROTACs. 
In total, combining confidence score, ligandability, expression pattern, and 
PPI, we identified 76 E3 ligases as PROTAC-interacting candidates. We develop a 
user-friendly and flexible web portal ( https://hanlaboratory.com/E3Atlas/ ) 
aimed at assisting researchers to rapidly identify E3 ligases with promising TPD 
activities against specifically desired targets, facilitating the development of 
these therapies in cancer and beyond.

BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a group of clinical syndromes of 
thrombosis or adverse pregnancy outcomes caused by antiphospholipid antibodies, 
which increase the incidence of in vitro fertilization failure in patients with 
infertility. However, the common mechanism of repeated implantation failure 
(RIF) with APS is unclear. This study aimed to search for potential diagnostic 
genes and potential therapeutic targets for RIF with APS.
METHODS: To obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we downloaded the APS 
and RIF datasets separately from the public Gene Expression Omnibus database and 
performed differential expression analysis. We then identified the common DEGs 
of APS and RIF. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
pathway enrichment analyses were performed, and we then generated 
protein-protein interaction. Furthermore, immune infiltration was investigated 
by using the CIBERSORT algorithm on the APS and RIF datasets. LASSO regression 
analysis was used to screen for candidate diagnostic genes. To evaluate the 
diagnostic value, we developed a nomogram and validated it with receiver 
operating characteristic curves, then analyzed these genes in the Comparative 
Toxicogenomics Database. Finally, the Drug Gene Interaction Database was 
searched for potential therapeutic drugs, and the interactions between drugs, 
genes, and immune cells were depicted with a Sankey diagram.
RESULTS: There were 11 common DEGs identified: four downregulated and seven 
upregulated. The common DEG analysis suggested that an imbalance of immune 
system-related cells and molecules may be a common feature in the 
pathophysiology of APS and RIF. Following validation, MARK2, CCDC71, GATA2, and 
KLRC3 were identified as candidate diagnostic genes. Finally, Acetaminophen and 
Fasudil were predicted as two candidate drugs.
CONCLUSION: Four immune-associated candidate diagnostic genes (MARK2, CCDC71, 
GATA2, and KLRC3) were identified, and a nomogram for RIF with APS diagnosis was 
developed. Our findings may aid in the investigation of potential biological 
mechanisms linking APS and RIF, as well as potential targets for diagnosis and 
treatment.

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a serious stage of chronic liver 
disease with high short-term mortality and no definitely effective treatment. 
Oxidative stress (OS) is involved in the development of ACLF. OS-related genes 
targeted therapy may provide additional assistance for the treatment of ACLF. 
ACLF related gene sets and oxidative stress-related genes (OSGs) were 
respectively downloaded from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database and 
GeneCards database for integrated bioinformatics analyses (functional 
enrichment, weighted gene co-expression network and immune cells infiltration). 
Immune-related differentially expressed oxidative stress-related genes (DEOSGs) 
in ACLF were used for construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
in which hub genes were screened out. Hub genes with consistently good 
diagnostic or prognostic value for ACLF in four gene sets were named as key 
genes. DEOSGs were significantly enriched in biological process and signaling 
pathways related to inflammation, immune response and oxidative stress. Six key 
genes (MPO, CCL5, ITGAM, TLR2, TLR4, and TIMP1) were identified and found to be 
highly correlated with immune response and metabolic process. This study 
deepened our understanding of the impact of oxidative stress on the pathogenesis 
and prognosis of ACLF and provided more insights into the prediction of 
prognosis and molecular targeted therapy in ACLF.

Frontal temporal dementia (FTD) is a neurological disorder known to have fewer 
therapeutic options. So far, only a few biomarkers are available for FTD that 
can be used as potential comorbidity targets. For example, genes such as VCP, 
which has a role in breast cancer, and WFS1, which has a role in COVID-19, are 
known to show a role in FTD as well. To this end, in the present study, we aim 
to identify potential biomarkers or susceptible genes for FTD that show 
comorbidities with diseases such as COVID-19 and breast cancer. A dataset from 
Gene Expression Omnibus containing FTD expression profiles from African American 
and white ethnicity backgrounds was included in our study. In FTD samples of the 
GSE193391 dataset, we identified 305 DEGs, with 168 genes being up-regulated and 
137 genes being down-regulated. We conducted a comorbidity analysis for COVID-19 
and breast cancer, followed by an analysis of potential drug interactions, 
pathogenicity, analysis of genetic variants, and functional enrichment analysis. 
Our results showed that the genes AKT3, GFAP, ADCYAP1R1, VDAC1, and C4A have 
significant transcriptomic alterations in FTD along with the comorbidity status 
with COVID-19 and breast cancer. Functional pathway analysis revealed that these 
comorbid genes were significantly enriched in the pathways such as glioma, 
JAK/STAT signaling, systematic lupus erythematosus, neurodegeneration-multiple 
diseases, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Overall, from these 
results, we concluded that these genes could be recommended as potential 
therapeutic targets for the treatment of comorbidities (breast cancer and 
COVID-19) in patients with FTD.

In the effort to treat Mendelian disorders, correcting the underlying molecular 
imbalance may be more effective than symptomatic treatment. Identifying 
treatments that might accomplish this goal requires extensive and up-to-date 
knowledge of molecular pathways-including drug-gene and gene-gene relationships. 
To address this challenge, we present "parsing modifiers via article 
annotations" (PARMESAN), a computational tool that searches PubMed and PubMed 
Central for information to assemble these relationships into a central knowledge 
base. PARMESAN then predicts putatively novel drug-gene relationships, assigning 
an evidence-based score to each prediction. We compare PARMESAN's drug-gene 
predictions to all of the drug-gene relationships displayed by the Drug-Gene 
Interaction Database (DGIdb) and show that higher-scoring relationship 
predictions are more likely to match the directionality (up- versus 
down-regulation) indicated by this database. PARMESAN had more than 200,000 drug 
predictions scoring above 8 (as one example cutoff), for more than 3,700 genes. 
Among these predicted relationships, 210 were registered in DGIdb and 201 (96%) 
had matching directionality. This publicly available tool provides an automated 
way to prioritize drug screens to target the most-promising drugs to test, 
thereby saving time and resources in the development of therapeutics for genetic 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) progression involves multiple factors, including 
cartilage erosion as the basic pathological mechanism of degeneration, and is 
closely related to chondrocyte apoptosis. To analyze the correlation between 
apoptosis and OA development, we selected apoptosis genes from the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OA and normal samples from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, used lasso regression analysis to 
identify characteristic genes, and performed consensus cluster analysis to 
further explore the pathogenesis of this disease.
METHODS: The Gene expression profile datasets of OA samples, GSE12021 and 
GSE55235, were downloaded from GEO. The datasets were combined and analyzed for 
DEGs. Apoptosis-related genes (ARGs) were collected from the GeneCards database 
and intersected with DEGs for apoptosis-related DEGs (ARDEGs). Least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was performed to 
obtain characteristic genes, and a nomogram was constructed based on these 
genes. A consensus cluster analysis was performed to divide the patients into 
clusters. The immune characteristics, functional enrichment, and immune 
infiltration statuses of the clusters were compared. In addition, a 
protein-protein interaction network of mRNA drugs, mRNA-transcription factors 
(TFs), and mRNA-miRNAs was constructed.
RESULTS: A total of 95 DEGs were identified, of which 47 were upregulated and 48 
were downregulated, and 31 hub genes were selected as ARDEGs. LASSO regression 
analysis revealed nine characteristic genes: growth differentiation factor 15 
(GDF15), NAMPT, TLR7, CXCL2, KLF2, REV3L, KLF9, THBD, and MTHFD2. Clusters A and 
B were identified, and neutrophil activation and neutrophil activation involved 
in the immune response were highly enriched in Cluster B, whereas protein repair 
and purine salvage signal pathways were enriched in Cluster A. The number of 
activated natural killer cells in Cluster B was significantly higher than that 
in Cluster A. GDF15 and KLF9 interacted with 193 and 32 TFs, respectively, and 
CXCL2 and REV3L interacted with 48 and 82 miRNAs, respectively.
CONCLUSION: ARGs could predict the occurrence of OA and may be related to 
different degrees of OA progression.

OBJECTIVE: Suicidal behavior is heritable and is a major cause of death 
worldwide. Two large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) recently 
discovered and cross-validated genome-wide significant (GWS) loci for suicide 
attempt (SA). The present study leveraged the genetic cohorts from both studies 
to conduct the largest GWAS meta-analysis of SA to date. Multi-ancestry and 
admixture-specific meta-analyses were conducted within groups of significant 
African, East Asian, and European ancestry admixtures.
METHODS: This study comprised 22 cohorts, including 43,871 SA cases and 915,025 
ancestry-matched controls. Analytical methods across multi-ancestry and 
individual ancestry admixtures included inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects 
meta-analyses, followed by gene, gene-set, tissue-set, and drug-target 
enrichment, as well as summary-data-based Mendelian randomization with brain 
expression quantitative trait loci data, phenome-wide genetic correlation, and 
genetic causal proportion analyses.
RESULTS: Multi-ancestry and European ancestry admixture GWAS meta-analyses 
identified 12 risk loci at p values <5×10-8. These loci were mostly intergenic 
and implicated DRD2, SLC6A9, FURIN, NLGN1, SOX5, PDE4B, and CACNG2. The 
multi-ancestry SNP-based heritability estimate of SA was 5.7% on the liability 
scale (SE=0.003, p=5.7×10-80). Significant brain tissue gene expression and drug 
set enrichment were observed. There was shared genetic variation of SA with 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, smoking, and risk tolerance after 
conditioning SA on both major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress 
disorder. Genetic causal proportion analyses implicated shared genetic risk for 
specific health factors.
CONCLUSIONS: This multi-ancestry analysis of suicide attempt identified several 
loci contributing to risk and establishes significant shared genetic covariation 
with clinical phenotypes. These findings provide insight into genetic factors 
associated with suicide attempt across ancestry admixture populations, in 
veteran and civilian populations, and in attempt versus death.

Prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) correlates significantly with a surge in adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, yet its pathological mechanisms remain partially unexplored. 
This study aims to meticulously examine the repercussions of PTE on placental 
immune landscapes, employing a coordinated research methodology encompassing 
bioinformatics, machine learning and animal studies. Concurrently, it aims to 
screen biomarkers and potential compounds that could sensitively indicate and 
mitigate placental immune disorders. In the course of this research, two gene 
expression omnibus (GEO) microarrays, namely GSE27272 and GSE7434, were 
included. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and immune enrichment 
investigations on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated that PTE might 
perturb numerous innate or adaptive immune-related biological processes. A 
cohort of 52 immune-associated DEGs was acquired by cross-referencing the DEGs 
with gene sets derived from the ImmPort database. A protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network was subsequently established, from which 10 hub genes were 
extracted using the maximal clique centrality (MCC) algorithm (JUN, NPY, SST, 
FLT4, FGF13, HBEGF, NR0B2, AREG, NR1I2, SEMA5B). Moreover, we substantiated the 
elevated affinity of tobacco reproductive toxicants, specifically nicotine and 
nitrosamine, with hub genes through molecular docking (JUN, FGF13 and NR1I2). 
This suggested that these genes could potentially serve as crucial loci for 
tobacco's influence on the placental immune microenvironment. To further 
elucidate the immune microenvironment landscape, consistent clustering analysis 
was conducted, yielding three subtypes, where the abundance of follicular helper 
T cells (p < 0.05) in subtype A, M2 macrophages (p < 0.01), neutrophils 
(p < 0.05) in subtype B and CD8+ T cells (p < 0.05), resting NK cells 
(p < 0.05), M2 macrophages (p < 0.05) in subtype C were significantly different 
from the control group. Additionally, three pivotal modules, designated as red, 
blue and green, were identified, each bearing a close association with 
differentially infiltrated immunocytes, as discerned by the weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Functional enrichment analysis was 
subsequently conducted on these modules. To further probe into the mechanisms by 
which immune-associated DEGs are implicated in intercellular communication, 20 
genes serving as ligands or receptors and connected to differentially 
infiltrating immunocytes were isolated. Employing a variety of machine learning 
techniques, including one-way logistic regression, LASSO regression, random 
forest and artificial neural networks, we screened 11 signature genes from the 
intersection of immune-associated DEGs and secretory protein-encoding genes 
derived from the Human Protein Atlas. Notably, CCL18 and IFNA4 emerged as 
prospective peripheral blood markers capable of identifying PTE-induced immune 
disorders. These markers demonstrated impressive predictive power, as indicated 
by the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.713 (0.548-0.857) and 0.780 
(0.618-0.914), respectively. Furthermore, we predicted 34 potential compounds, 
including cyclosporine, oestrogen and so on, which may engage with hub genes and 
attenuate immune disorders instigated by PTE. The diagnostic performance of 
these biomarkers, alongside the interventional effect of cyclosporine, was 
further corroborated in animal studies via ELISA, Western blot and 
immunofluorescence assays. In summary, this study identifies a disturbance in 
the placental immune landscape, a secondary effect of PTE, which may underlie 
multiple pregnancy complications. Importantly, our research contributes to the 
noninvasive and timely detection of PTE-induced placental immune disorders, 
while also offering innovative therapeutic strategies for their treatment.

The miR-200b/429 located at 1p36 is a highly conserved miRNA cluster emerging as 
a critical regulator of cervical cancer. Using publicly available miRNA 
expression data from TCGA and GEO followed by independent validation, we aimed 
to identify the association between miR-200b/429 expression and cervical cancer. 
miR-200b/429 cluster was significantly overexpressed in cancer samples compared 
to normal samples. miR-200b/429 expression did not correlate with patient 
survival; however, its overexpression correlated with histological type. 
Protein-protein interaction analysis of 90 target genes of miR-200b/429 
identified EZH2, FLT1, IGF2, IRS1, JUN, KDR, SOX2, MYB, ZEB1, and TIMP2 as the 
top ten hub genes. PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways emerged as major target 
pathways of miR-200b/429 and their hub genes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
showed the expression of seven miR-200b/429 target genes (EZH2, FLT1, IGF2, 
IRS1, JUN, SOX2, and TIMP2) to influence the overall survival of patients. The 
miR-200a-3p and miR-200b-5p could help predict cervical cancer with metastatic 
potential. The cancer hallmark enrichment analysis showed hub genes to promote 
growth, sustained proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, induction of 
angiogenesis, activation of invasion, and metastasis, enabling replicative 
immortality, evading immune destruction, and tumor-promoting inflammation. The 
drug-gene interaction analysis identified 182 potential drugs to interact with 
27 target genes of miR-200b/429 with paclitaxel, doxorubicin, dabrafenib, 
bortezomib, docetaxel, ABT-199, eribulin, vorinostat, etoposide, and 
mitoxantrone emerging as the top ten best candidate drugs. Taken together, 
miR-200b/429 and associated hub genes can be helpful for prognostic application 
and clinical management of cervical cancer.

Lung cancer is the primary and third most frequently detected form of cancer in 
both males and females. The present study tries to perform integrated analysis 
in male as well as female patients inclusively both smoker and non-smokers. This 
study aims to identify diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung 
cancer patients using human microarray profile datasets. Differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using a PPI network from the String 
database, and major modules or clusters were extracted using MCODE. The 
Cytohubba plug-in was used to find hub genes from the PPI network using 
centralities approaches. Twenty significant hub genes (CCND1, CDK1, CCNB1, CDH1, 
TP53, CTNNB1, EGFR, ESR1, CDK2, CCNA2, RHOA, EGF, FN1, HSP90AA1, STAT3, JUN, 
NOTCH1, IL6, SRC, and CD44) were identified as promising diagnostic biomarkers 
and therapeutic targets for lung cancer treatment. Survival analysis and hub 
gene validation were also conducted. GO enrichment and pathway analysis were 
conducted to identify their important functions. These hub genes were also used 
to identify targeted drugs. The findings suggest that the identified genes have 
the potential to be used as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for 
lung cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Super-enhancers (SEs), which activate genes involved in cell-type 
specificity, have mainly been defined as genomic regions with top-ranked 
enrichment(s) of histone H3 with acetylated K27 (H3K27ac) and/or transcription 
coactivator(s) including a bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family 
protein, BRD4. However, BRD4 preferentially binds to multi-acetylated histone 
H4, typically with acetylated K5 and K8 (H4K5acK8ac), leading us to hypothesize 
that SEs should be defined by high H4K5acK8ac enrichment at least as well as by 
that of H3K27ac.
RESULTS: Here, we conducted genome-wide profiling of H4K5acK8ac and H3K27ac, 
BRD4 binding, and the transcriptome by using a BET inhibitor, JQ1, in three 
human glial cell lines. When SEs were defined as having the top ranks for 
H4K5acK8ac or H3K27ac signal, 43% of H4K5acK8ac-ranked SEs were distinct from 
H3K27ac-ranked SEs in a glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) line. 
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of the H4K5acK8ac-preferred SEs associated with 
MYCN and NFIC decreased the stem-like properties in GSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data highlights H4K5acK8ac's utility for 
identifying genes regulating cell-type specificity.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cuproptosis has been identified as a key player in the 
development of several diseases. In this study, we investigate the potential 
role of cuproptosis-related genes in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD).
METHOD: The gene expression profiles of NAFLD were obtained from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus database. Differential expression of cuproptosis-related 
genes (CRGs) were determined between NAFLD and normal tissues. Protein-protein 
interaction, correlation, and function enrichment analyses were performed. 
Machine learning was used to identify hub genes. Immune infiltration was 
analyzed in both NAFLD patients and controls. Quantitative real-time PCR was 
employed to validate the expression of hub genes.
RESULTS: Four datasets containing 115 NAFLD and 106 control samples were 
included for bioinformatics analysis. Three hub CRGs (NFE2L2, DLD, and POLD1) 
were identified through the intersection of three machine learning algorithms. 
The receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted based on these three 
marker genes, and the area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.704. In the 
external GSE135251 dataset, the AUC value of the three key genes was as high as 
0.970. Further nomogram, decision curve, calibration curve analyses also 
confirmed the diagnostic predictive efficacy. Gene set enrichment analysis and 
gene set variation analysis showed these three marker genes involved in multiple 
pathways that are related to the progression of NAFLD. CIBERSORT and 
single-sample gene set enrichment analysis indicated that their expression 
levels in macrophages, mast cells, NK cells, Treg cells, resting dendritic 
cells, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were higher in NAFLD compared with 
control liver samples. The ceRNA network demonstrated a complex regulatory 
relationship between the three hub genes. The mRNA level of these hub genes were 
further confirmed in a mouse NAFLD liver samples.
CONCLUSION: Our study comprehensively demonstrated the relationship between 
NAFLD and cuproptosis, developed a promising diagnostic model, and provided 
potential targets for NAFLD treatment and new insights for exploring the 
mechanism for NAFLD.

The intricate association of oncogenic markers negatively impacts accurate 
gastric cancer diagnosis and leads to the proliferation of mortality rate. 
Molecular heterogeneity is inevitable in determining gastric cancer's 
progression state with multiple cell types involved. Identification of 
pathogenic gene signatures is imperative to understand the disease's etiology. 
This study demonstrates a systematic approach to identifying oncogenic gastric 
cancer genes linked with different cell types. The raw counts of adjacent normal 
and gastric cancer samples are subjected to a quality control step. The 
dimensionality reduction and multidimensional clustering are performed using 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and 
Projection (UMAP) techniques. The adjacent normal and gastric cancer sample cell 
clusters are annotated with the Human Primary Cell Atlas database using the 
"SingleR." Cellular state transition between the distinct groups is 
characterized using trajectory analysis. The ligand-receptor interaction between 
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and cell clusters unveils crucial 
molecular pathways in gastric cancer progression. Chondrocytes, Smooth muscle 
cells, and fibroblast cell clusters contain genes contributing to poor survival 
rates based on hazard ratio during survival analysis. The GC-related oncogenic 
signatures are isolated by comparing the gene set with the DisGeNET database. 
Twelve gastric cancer biomarkers (SPARC, KLF5, HLA-DRB1, IGFBP3, TIMP3, LGALS1, 
IGFBP6, COL18A1, F3, COL4A1, PDGFRB, COL5A2) are linked with gastric cancer and 
further validated through gene set enrichment analysis. Drug-gene interaction 
found PDGFRB, interacting with various anti-cancer drugs, as a potential 
inhibitor for gastric cancer. Further investigations on these molecular 
signatures will assist the development of precision therapeutics, promising 
longevity among gastric cancer patients.

By combining mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics with 
genomics, epi-genomics, and transcriptomics, proteogenomics provides 
comprehensive molecular characterization of cancer. Using this approach, the 
Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has characterized over 
1,000 primary tumors spanning 10 cancer types, many with matched normal tissues. 
Here, we present LinkedOmicsKB, a proteogenomics data-driven knowledge base that 
makes consistently processed and systematically precomputed CPTAC pan-cancer 
proteogenomics data available to the public through ∼40,000 gene-, protein-, 
mutation-, and phenotype-centric web pages. Visualization techniques facilitate 
efficient exploration and reasoning of complex, interconnected data. Using three 
case studies, we illustrate the practical utility of LinkedOmicsKB in providing 
new insights into genes, phosphorylation sites, somatic mutations, and cancer 
phenotypes. With precomputed results of 19,701 coding genes, 125,969 
phosphosites, and 256 genotypes and phenotypes, LinkedOmicsKB provides a 
comprehensive resource to accelerate proteogenomics data-driven discoveries to 
improve our understanding and treatment of human cancer. A record of this 
paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental 
information.

BACKGROUND: The proteome is a major source of therapeutic targets. We conducted 
a proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to identify candidate protein 
markers and therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were derived from seven 
published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on plasma proteome, and 
summary-level data were extracted for 4853 circulating protein markers. Genetic 
associations with CRC were obtained from a large-scale GWAS meta-analysis 
(16,871 cases and 26,328 controls), the FinnGen cohort (4957 cases and 304,197 
controls), and the UK Biobank (9276 cases and 477,069 controls). Colocalization 
and summary-data-based MR (SMR) analyses were performed sequentially to verify 
the causal role of candidate proteins. Single cell-type expression analysis, 
protein-protein interaction (PPI), and druggability evaluation were further 
conducted to detect the specific cell type with enrichment expression and 
prioritize potential therapeutic targets.
RESULTS: Collectively, genetically predicted levels of 13 proteins were 
associated with CRC risk. Elevated levels of two proteins (GREM1, CHRDL2) and 
decreased levels of 11 proteins were associated with an increased risk of CRC, 
among which four (GREM1, CLSTN3, CSF2RA, CD86) were prioritized with the most 
convincing evidence. These protein-coding genes are mainly expressed in tissue 
stem cells, epithelial cells, and monocytes in colon tumor tissue. Two 
interactive pairs of proteins (GREM1 and CHRDL2; MMP2 and TIMP2) were identified 
to be involved in osteoclast differentiation and tumorigenesis pathways; four 
proteins (POLR2F, CSF2RA, CD86, MMP2) have been targeted for drug development on 
autoimmune diseases and other cancers, with the potentials of being repurposed 
as therapeutic targets for CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several protein biomarkers to be associated 
with CRC risk and provided new insights into the etiology and promising targets 
for the development of screening biomarkers and therapeutic drugs for CRC.

BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive malignancy. 
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are pathogen-trapping structures in the 
tumor microenvironment that affect DLBCL progression. However, the predictive 
function of NET-related genes (NRGs) in DLBCL has received little attention. 
This study aimed to investigate the interaction between NRGs and the prognosis 
of DLBCL as well as their possible association with the immunological 
microenvironment.
METHODS: The gene expression and clinical data of patients with DLBCL were 
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We identified 148 NRGs 
through the manual collection of literature. GSE10846 (n = 400, GPL570) was used 
as the training dataset and divided into training and testing sets in a 7:3 
ratio. Univariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify overall survival 
(OS)-related NETs, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was 
used to evaluate the predictive efficacy of the NRGs. Kaplan-Meier plots were 
used to visualize survival functions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves were used to assess the prognostic predictive ability of NRG-based 
features. A nomogram containing the clinical information and prognostic scores 
of the patients was constructed using multivariate logistic regression and Cox 
proportional risk regression models.
RESULTS: We identified 36 NRGs that significantly affected patient overall 
survival (OS). Eight NRGs (PARVB, LYZ, PPARGC1A, HIF1A, SPP1, CDH1, S100A9, and 
CXCL2) were found to have excellent predictive potential for patient survival. 
For the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates, the obtained areas under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve values were 0.8, 0.82, and 0.79, respectively. In 
the training set, patients in the high NRG risk group presented a poorer 
prognosis (p < 0.0001), which was validated using two external datasets 
(GSE11318 and GSE34171). The calibration curves of the nomogram showed that it 
had excellent predictive ability. Moreover, in vitro quantitative real-time PCR 
(qPCR) results showed that the mRNA expression levels of CXCL2, LYZ, and PARVB 
were significantly higher in the DLBCL group.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a genetic risk model based on NRGs to predict the 
prognosis of patients with DLBCL, which may assist in the selection of treatment 
drugs for these patients.

BACKGROUND: Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the most prevalent type 
of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with a high incidence and mortality rate. There 
is a lack of sensitive biomarkers. Therefore, the discovery of accurate 
biomarkers for KIRC patients is critical to improve prognosis.
METHODS: We determined hub genes and their associated pathways involved in the 
pathogenesis of KIRC from the GSE66272 dataset consisting of KIRC (n = 26) and 
corresponding control (n = 26) samples and later validated the expression and 
methylation level of the identified hub genes on The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) 
datasets and Human RCC 786-O and normal HK-2 cell lines through RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq), Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR), and targeted bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite-seq) analyses.
RESULTS: The identified up-regulated four hub genes include TYROBP 
(Transmembrane Immune Signaling Adaptor TYROBP), PTPRC (Protein tyrosine 
phosphatase, receptor type, C), LCP2 (Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2), and ITGB2 
(Integrin Subunit Beta 2). Moreover, the higher expression of TYROBP, PTPRC, 
LCP2, and ITGB2 in KIRC patients insignificantly correlates with a poor 
prognosis in KIRC patients. In addition, hub genes were involved in the "Fc 
epsilon RI signaling pathway, asthma, natural cell killer mediated cytotoxicity, 
T cell receptor signaling pathway, primary immunodeficiency, Fc gamma R-mediated 
phagocytosis, malaria, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and legionellosis" 
pathways and associated with the infiltration level of CD8+ T, CD4+ T, and 
macrophage cells.
CONCLUSION: Our integrated in silico and in vitro analysis identified important 
hub genes (TYROBP, PTPRC, LCP2, and ITGB2) involved in the pathogenesis of KIRC 
as possible diagnostic biomarkers.

The rising incidence and mortality rate of Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma 
(UCEC) pose significant health concerns. CC and CXC chemokines have been linked 
to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Recognizing the growing significance of 
CC and CXC chemokines' diagnostic and prognostic significance in diverse cancer 
types, our objective was to comprehensively analyze the diagnostic and 
prognostic values of hub genes from the CC and CXC chemokines in UCEC, utilizing 
both in silico and clinical samples and cell lines-based approaches. In silico 
analyses include STRING, Cytoscape, Cytohubba, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
datasets analysis via the UALCAN, GEPIA, OncoDB, and MuTarget, SurvivalGenie, 
MEXPRESS, cBioPoratal, TIMER, ENCORI, and DrugBank. Meanwhile, clinical samples 
and cell lines based analyses include Reverse transcription-quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), targeted bisulfite sequencing 
(bisulfite-seq) analysis, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Through present study, 
we identified CCL25 (CC motif chemokine ligand 25), CXCL10 (C-X-C motif 
chemokine ligand 10), CXCL12 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12), and CXCL16 
(C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16) as crucial hub genes among the CC and CXC 
chemokines. Analyzing the expression data from TCGA, we observed a significant 
up-regulation of CCL25, CXCL10, and CXCL16 in UCEC samples compared to controls. 
In contrast, we noted a significant down-regulation of CXCL12 expression in UCEC 
samples. On clinical UCEC samples and cell lines analysis, the significant 
higher expression of CCL25, CXCL10, and CXCL16 and significant lower expression 
of CXCL12 were also denoted in UCEC samples than the controls via RT-qPCR and 
IHC analyses. Moreover, in silico analysis also confirmed the abnormal promoter 
methylation levels of the hub genes in TCGA UCEC samples, which was later 
validated by the clinical samples using targeted based bisulfite-seq analysis. 
In addition, various additional aspects of the CCL25, CXCL10, CXCL12, and CXCL16 
have also been uncovered in UCEC during the present study. Our findings offer 
novel insights that contribute to the clinical utility of CCL25, CXCL10, CXCL12, 
and CXCL16 chemokines as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in UCEC.

Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the most prevalent subtype of renal 
tumor. The underlying mechanisms governing KIRC initiation and progression are 
less known. The present study aimed to reveal novel hub genes associated with 
the initiation and progression of KIRC, which may be utilized as novel molecular 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of KIRC. The GSE6344 
dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was integrated to 
identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the limma package. Then, 
hub genes were identified and UALCAN, GEPIA, OncoDB, DriverDBv3, GENT2, and HPA 
databases were employed for the expression, survival, and methylation analyses. 
cBioPortal tool was used to investigate the genetic alterations, while 
CancerSEA, TIMER, DAVID, ENCORI, DrugBank, and GSCAlite were utilized to explore 
a few more hub gene-associated parameters. Finally, targeted bisulfite 
sequencing (bisulfite-seq), and RT-qPCR techniques were used to validate the 
expression and methylation level of the hub genes using Human RCC cell line 
786-O, A-498, and normal renal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2. In total, 7299 
DEGs were found between KIRC and normal samples in the GSE6344 dataset. Using 
STRING and Cytohubba analysis, four hub genes including VEGFA (vascular 
endothelial growth factor), ALB (Albumin), ENO2 (enolase 2), and CAVI1 (Caveolin 
1) were selected as the hub genes. Further, it was validated through extensive 
analysis of TCGA datasets that these VEGA, ENO2, and CAV1 hub genes were 
significantly up-regulated, while ALB was significantly down-regulated in KIRC 
samples compared to controls. The dysregulation of these genes was found to be 
associated with the overall survival (OS) of the KIRC patients. Moreover, this 
study also revealed some novel links between VEGA, ALB, ENO2, and CAV1 
expression and genetic alterations, promoter methylation status, immune cell 
infiltration, miRNAs, gene enrichment terms, and various chemotherapeutic drugs. 
The present study revealed a panel of four hub genes, which contributed to 
improving our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of KIRC 
development and can be utilized as promising novel biomarkers for KIRC 
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

Renal cell carcinoma can arise from lesions in the renal epithelium. This 
particular type of cancer is prevalent in the realm of renal cancers and is 
associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Among these cases, over 70% are 
classified as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Since the underlying 
causes of KIRC haven't been fully understood, there is an urgent need for deeper 
investigation into its pathogenesis. Various tools, software, and molecular 
analysis was used, including Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting 
Genes/Proteins (STRING), Cytoscape, University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer 
data analysis Portal (UALCAN), muTarget, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive 
Analysis (GEPIA), OncoDB, Human Protein Atlas (HPA), cBioPortal, Kaplan-Meier 
(KM) plotter, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Tumor IMmune Estimation 
Resource (TIMER), Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes (ENCORI), DrugBank, 
Encyclopedia of RNA Interactomes (RT-qPCR), targeted bisulfide sequencing 
(bisulfide-seq), and receiver operating curve (ROC) to matrix metallopeptidase 
(MMP) gene family constituents, with the precise objective of identifying a 
small set of hub genes. These hub genes hold the potential to be harnessed as 
molecular biomarkers for KIRC. By performing STRING and CytoHubba analyses of 
the 24 MMP gene family members, MMP2 (matrix metallopeptidase 2), MMP9 (matrix 
metallopeptidase 9), MMP14 (matrix metallopeptidase 14), and MMP16 (matrix 
metallopeptidase 16) were recognized as hub genes having highest degree scores. 
After conducting an in-depth expression analysis of MMP2, MMP9, MMP14, and MMP16 
using various The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases and RT-qPCR techniques, 
these displayed a significant increase in expression at both the mRNA and 
protein levels within KIRC samples when compared to control samples. The impact 
of the over expression of MMP2, MMP9, MMP14, and MMP16 also left a distinct mark 
on the worst overall survival (OS) rates of KIRC patients. Furthermore, a 
targeted bisulfide-seq investigation unveiled a correlation between promoter 
hypomethylation patterns and the up-regulation of these key genes in KIRC 
patients. Additionally, hub genes were involved in various diverse oncogenic 
pathways. In conclusion, four MMP gene family members, including MMP2, MMP9, 
MMP14, and MMP16 may serve as therapeutic target and molecular biomarker in 
KIRC.

The low survival rate of Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) patients is 
largely attributed to cisplatin resistance. Rather than focusing solely on 
individual proteins, exploring protein-protein interactions could offer greater 
insight into drug resistance. To this end, a series of in silico and in vitro 
experiments were conducted to identify hub genes in the intricate network of 
cisplatin resistance-related genes in KIRC chemotherapy. The genes involved in 
cisplatin resistance across KIRC were retrieved from the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database using search terms as "Kidney renal 
clear cell carcinoma" and "Cisplatin resistance". The genes retrieved were 
analyzed for hub gene identification using the STRING database and Cytoscape 
tool. Expression and promoter methylation profiling of the hub genes was done 
using UALCAN, GEPIA, OncoDB, and HPA databases. Mutational, survival, functional 
enrichment, immune cell infiltration, and drug prediction analyses of the hub 
genes were performed using the cBioPortal, GEPIA, GSEA, TIMER, and DrugBank 
databases. Lastly, expression and methylation levels of the hub genes were 
validated on two cisplatin-resistant RCC cell lines (786-O and A-498) and a 
normal renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) using two high throughput 
techniques, including targeted bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite-seq) and RT-qPCR. 
A total of 124 genes were identified as being associated with cisplatin 
resistance in KIRC. Out of these genes, MCL1, IGF1R, CCND1, and PTEN were 
identified as hub genes and were found to have significant (p < 0.05) variations 
in their mRNA and protein expressions and effects on the overall survival (OS) 
of the KIRC patients. Moreover, an aberrant promoter methylation pattern was 
found to be associated with the dysregulation of the hub genes. In addition to 
this, hub genes were also linked with different cisplatin resistance-causing 
pathways. Thus, hub genes can be targeted with Alvocidib, Estradiol, Tretinoin, 
Capsaicin, Dronabinol, Metribolone, Calcitriol, Acetaminophen, Acitretin, 
Cyclosporine, Azacitidine, Genistein, and Resveratrol drugs. As the pathogenesis 
of KIRC is complex, targeting hub genes and associated pathways involved in 
cisplatin resistance could bring a milestone change in the drug discovery and 
management of drug resistance, which might uplift overall survival among KIRC 
patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the 
accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques followed by intracellular neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. An unrestrained immune 
response by microglia, the resident cells of the central nervous system (CNS), 
leads to neuroinflammation which can amplify AD pathology. AD pathology is also 
driven by metabolic dysfunction with strong correlations between dementia and 
metabolic disorders such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and 
hypertriglyceridemia. Since elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels appear 
to be a major risk factor for developing AD, we investigated the lipid 
metabolism transcriptome in an AD versus non-AD state using RNA-sequencing 
(RNA-seq) and microarray datasets from N9 cells and murine microglia. We 
identified 52 differentially expressed genes (DEG) linked to lipid metabolism in 
LPS-stimulated N9 microglia versus unstimulated control cells using RNA-seq, 86 
lipid metabolism DEG in 5XFAD versus wild-type mice by microarray, with 16 DEG 
common between both datasets. Functional enrichment and network analyses 
identified several biological processes and molecular functions, such as 
cholesterol homeostasis, insulin signaling, and triglyceride metabolism. 
Furthermore, therapeutic drugs targeting lipid metabolism DEG found in our study 
were identified. Focusing on drugs that target genes associated with lipid 
metabolism and neuroinflammation could provide new targets for AD drug 
development.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated various sectors, including the 
pharmaceutical industry and research, where it has been utilized to efficiently 
identify new chemical entities with desirable properties. The application of AI 
algorithms to drug discovery presents both remarkable opportunities and 
challenges. This review article focuses on the transformative role of AI in 
medicinal chemistry. We delve into the applications of machine learning and deep 
learning techniques in drug screening and design, discussing their potential to 
expedite the early drug discovery process. In particular, we provide a 
comprehensive overview of the use of AI algorithms in predicting protein 
structures, drug-target interactions, and molecular properties such as drug 
toxicity. While AI has accelerated the drug discovery process, data quality 
issues and technological constraints remain challenges. Nonetheless, new 
relationships and methods have been unveiled, demonstrating AI's expanding 
potential in predicting and understanding drug interactions and properties. For 
its full potential to be realized, interdisciplinary collaboration is essential. 
This review underscores AI's growing influence on the future trajectory of 
medicinal chemistry and stresses the importance of ongoing synergies between 
computational and domain experts.

MOTIVATION: Cancer heterogeneity drastically affects cancer therapeutic 
outcomes. Predicting drug response in vitro is expected to help formulate 
personalized therapy regimens. In recent years, several computational models 
based on machine learning and deep learning have been proposed to predict drug 
response in vitro. However, most of these methods capture drug features based on 
a single drug description (e.g. drug structure), without considering the 
relationships between drugs and biological entities (e.g. target, diseases, and 
side effects). Moreover, most of these methods collect features separately for 
drugs and cell lines but fail to consider the pairwise interactions between 
drugs and cell lines.
RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework, named MSDRP for 
drug response prediction. MSDRP uses an interaction module to capture 
interactions between drugs and cell lines, and integrates multiple 
associations/interactions between drugs and biological entities through 
similarity network fusion algorithms, outperforming some state-of-the-art models 
in all performance measures for all experiments. The experimental results of de 
novo test and independent test demonstrate the excellent performance of our 
model for new drugs. Furthermore, several case studies illustrate the 
rationality for using feature vectors derived from drug similarity matrices from 
multisource data to represent drugs and the interpretability of our model.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an important cause of cancer-associated 
deaths worldwide. Therefore, the exact molecular mechanisms of NSCLC are 
unidentified. The present investigation aims to identify the miRNAs with 
predictive value in NSCLC. The two datasets were downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNA) and 
mRNAs (DEmRNA) were selected from the normalized data. Next, miRNA-mRNA 
interactions were determined. Then, co-expression network analysis was completed 
using the WGCNA package in R software. The co-expression network between 
DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs was calculated to prioritize the miRNAs. Next, the 
enrichment analysis was performed for DEmiRNA and DEmRNA. Finally, the drug-gene 
interaction network was constructed by importing the gene list to dgidb 
database. A total of 3,033 differentially expressed genes and 58 DE miRNA were 
recognized from two datasets. The co-expression network analysis was utilized to 
build a gene co-expression network. Next, four modules were selected based on 
the Zsummary score. In the next step, a bipartite miRNA-gene network was 
constructed and hub miRNAs (let-7a-2-3p, let-7d-5p, let-7b-5p, let-7a-5p, and 
let-7b-3p) were selected. Finally, a drug-gene network was constructed while 
SUNITINIB, MEDROXYPROGESTERONE ACETATE, DOFETILIDE, HALOPERIDOL, and CALCITRIOL 
drugs were recognized as a beneficial drug in NSCLC. The hub miRNAs and 
repurposed drugs may act a vital role in NSCLC progression and treatment, 
respectively; however, these results must validate in further clinical and 
experimental assessments.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the COVID-19 
health emergency, affecting and killing millions of people worldwide. Following 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 patients show a spectrum of symptoms ranging from 
asymptomatic to very severe manifestations. In particular, bronchial and 
pulmonary cells, involved at the initial stage, trigger a hyper-inflammation 
phase, damaging a wide range of organs, including the heart, brain, liver, 
intestine and kidney. Due to the urgent need for solutions to limit the virus' 
spread, most efforts were initially devoted to mapping outbreak trajectories and 
variant emergence, as well as to the rapid search for effective therapeutic 
strategies. Samples collected from hospitalized or dead COVID-19 patients from 
the early stages of pandemic have been analyzed over time, and to date they 
still represent an invaluable source of information to shed light on the 
molecular mechanisms underlying the organ/tissue damage, the knowledge of which 
could offer new opportunities for diagnostics and therapeutic designs. For these 
purposes, in combination with clinical data, omics profiles and network models 
play a key role providing a holistic view of the pathways, processes and 
functions most affected by viral infection. In fact, in addition to 
epidemiological purposes, networks are being increasingly adopted for the 
integration of multiomics data, and recently their use has expanded to the 
identification of drug targets or the repositioning of existing drugs. These 
topics will be covered here by exploring the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 
survey-based studies using systems biology approaches derived from omics data, 
paying particular attention to those that have considered samples of human 
origin.

There is an ongoing need for patient-specific chemotherapy for pancreatic 
cancer. Tumour cells isolated from human tissues can be used to predict 
patients' response to chemotherapy. However, the isolation and maintenance of 
pancreatic cancer cells is challenging because these cells become highly 
vulnerable after losing the tumour microenvironment. Therefore, we investigated 
whether the cells retained their original characteristics after lentiviral 
transfection and expansion. Three human primary pancreatic cancer cell lines 
were lentivirally transduced to create expandable (Ex) cells which were then 
compared with primary (Pri) cells. No obvious differences in the morphology or 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were observed between the primary and 
expandable cell lines. The two expandable cell lines showed higher proliferation 
rates in the 2D and 3D models. All three expandable cell lines showed attenuated 
migratory ability. Differences in gene expression between primary and expandable 
cell lines were then compared using RNA-Seq data. Potential target drugs were 
predicted by differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and differentially expressed 
pathways (DEPs) related to tumour-specific characteristics such as 
proliferation, migration, EMT, drug resistance, and reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) were investigated using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
database. We found that the two expandable cell lines expressed similar 
chemosensitivity and redox-regulatory capability to gemcitabine and oxaliplatin 
in the 2D model as compared to their counterparts. In conclusion, we 
successfully generated expandable primary pancreatic cancer cell lines using 
lentiviral transduction. These expandable cells not only retain some 
tumour-specific biological traits of primary cells but also show an ongoing 
proliferative capacity, thereby yielding sufficient material for drug response 
assays, which may provide a patient-specific platform for chemotherapy drug 
screening.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic lipid-driven inflammatory response of the innate 
and adaptive immune systems, and it is responsible for several cardiovascular 
ischemic events. The present study aimed to determine immune 
infiltration-related biomarkers in carotid atherosclerotic plaques (CAPs). Gene 
expression profiles of CAPs were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the CAPs and control 
groups were screened by the "limma" package in R software. Immune cell 
infiltration between the CAPs and control groups was evaluated by the single 
sample gene set enrichment analysis. Key infiltrating immune cells in the CAPs 
group were screened by the Wilcoxon test and least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator regression. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
was used to identify immune cell-related genes. Hub genes were identified by the 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Receiver operating characteristic 
curve analysis was performed to assess the gene's ability to differentiate 
between the CAPs and control groups. Finally, we constructed a 
miRNA-gene-transcription factor network of hub genes by using the ENCODE 
database. Eleven different types of immune infiltration-related cells were 
identified between the CAPs and control groups. A total of 1,586 differentially 
expressed immunity-related genes were obtained through intersection between DEGs 
and immune-related genes. Twenty hub genes were screened through the PPI 
network. Eventually, 7 genes (BTK, LYN, PTPN11, CD163, CD4, ITGAL, and ITGB7) 
were identified as the hub genes of CAPs, and these genes may serve as the 
estimable drug targets for patients with CAPs.

To identify addiction genes, we evaluate intravenous self-administration of 
cocaine or saline in 84 inbred and recombinant inbred mouse strains over 
10 days. We integrate the behavior data with brain RNA-seq data from 41 strains. 
The self-administration of cocaine and that of saline are genetically distinct. 
We maximize power to map loci for cocaine intake by using a linear mixed model 
to account for this longitudinal phenotype while correcting for population 
structure. A total of 15 unique significant loci are identified in the 
genome-wide association study. A transcriptome-wide association study highlights 
the Trpv2 ion channel as a key locus for cocaine self-administration as well as 
identifying 17 additional genes, including Arhgef26, Slc18b1, and Slco5a1. We 
find numerous instances where alternate splice site selection or RNA editing 
altered transcript abundance. Our work emphasizes the importance of Trpv2, an 
ionotropic cannabinoid receptor, for the response to cocaine.

INTRODUCTION: Asthma is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease often associated 
with other complex phenotypes. Identifying asthma-associated diseases and 
uncovering the molecular mechanisms mediating their interaction can help 
detangle the heterogeneity of asthma. Network analysis is a powerful approach 
for untangling such inter-disease relationships.
METHODS: Here, we integrated information on physical contacts between common 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene expression with expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from the lung and whole blood to construct 
two tissue-specific spatial gene regulatory networks (GRN). We then located the 
asthma GRN (level 0) within each tissue-specific GRN by identifying the genes 
that are functionally affected by asthma-associated spatial eQTLs. Curated 
protein interaction partners were subsequently identified up to four edges or 
levels away from the asthma GRN. The eQTLs spatially regulating genes on levels 
0-4 were queried against the GWAS Catalog to identify the traits enriched 
(hypergeometric test; FDR ≤ 0.05) in each level.
RESULTS: We identified 80 and 82 traits significantly enriched in the lung and 
blood GRNs, respectively. All identified traits were previously reported to be 
comorbid or associated (positively or negatively) with asthma (e.g., depressive 
symptoms and lung cancer), except 8 traits whose association with asthma is yet 
to be confirmed (e.g., reticulocyte count). Our analysis additionally pinpoints 
the variants and genes that link asthma to the identified asthma-associated 
traits, a subset of which was replicated in a comorbidity analysis using health 
records of 26,781 asthma patients in New Zealand.
DISCUSSION: Our discovery approach identifies enriched traits in the regulatory 
space proximal to asthma, in the tissue of interest, without a priori selection 
of the interacting traits. The predictions it makes expand our understanding of 
possible shared molecular interactions and therapeutic targets for asthma, where 
no cure is currently available.

The spatial organization of the tumor microenvironment has a profound impact on 
biology and therapy response. Here, we perform an integrative single-cell and 
spatial transcriptomic analysis on HPV-negative oral squamous cell carcinoma 
(OSCC) to comprehensively characterize malignant cells in tumor core (TC) and 
leading edge (LE) transcriptional architectures. We show that the TC and LE are 
characterized by unique transcriptional profiles, neighboring cellular 
compositions, and ligand-receptor interactions. We demonstrate that the gene 
expression profile associated with the LE is conserved across different cancers 
while the TC is tissue specific, highlighting common mechanisms underlying tumor 
progression and invasion. Additionally, we find our LE gene signature is 
associated with worse clinical outcomes while TC gene signature is associated 
with improved prognosis across multiple cancer types. Finally, using an in 
silico modeling approach, we describe spatially-regulated patterns of cell 
development in OSCC that are predictably associated with drug response. Our work 
provides pan-cancer insights into TC and LE biology and interactive spatial 
atlases ( http://www.pboselab.ca/spatial_OSCC/ ; 
http://www.pboselab.ca/dynamo_OSCC/ ) that can be foundational for developing 
novel targeted therapies.

Molecular profiling reports (MPRs) are critical for determining treatment 
options for cancer patients. They include several pages of information on 
genomic findings, drugs, and trial options that are challenging to synthesize 
for effectively and expeditiously informing on treatment. Xu and Kowalski 
present a web application, myCMIE, that synthesizes MPR content to define a 
patient-centric, information system in which molecular profiles are exchanged 
between a query case(s) and public resources or user-input case series for 
context-informed treatment and conjecture with therapeutic implication. myCMIE 
offers an interactive build of coordinately connected digital-twin communities 
to expand our understanding of treatment context with multiple visuals to 
stimulate discussions among diverse stakeholders in care.

GBM is the most common and aggressive type of brain tumor. It is classified as a 
grade IV tumor by the WHO, the highest grade. Prognosis is generally poor, with 
most patients surviving only about a year. Only 5% of patients survive longer 
than 5 years. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive GBM progression 
is critical for developing better diagnostic and treatment strategies. 
Identifying key genes involved in GBM pathogenesis is essential to fully 
understand the disease and develop targeted therapies. In this study two 
datasets, GSE108474 and GSE50161, were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) to compare gene expression between GBM and normal samples. Differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and analyzed. To construct a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the commonly up-regulated and 
down-regulated genes, the STRING 11.5 and Cytoscape 3.9.1 were utilized. Key 
genes were identified through this network analysis. The GEPIA database was used 
to confirm the expression levels of these key genes and their association with 
survival. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses on the DEGs were conducted 
using the Enrichr server. In total, 698 DEGs were identified, consisting of 377 
up-regulated genes and 318 down-regulated genes. Within the PPI network, 11 key 
up-regulated genes and 13 key down-regulated genes associated with GBM were 
identified. NOTCH1, TOP2A, CD44, PTPRC, CDK4, HNRNPU, and PDGFRA were found to 
be important targets for potential drug design against GBM. Additionally, 
functional enrichment analysis revealed the significant impact of Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV), Cell Cycle, and P53 signaling pathways on GBM.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) not only maintains the health of Asian people 
but also provides a great resource of active natural products for modern drug 
development. Herein, we developed a Database of Constituents Absorbed into the 
Blood and Metabolites of TCM (DCABM-TCM), the first database systematically 
collecting blood constituents of TCM prescriptions and herbs, including 
prototypes and metabolites experimentally detected in the blood, together with 
the corresponding detailed detection conditions through manual literature 
mining. The DCABM-TCM has collected 1816 blood constituents with chemical 
structures of 192 prescriptions and 194 herbs and integrated their related 
annotations, including physicochemical, absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
excretion, and toxicity properties, and associated targets, pathways, and 
diseases. Furthermore, the DCABM-TCM supported two blood constituent-based 
analysis functions, the network pharmacology analysis for TCM molecular 
mechanism elucidation, and the target/pathway/disease-based screening of 
candidate blood constituents, herbs, or prescriptions for TCM-based drug 
discovery. The DCABM-TCM is freely accessible at 
http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/dcabm-tcm/. The DCABM-TCM will contribute to the 
elucidation of effective constituents and molecular mechanism of TCMs and the 
discovery of TCM-derived drug-like compounds that are both bioactive and 
bioavailable.

Lysosome dysfunction has been shown to play an important role in cancer 
progression. However, few research studies have reported the role of lysosomes 
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) progression. Lysosome-related 
genes (LRGs) were collected from the Molecular Signatures Database. 
Differentially expressed lysosome-related genes (DELRGs) were identified from 
the TCGA-HNSCC dataset. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and 
multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to identify the prognostic genes. 
The prognostic values and expression of hub DELRGs were further validated by GEO 
datasets. Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumors using 
Expression data and the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis were applied 
to evaluate the correlation between cathepsin G (CTSG) and immune infiltrates. 
Twenty-two DELRGs were identified. Among them, CTSG was an independent 
prognostic biomarker for HNSCC patients. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated 
that the potential mechanism of CTSG in regulating HNSCC was associated with the 
immune- and inflammation-related pathways. CTSG expression was highly correlated 
with immune cell infiltration. Finally, two potential compounds (CH and MAN) 
targeting CTSG protein were identified, and their reliability was validated 
through molecular docking analysis. CTSG was associated with immune infiltration 
and had prognostic value in HNSCC patients, which may be a potential biomarker 
for predicting the outcome of immunotherapy.

Post stroke depression (PSD) is a common neuropsychiatric complication following 
stroke closely associated with the immune system. The development of medications 
for PSD remains to be a considerable challenge due to the unclear mechanism of 
PSD. Multiple researches agree that the functions of gene ontology (GO) are 
efficient for the investigation of disease mechanisms, and DeepPurpose (DP) is 
extremely valuable for the mining of new drugs. However, GO terms and DP have 
not yet been applied to explore the pathogenesis and drug treatment of PSD. This 
study aimed to interpret the mechanism of PSD and discover important drug 
candidates targeting risk proteins, based on immune-related risk GO functions 
and informatics algorithms. According to the risk genes of PSD, we identified 
335 immune-related risk GO functions and 37 compounds. Based on the construction 
of the GO function network, we found that STAT protein may be a pivot protein in 
underlying the mechanism of PSD. Additionally, we also established networks of 
Protein-Protein Interaction as well as Gene-GO function to facilitate the 
evaluation of key genes. Based on DP, a total of 37 candidate compounds 
targeting 7 key proteins were identified with a potential for the therapy of 
PSD. Furthermore, we noted that the mechanisms by which luteolin and triptolide 
acting on STAT-related GO function might involve three crucial pathways, 
including specifically hsa04010 (MAPK signaling pathway), hsa04151 (PI3K-Akt 
signaling pathway) and hsa04060 (Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction). Thus, 
this study provided fresh and powerful information for the mechanism and 
therapeutic strategies of PSD.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify significant mechanisms and potential 
treatments for temporomandibular joint internal derangement (TMJD) through 
integrated bioinformatics analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression data sets (GSE66864) from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were downloaded. Differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were identified both in the treatment groups and in controls by R 
packages. Network analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) and Human 
Protein Atlas was used to explore DEGs' potential function. DGIdb database was 
utilized to gain potential drug targets.
RESULTS: In conclusion, 126 DEGs were selected for TMJD through bioinformatics 
analysis. Both GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses combined 
showed the pathways involved in TMJD. A PPI network was constructed to select 
the top 10 hub genes, of which five hub genes were chosen for further 
investigation. Moreover, the microenvironment of immune cells related to hub 
genes was evaluated by R packages. Macrophages play an important role in 
inflammation and oral-related tumors. The Human Protein Atlas analysis indicated 
that the five hub genes are highly related to head and neck cancer. Finally, 
eight potential drugs were selected for two genes using the DGIdb database.
CONCLUSION: Our integrated bioinformatics analysis identified DEGs in TMJD and 
provided potential ideas for further research and treatment approaches. However, 
experimental validation of the hub genes and potential drug targets is still 
needed. The key mechanisms of the identified genes and their potential roles as 
biomarkers or drug targets in TMJD require further investigation.

The concept of aging is complex, including many related phenotypes such as 
healthspan, lifespan, extreme longevity, frailty and epigenetic aging, 
suggesting shared biological underpinnings; however, aging-related endpoints 
have been primarily assessed individually. Using data from these traits and 
multivariate genome-wide association study methods, we modeled their underlying 
genetic factor ('mvAge'). mvAge (effective n = ~1.9 million participants of 
European ancestry) identified 52 independent variants in 38 genomic loci. Twenty 
variants were novel (not reported in input genome-wide association studies). 
Transcriptomic imputation identified age-relevant genes, including VEGFA and 
PHB1. Drug-target Mendelian randomization with metformin target genes showed a 
beneficial impact on mvAge (P value = 8.41 × 10-5). Similarly, genetically 
proxied thiazolidinediones (P value = 3.50 × 10-10), proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibition (P value = 1.62 × 10-6), angiopoietin-like protein 
4, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also had beneficial Mendelian 
randomization estimates. Extending the drug-target Mendelian randomization 
framework to 3,947 protein-coding genes prioritized 122 targets. Together, these 
findings will inform future studies aimed at improving healthy aging.

Anxiety disorders are a group of prevalent and heritable neuropsychiatric 
diseases. We previously conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) which 
identified genomic loci associated with anxiety; however, the biological 
consequences underlying the genetic associations are largely unknown. 
Integrating GWAS and functional genomic data may improve our understanding of 
the genetic effects on intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene 
expression. This can provide an opportunity for the discovery of drug targets 
for anxiety via drug repurposing. We used the GWAS summary statistics to 
determine putative causal genes for anxiety using MAGMA and colocalization 
analyses. A transcriptome-wide association study was conducted to identify genes 
with differential genetically regulated levels of gene expression in human brain 
tissue. The genes were integrated with a large drug-gene expression database 
(Connectivity Map), discovering compounds that are predicted to "normalise" 
anxiety-associated expression changes. The study identified 64 putative causal 
genes associated with anxiety (35 genes upregulated; 29 genes downregulated). 
Drug mechanisms adrenergic receptor agonists, sigma receptor agonists, and 
glutamate receptor agonists gene targets were enriched in anxiety-associated 
genetic signal and exhibited an opposing effect on the anxiety-associated gene 
expression signature. The significance of the project demonstrated genetic links 
for novel drug candidates to potentially advance anxiety therapeutics.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. 
Donafenib is a multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the 
treatment of patients with advanced HCC, but its clinical effect is very 
limited. Here, through integrated screening of a small-molecule inhibitor 
library and a druggable CRISPR library, that GSK-J4 is synthetically lethal with 
donafenib in liver cancer is shown. This synergistic lethality is validated in 
multiple HCC models, including xenograft, orthotopically induced HCC, 
patient-derived xenograft, and organoid models. Furthermore, co-treatment with 
donafenib and GSK-J4 resulted in cell death mainly via ferroptosis. 
Mechanistically, through integrated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and assay for 
transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) 
analyses, that donafenib and GSK-J4 synergistically promoted the expression of 
HMOX1 and increased the intracellular Fe2+ level is found, eventually leading to 
ferroptosis. Additionally, through cleavage under targets & tagmentation 
followed by sequencing (CUT&Tag-seq), it is found that the enhancer regions 
upstream of HMOX1 promoter significantly increased under donafenib and GSK-J4 
co-treatment. A chromosome conformation capture assay confirmed that the 
increased expression of HMOX1 is caused by the significantly enhanced 
interaction between the promoter and upstream enhancer under dual-drug 
combination. Taken together, this study elucidates a new synergistic lethal 
interaction in liver cancer.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) constitute a powerful tool to identify 
the different biochemical pathways associated with disease. This knowledge can 
be used to prioritize drugs targeting these routes, paving the road to clinical 
application. Here, we describe DAGGER (Drug Repositioning by Analysis of GWAS 
and Gene Expression in R), a straightforward pipeline to find currently approved 
drugs with repurposing potential. As a proof of concept, we analyzed a meta-GWAS 
of 1.6 × 107 single-nucleotide polymorphisms performed on Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Our pipeline uses the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and Drug Gene 
Interaction (DGI) databases for a rational prioritization of 22 druggable 
targets. Next, we performed a two-stage in vivo functional assay. We used a C. 
elegans humanized model over-expressing the Aβ1-42 peptide. We assayed the five 
top-scoring candidate drugs, finding midostaurin, a multitarget protein kinase 
inhibitor, to be a protective drug. Next, 3xTg AD transgenic mice were used for 
a final evaluation of midostaurin's effect. Behavioral testing after three weeks 
of 20 mg/kg intraperitoneal treatment revealed a significant improvement in 
behavior, including locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, and new-place 
recognition. Altogether, we consider that our pipeline might be a useful tool 
for drug repurposing in complex diseases.

BACKGROUND: Preinjury of peripheral nerves triggers dorsal root ganglia (DRG) 
axon regeneration, a biological change that is more pronounced in young mice 
than in old mice, but the complex mechanism has not been clearly explained. 
Here, we aim to gain insight into the mechanisms of axon regeneration after 
conditioning lesion in different age groups of mice, thereby providing effective 
therapeutic targets for central nervous system (CNS) injury.
METHODS: The microarray GSE58982 and GSE96051 were downloaded and analyzed to 
identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network, the miRNA-TF-target gene network, and the drug-hub gene network 
of conditioning lesion were constructed. The L4 and L5 DRGs, which were 
previously axotomized by the sciatic nerve conditioning lesions, were harvested 
for qRT-PCR. Furthermore, histological and behavioral tests were performed to 
assess the therapeutic effects of the candidate drug telmisartan in spinal cord 
injury (SCI).
RESULTS: A total of 693 and 885 DEGs were screened in the old and young mice, 
respectively. Functional enrichment indicates that shared DEGs are involved in 
the inflammatory response, innate immune response, and ion transport. QRT-PCR 
results showed that in DRGs with preinjury of peripheral nerve, Timp1, P2ry6, 
Nckap1l, Csf1, Ccl9, Anxa1, and C3 were upregulated, while Agtr1a was 
downregulated. Based on the bioinformatics analysis of DRG after conditioning 
lesion, Agtr1a was selected as a potential therapeutic target for the SCI 
treatment. In vivo experiments showed that telmisartan promoted axonal 
regeneration after SCI by downregulating AGTR1 expression.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive map of transcriptional changes 
that discriminate between young and old DRGs in response to injury. The hub 
genes and their related drugs that may affect the axonal regeneration program 
after conditioning lesion were identified. These findings revealed the 
speculative pathogenic mechanism involved in conditioning-dependent regenerative 
growth and may have translational significance for the development of CNS injury 
treatment in the future.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. 
While recent research suggests epigenetic disturbances in OUD, this is mostly 
limited to DNA methylation (5mC). DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) has been widely 
understudied. We conducted a multi-omics profiling of OUD in a male cohort, 
integrating neuronal-specific 5mC and 5hmC as well as gene expression profiles 
from human postmortem orbitofrontal cortex (OUD = 12; non-OUD = 26). Single 
locus methylomic analysis and co-methylation analysis showed a higher number of 
OUD-associated genes and gene networks for 5hmC compared to 5mC; these were 
enriched for GPCR, Wnt, neurogenesis, and opioid signaling. 5hmC marks also 
showed a higher correlation with gene expression patterns and enriched for GWAS 
of psychiatric traits. Drug interaction analysis revealed interactions with 
opioid-related drugs, some used as OUD treatments. Our multi-omics findings 
suggest an important role of 5hmC and reveal loci epigenetically dysregulated in 
OFC neurons of individuals with OUD.

Ferroptosis is a recently identified form of cell death that is distinct from 
the conventional modes such as necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy. Its role in 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains inadequately understood. To address 
this gap, we obtained BPD-related RNA-seq data and ferroptosis-related genes 
(FRGs) from the GEO database and FerrDb, respectively. A total of 171 
BPD-related differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DE-FRGs) linked 
to the regulation of autophagy and immune response were identified. Least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator and SVM-RFE algorithms identified 23 
and 14 genes, respectively, as marker genes. The intersection of these 2 sets 
yielded 9 genes (ALOX12B, NR1D1, LGMN, IFNA21, MEG3, AKR1C1, CA9, ABCC5, and 
GALNT14) with acceptable diagnostic capacity. The results of the functional 
enrichment analysis indicated that these identified marker genes may be involved 
in the pathogenesis of BPD through the regulation of immune response, cell 
cycle, and BPD-related pathways. Additionally, we identified 29 drugs that 
target 5 of the marker genes, which could have potential therapeutic 
implications. The ceRNA network we constructed revealed a complex regulatory 
network based on the marker genes, further highlighting their potential roles in 
BPD. Our findings offer diagnostic potential and insight into the mechanism 
underlying BPD. Further research is needed to assess its clinical utility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by cutaneous 
eruptions and pruritus. Because the genetic backgrounds of psoriasis are only 
partially revealed, an integrative and rigorous study is necessary. We conducted 
a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) with the new Genotype-Tissue 
Expression version 8 reference panels, including some tissue and multi-tissue 
panels that were not used previously. We performed tissue-specific heritability 
analyses on genome-wide association study data to prioritize the tissue panels 
for TWAS analysis. TWAS and colocalization (COLOC) analyses were performed with 
eight tissues from the single-tissue panels and the multi-tissue panels of 
context-specific genetics (CONTENT) to increase tissue specificity and 
statistical power. From TWAS, we identified the significant associations of 101 
genes in the single-tissue panels and 64 genes in the multi-tissue panels, of 
which 26 genes were replicated in the COLOC. Functional annotation and network 
analyses identified that the genes were associated with psoriasis and/or immune 
responses. We also suggested drug candidates that interact with jointly 
significant genes through a conditional and joint analysis. Together, our 
findings may contribute to revealing the underlying genetic mechanisms and 
provide new insights into treatments for psoriasis.

OBJECTIVE: Pyroptosis, a lytic and inflammatory programmed cell death, has been 
implicated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. 
Nonetheless, it remains elusive exactly which pyroptosis molecule exerts an 
essential role in T2DM, and this study aims to solve such issue.
METHODS: Transcriptional profiling datasets of T2DM, i.e., GSE20966, GSE95849, 
and GSE26168, were acquired. Four machine learning models, namely, random 
forest, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, and generalized 
linear modeling, were built based on pyroptosis genes. A nomogram of key 
pyroptosis genes was also generated, and the clinical value was appraised via 
calibration curves and decision curve analysis. Immune infiltration was inferred 
utilizing CIBERSORT. Drug-druggable target relationships were acquired from the 
Drug Gene Interaction Database. Through WGCNA, key pyroptosis-relevant genes 
were selected.
RESULTS: Most pyroptosis genes exhibited upregulation in T2DM relative to 
controls, indicating the activity of pyroptosis in T2DM. The SVM model composed 
of BAK1, CHMP2B, NLRP6, PLCG1, and TIRAP exhibited the best performance in T2DM 
diagnosis, with AUC = 1. The nomogram can predict the risk of T2DM for clinical 
practice. NK cells resting exhibited a lower abundance in T2DM versus normal 
specimens, with a higher abundance of neutrophils. NLRP6 was positively linked 
with neutrophils. Drugs (keracyanin, 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, diclofenac, 
phosphomethylphosphonic acid adenosyl ester, acetaminophen, cefixime, aspirin, 
ustekinumab) potentially targeted the key pyroptosis genes. Additionally, 
CHMP2B-relevant genes were determined.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, this work proposes the key pyroptosis genes in T2DM, 
which might become possible molecules for the management and treatment of T2DM 
and its complications.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most prevalent malignant 
gastrointestinal tumor. Ion channels contribute to tumor growth and progression 
through interactions with their neighboring molecules including lipids. The 
dysregulation of membrane ion channels and lipid metabolism may contribute to 
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to metastatic progression. 
Herein, transcriptome profiles of patients with ESCC were analyzed by performing 
differential gene expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis to 
identify the altered ion channels, lipid metabolism- and EMT-related genes in 
ESCC. A total of 1,081 differentially expressed genes, including 113 ion 
channels, 487 lipid metabolism-related, and 537 EMT-related genes, were 
identified in patients with ESCC. Thereafter, EMT scores were correlated with 
altered co-expressed genes. The altered co-expressed genes indicated a 
correlation with EMT signatures. Interactions among 22 ion channels with 3 hub 
lipid metabolism- and 13 hub EMT-related proteins were determined using 
protein-protein interaction networks. A pathway map was generated to depict 
deregulated signaling pathways including insulin resistance and the estrogen 
receptor-Ca2+ signaling pathway in ESCC. The relationship between potential ion 
channels and 5-year survival rates in ESCC was determined using Kaplan-Meier 
plots and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Inositol 
1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3) was found to be associated with poor 
prognosis of patients with ESCC. Additionally, drugs interacting with potential 
ion channels, including GJA1 and ITPR3, were identified. Understanding 
alterations in ion channels with lipid metabolism and EMT in ESCC 
pathophysiology would most likely provide potential targets for the better 
treatment of patients with ESCC.

OBJECTIVES: The regulation of various cellular functions such as growth, 
proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis, is dependent on the PI3K pathway. 
Recent evidence has indicated that kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) can 
be triggered by the deregulation of this pathway. The objective of this research 
was to investigate 25 genes associated with activation of the PI3K pathway in 
KIRC and control samples to identify four hub genes that might serve as novel 
molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for treating KIRC.
METHODS: Multi-omics in silico and in vitro analysis was employed to find hub 
genes related to the PI3K pathway that may be biomarkers and therapeutic targets 
for KIRC.
RESULTS: Using STRING software, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of 
25 PI3K pathway-related genes was developed. Based on the degree scoring method, 
the top four hub genes were identified using Cytoscape's Cytohubba plug-in. TCGA 
datasets, KIRC (786-O and A-498), and normal (HK2) cells were used to validate 
the expression of hub genes. Additionally, further bioinformatic analyses were 
performed to investigate the mechanisms by which hub genes are involved in the 
development of KIRC. Out of a total of 25 PI3K pathway-related genes, we 
developed and validated a diagnostic and prognostic model based on the 
up-regulation of TP53 (tumor protein 53) and CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and the 
down-regulation of PTEN (Phosphatase and TENsin homolog deleted on chromosome 
10), and GSK3B (Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta) hub genes. The hub genes 
included in our model may be a novel therapeutic target for KIRC treatment. 
Additionally, associations between hub genes and infiltration of immune cells 
can enhance comprehension of immunotherapy for KIRC.
CONCLUSION: We have created a new diagnostic and prognostic model for KIRC 
patients that uses PI3K pathway-related hub genes (TP53, PTEN, CCND1, and 
GSK3B). Nevertheless, further experimental studies are required to ascertain the 
efficacy of our model.

BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are highly 
prevalent and seriously affect the patient's quality of life. Patients with OSA 
have a high incidence of OA, however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. 
Here, we investigated the molecular link between OSA and OA via bioinformatics 
analysis and experimental validation.
METHODS: We downloaded a peripheral blood monocyte microarray profile (GSE75097) 
for patients with OSA and two synovial microarray profiles (GSE55235 and 
GSE55457) for patients with OA from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We 
identified OSA-associated differentially expressed genes (OSA-DEGs) in patients 
with OA. Additionally, we constructed protein-protein interaction networks to 
identify the key genes involved in OA. Immunohistochemistry was performed to 
verify the expression of key genes in OA rat models. RNA interference assay was 
performed to validate the effects of key genes on synovial cells. Gene-miRNA, 
gene-transcription factor, and gene-drug networks were constructed to predict 
the regulatory molecules and drugs for OA.
RESULTS: Fifteen OSA-DEGs screened using the threshold criteria were enriched in 
the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway. Combining the 12 algorithms of 
CytoHubba, we identified JUNB, JUN, dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), and 
TNF-alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) as the key OSA-DEGs involved in OA 
development. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
revealed that these key genes were downregulated in the OA synovium, promoting 
TNF-α expression. Therefore, OSA-DEGs, JUN, JUNB, DUSP1, and TNFAIP3 function in 
OA by increasing TNF-α expression. Our findings provide insights on the 
mechanisms underlying the effects of OSA on OA.

BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), a prevalent malignant 
tumor with a low survival rate, is often accompanied by ferroptosis, which is a 
recently-described type ofprogrammed cell death. Investigating the significance 
of ferroptosis driver genes in HNSC, this study aimed to assess their diagnostic 
and prognostic values, as well as their impact on treatment and tumor immune 
function. The results of this investigation provide novel insight into using 
ferroptosis-related genes as molecular biomarkers as well as precise 
chemotherapeutic targets for the therapy of HNSC.
METHODOLOGY: A detailed in silico and in vitro experiment-based methodology was 
adopted to achieve the goals.
RESULTS: A total of 233 ferroptosis driver genes were downloaded from the FerrDB 
database. After comprehensively analyzing these 233 ferroptosis driver genes by 
various TCGA databases, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), and Reverse Transcription 
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) techniques, TP53 
(tumor protein 53), PTEN (Phosphatase and TENsin homolog deleted on chromosome 
10), KRAS (Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog), and HRAS (Harvey 
Rat sarcoma virus) were identified as differentially expressed hub genes. 
Interestingly, these hub genes were found to have significant (P < 0.05) 
variations in their mRNA and protein expressions and effects on overall survival 
of the HNSC patients. Moreover, targeted bisulfite-sequencing (bisulfite-seq) 
analysis revealed that promoter hypomethylation pattern was associated with 
up-regulation of hub genes (TP53, PTEN, KRAS, and HRAS). In addition to this, 
hub genes were involved in diverse oncogenic pathways.
CONCLUSION: Since HNSC pathogenesis is a complex process, using ferroptosis 
driver hub genes (TP53, PTEN, KRAS, and HRAS) as a diagnostic and prognostic 
tool, and therapeutically targeting those genes through appropriate drugs could 
bring a milestone change in the drug discovery and management and survival in 
HNSC.

Protein structural domains have been less studied than full-length proteins in 
terms of ontology annotations. The dcGO database has filled this gap by 
providing mappings from protein domains to ontologies. The dcGO update in 2023 
extends annotations for protein domains of multiple definitions (SCOP, Pfam, and 
InterPro) with commonly used ontologies that are categorised into functions, 
phenotypes, diseases, drugs, pathways, regulators, and hallmarks. This update 
adds new dimensions to the utility of both ontology and protein domain 
resources. A newly designed website at http://www.protdomainonto.pro/dcGO offers 
a more centralised and user-friendly way to access the dcGO database, with 
enhanced faceted search returning term- and domain-specific information pages. 
Users can navigate both ontology terms and annotated domains through improved 
ontology hierarchy browsing. A newly added facility enables domain-based 
ontology enrichment analysis.

Background: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is the leading cause of lower 
back pain, and an overall understanding of the molecular mechanisms related to 
IDD is still lacking. The purpose of this study was to explore gene signatures 
and immune cell infiltration related to IDD via bioinformatics analysis. 
Methods: A total of five expression profiles of mRNA and non-coding RNA were 
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The potentially 
involved lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks and protein-protein interaction 
networks were constructed by miRNet, circBank, STRING, and the Cytoscape 
database. Gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes Analysis, Gene 
Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Set Variation Analysis, Immune Infiltration 
Analysis, and Drug-Gene Interaction were used to analyse the top 20 hub genes. 
RT-qPCR was conducted to confirm the 12 differential expressions of genes both 
in the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus tissues Results: There were 346 
differentially expressed mRNAs, 12 differentially expressed miRNAs, 883 
differentially expressed lncRNAs, and 916 differentially expressed circRNAs in 
the GEO database. Functional and enrichment analyses revealed hub genes 
associated with platelet activation, immune responses, focal adhesion, and 
PI3K-Akt signalling. The apoptotic pathway, the reactive oxygen species pathway, 
and oxidative phosphorylation play an essential role in IDD. Immune infiltration 
analysis demonstrated that the Treg cells had significant infiltration, and 
three levels of immune cells, including dendritic cells, Th2 cells, and 
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, were inhibited in IDD. Drug-gene interaction 
analysis showed that COL1A1 and COL1A2 were targeted by collagenase clostridium 
histolyticum, ocriplasmin, and PDGFRA was targeted by 66 drugs or molecular 
compounds. Finally, 24 cases of IDD tissues and 12 cases of normal disc tissues 
were collected, and the results of RT-qPCR were consistent with the 
bioinformatics results. Conclusion: Our data indicated that the 20 hub genes and 
immune cell infiltration were involved in the pathological process of IDD. In 
addition, the PDGFRA and two potential drugs were found to be significant in IDD 
development.

Treatments for neurodegenerative disorders remain rare, although recent FDA 
approvals, such as Lecanemab and Aducanumab for Alzheimer's Disease, highlight 
the importance of the underlying biological mechanisms in driving discovery and 
creating disease modifying therapies. The global population is aging, driving an 
urgent need for therapeutics that stop disease progression and eliminate 
symptoms. In this study, we create an open framework and resource for 
evidence-based identification of therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative 
disease. We use Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization to identify genetic 
targets for drug discovery and repurposing. In parallel, we provide mechanistic 
insights into disease processes and potential network-level consequences of 
gene-based therapeutics. We identify 116 Alzheimer's disease, 3 amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, 5 Lewy body dementia, 46 Parkinson's disease, and 9 
Progressive supranuclear palsy target genes passing multiple test corrections 
(pSMR_multi < 2.95×10-6 and pHEIDI > 0.01). We created a therapeutic scheme to 
classify our identified target genes into strata based on druggability and 
approved therapeutics - classifying 41 novel targets, 3 known targets, and 115 
difficult targets (of these 69.8% are expressed in the disease relevant cell 
type from single nucleus experiments). Our novel class of genes provides a 
springboard for new opportunities in drug discovery, development and repurposing 
in the pre-competitive space. In addition, looking at drug-gene interaction 
networks, we identify previous trials that may require further follow-up such as 
Riluzole in AD. We also provide a user-friendly web platform to help users 
explore potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases, decreasing 
activation energy for the community

INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune disease 
characterized by synovial inflammation and bone destruction, with a largely 
unclear etiology. Evidence has indicated that ferroptosis may play an 
increasingly important role in the onset and development of RA. However, 
ferroptosis-related genes are still largely unexplored in RA. Therefore, this 
work focused on identifying and validating the potential ferroptosis-related 
genes involved in RA through bioinformatics analysis.
METHODS: We screened differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFGs) 
between RA patients and healthy individuals based on GSE55235 dataset. 
Subsequently, correlation analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
analysis, GO, and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using these DEFGs. 
Finally, our results were validated by GSE12021 dataset.
RESULTS: We discovered 34 potential DEFGs in RA based on bioinformatics 
analysis. According to functional enrichment analysis, these genes were mainly 
enriched in HIF-1 signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and Ferroptosis 
pathway. Four genes (GABARPL1, DUSP1, JUN, and MAPK8) were validated to be 
downregulated by GSE12021 dataset and were diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic 
targets for RA via the regulation of ferroptosis.
DISCUSSION: Our results help shed more light on the pathogenesis of RA. 
Ferroptosis-related genes in RA are valuable diagnostic biomarkers and they will 
be exploited clinically as therapeutic targets in the future.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) are believed to share 
clinical symptoms, genetic risk, etiological factors, and pathogenic mechanisms. 
We previously reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms spanning chromosome 
3p21.1 showed significant associations with both schizophrenia and BD, and a 
risk SNP rs2251219 was in linkage disequilibrium with a human specific Alu 
polymorphism rs71052682, which showed enhancer effects on transcriptional 
activities using luciferase reporter assays in U251 and U87MG cells.
METHODS: CRISPR/Cas9-directed genome editing, real-time quantitative PCR, and 
public Hi-C data were utilized to investigate the correlation between the Alu 
polymorphism rs71052682 and NISCH. Primary neuronal culture, immunofluorescence 
staining, co-immunoprecipitation, lentiviral vector production, intracranial 
stereotaxic injection, behavioral assessment, and drug treatment were used to 
examine the physiological impacts of Nischarin (encoded by NISCH).
RESULTS: Deleting the Alu sequence in U251 and U87MG cells reduced mRNA 
expression of NISCH, the gene locates 180 kb from rs71052682, and Hi-C data in 
brain tissues confirmed the extensive chromatin contacts. These data suggested 
that the genetic risk of schizophrenia and BD predicted elevated NISCH 
expression, which was also consistent with the observed higher NISCH mRNA levels 
in the brain tissues from psychiatric patients compared with controls. We then 
found that overexpression of NISCH resulted in a significantly decreased density 
of mushroom dendritic spines with a simultaneously increased density of thin 
dendritic spines in primary cultured neurons. Intriguingly, elevated expression 
of this gene in mice also led to impaired spatial working memory in the Y-maze. 
Given that Nischarin is the target of anti-hypertensive agents clonidine and 
tizanidine, which have shown therapeutic effects in patients with schizophrenia 
and patients with BD in preliminary clinical trials, we demonstrated that 
treatment with those antihypertensive drugs could reduce NISCH mRNA expression 
and rescue the impaired working memory in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: We identify a psychiatric risk gene NISCH at 3p21.1 GWAS locus 
influencing dendritic spine morphogenesis and cognitive function, and Nischarin 
may have potentials for future therapeutic development.

Drugs targeting genes linked to disease via evidence from human genetics have 
increased odds of approval. Approaches to prioritize such genes include 
genome-wide association studies (GWASs), rare variant burden tests in exome 
sequencing studies (Exome), or integration of a GWAS with expression/protein 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL/pQTL-GWAS). Here, we compare gene-prioritization 
approaches on 30 clinically relevant traits and benchmark their ability to 
recover drug targets. Across traits, prioritized genes were enriched for drug 
targets with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.17, 2.04, 1.81, and 1.31 for the GWAS, 
eQTL-GWAS, Exome, and pQTL-GWAS methods, respectively. Adjusting for differences 
in testable genes and sample sizes, GWAS outperforms e/pQTL-GWAS, but not the 
Exome approach. Furthermore, performance increased through gene network 
diffusion, although the node degree, being the best predictor (OR = 8.7), 
revealed strong bias in literature-curated networks. In conclusion, we 
systematically assessed strategies to prioritize drug target genes, highlighting 
the promises and pitfalls of current approaches.

PURPOSE: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease involving multiple 
mechanisms, of which ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death. Recent 
studies have shown that ferroptosis may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis 
of asthma, but no specific ferroptosis gene has been found in asthma, and the 
exact mechanism is still unclear. The present study aimed to screen ferroptosis 
genes associated with asthma and find therapeutic targets, in order to 
contribute a new clue for the diagnosis and therapy of asthma.
METHODS: Ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (FR-DEGs) in asthma 
were selected by the GSE41861, GSE43696 and ferroptosis datasets. Next, the 
FR-DEGs were subjected by GO and KEGG enrichment, and the mRNA-miRNA network was 
constructed. Then, GSEA and GSVA enrichment analysis and Immune infiltration 
analysis were performed, followed by targeted drug prediction. Finally, the 
expression of FR-DEGs was confirmed using GSE63142 dataset and RT-PCR assay.
RESULTS: We found 13 FR-DEGs by the GSE41861, GSE43696 and ferroptosis database. 
Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the 13 FR-DEGs were enriched in 
oxidative stress, immune response, ferroptosis, lysosome, necrosis, apoptosis 
etc. Moreover, our results revealed the mRNA-miRNA network of the FR-DEGs and 
identified candidate drugs. Also, immune infiltration revealed that ELAVL1, 
CREB5, CBR1 and NR1D2 are associated with the immune cells and may be potential 
targets in asthma. Finally, 10 FR-DEGs were validated by the GSE63142 database. 
It was verified that 7 FR-DEGs were differentially expressed by collecting 
asthma patients and healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: This study ultimately identified 7 FR-DEGs for the diagnosis and 
therapy of asthma. These 7 FR-DEGs contribute to oxidative stress and immune 
responses. This study provides potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for 
asthma patients, shedding further light on the pathogenesis of asthma as well as 
providing new insights into the treatment of asthma.

The expression of the placental growth factor (PGF) in cancer cells and the 
tumor microenvironment can contribute to the induction of angiogenesis, 
supporting cancer cell metabolism by ensuring an adequate blood supply. 
Angiogenesis is a key component of cancer metabolism as it facilitates the 
delivery of nutrients and oxygen to rapidly growing tumor cells. PGF is 
recognized as a novel target for anti-cancer treatment due to its ability to 
overcome resistance to existing angiogenesis inhibitors and its impact on the 
tumor microenvironment. We aimed to integrate bioinformatics evidence using 
various data sources and analytic tools for target-indication identification of 
the PGF target and prioritize the indication across various cancer types as an 
initial step of drug development. The data analysis included PGF gene function, 
molecular pathway, protein interaction, gene expression and mutation across 
cancer type, survival prognosis and tumor immune infiltration association with 
PGF. The overall evaluation was conducted given the totality of evidence, to 
target the PGF gene to treat the cancer where the PGF level was highly expressed 
in a certain tumor type with poor survival prognosis as well as possibly 
associated with poor tumor infiltration level. PGF showed a significant impact 
on overall survival in several cancers through univariate or multivariate 
survival analysis. The cancers considered as target diseases for PGF inhibitors, 
due to their potential effects on PGF, are adrenocortical carcinoma, kidney 
cancers, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and uveal 
melanoma.

BACKGROUND: In many applications of bioinformatics, data stem from distinct 
heterogeneous sources. One of the well-known examples is the identification of 
drug-target interactions (DTIs), which is of significant importance in drug 
discovery. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, manifold optimization 
based kernel preserving embedding (MOKPE), to efficiently solve the problem of 
modeling heterogeneous data. Our model projects heterogeneous drug and target 
data into a unified embedding space by preserving drug-target interactions and 
drug-drug, target-target similarities simultaneously.
RESULTS: We performed ten replications of ten-fold cross validation on four 
different drug-target interaction network data sets for predicting DTIs for 
previously unseen drugs. The classification evaluation metrics showed better or 
comparable performance compared to previous similarity-based state-of-the-art 
methods. We also evaluated MOKPE on predicting unknown DTIs of a given network. 
Our implementation of the proposed algorithm in R together with the scripts that 
replicate the reported experiments is publicly available at

How to effectively convert genomic summary data into downstream knowledge 
discovery represents a major challenge in human genomics research. To address 
this challenge, we have developed efficient and effective approaches and tools. 
Extending our previously established software tools, we here introduce OpenXGR 
(http://www.openxgr.com), a newly designed web server that offers almost 
real-time enrichment and subnetwork analyses for a user-input list of genes, 
SNPs or genomic regions. It achieves so through leveraging ontologies, networks, 
and functional genomic datasets (such as promoter capture Hi-C, e/pQTL and 
enhancer-gene maps for linking SNPs or genomic regions to candidate genes). Six 
analysers are provided, each doing specific interpretations tailored to genomic 
summary data at various levels. Three enrichment analysers are designed to 
identify ontology terms enriched for input genes, as well as genes linked from 
input SNPs or genomic regions. Three subnetwork analysers allow users to 
identify gene subnetworks from input gene-, SNP- or genomic region-level summary 
data. With a step-by-step user manual, OpenXGR provides a user-friendly and 
all-in-one platform for interpreting summary data on the human genome, enabling 
more integrated and effective knowledge discovery.

Background: Patients with anaphylaxis are at risk for ST-segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the pathological links between 
anaphylaxis and STEMI remain unclear. Here, we aimed to explore shared 
biological processes, immune effector cells, and hub genes of anaphylaxis and 
STEMI. Methods: Gene expression data for anaphylactic (GSE69063) and STEMI 
(GSE60993) patients with corresponding healthy controls were pooled from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differential expression analysis, enrichment 
analysis, and CIBERSORT were used to reveal transcriptomic signatures and immune 
infiltration profiles of anaphylaxis and STEMI, respectively. Based on common 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology analysis, cytoHubba 
algorithms, and correlation analyses were performed to identify biological 
processes, hub genes, and hub gene-related immune cells shared by anaphylaxis 
and STEMI. The robustness of hub genes was assessed in external anaphylactic 
(GSE47655) and STEMI (GSE61144) datasets. Furthermore, a murine model of 
anaphylaxis complicated STEMI was established to verify hub gene expressions. 
The logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency 
of hub genes. Results: 265 anaphylaxis-related DEGs were identified, which were 
associated with immune-inflammatory responses. 237 STEMI-related DEGs were 
screened, which were involved in innate immune response and myeloid leukocyte 
activation. M0 macrophages and dendritic cells were markedly higher in both 
anaphylactic and STEMI samples compared with healthy controls, while CD4+ naïve 
T cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower. Enrichment analysis of 33 
common DEGs illustrated shared biological processes of anaphylaxis and STEMI, 
including cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, response to reactive oxygen 
species, and positive regulation of defense response. Six hub genes were 
identified, and their expression levels were positively correlated with M0 
macrophage abundance and negatively correlated with CD4+ naïve T cell abundance. 
In external anaphylactic and STEMI samples, five hub genes (IL1R2, FOS, MMP9, 
DUSP1, CLEC4D) were confirmed to be markedly upregulated. Moreover, 
experimentally induced anaphylactic mice developed impaired heart function 
featuring STEMI and significantly increased expression of the five hub genes. 
DUSP1 and CLEC4D were screened as blood diagnostic biomarkers of anaphylaxis and 
STEMI based on the logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Anaphylaxis and 
STEMI share the biological processes of inflammation and defense responses. 
Macrophages, dendritic cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ naïve T cells constitute an 
immune cell population that acts in both anaphylaxis and STEMI. Hub genes (DUSP1 
and CLEC4D) identified here provide candidate genes for diagnosis, prognosis, 
and therapeutic targeting of STEMI in anaphylactic patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is raging worldwide and causes an immense 
disease burden. Despite this, the biomarkers and targeting drugs of COVID-19 of 
differing severity remain largely unknown. Based on the GSE164805 dataset, we 
identified modules most critical for mild COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) and severe 
COVID-19 (sCOVID-19) through WGCNA, respectively. We subsequently constructed a 
protein-protein interaction network, and detected 16 hub genes for mCOVID-19 and 
10 hub genes for sCOVID-19, followed by the prediction of upstream transcription 
factors (TFs) and kinases. The enrichment analysis then showed downregulation of 
TNFA signaling via NFKB for mCOVID-19, as well as downregulation of MYC targets 
V1 for sCOVID-19. Infiltration degrees of many immune cells, such as 
macrophages, were also sharply different between mCOVID-19 and sCOVID-19 
samples. Predicted protein targeting drugs with the highest scores nearly all 
belong to naturally derived or synthetic glucocorticoids. For the two 
single-cell RNA-seq datasets, we explored the expression distribution of hub 
genes for mCOVID-19/sCOVID-19 in each cell type. The expression levels of PRKCA, 
MCM5, TYMS, RBBP4, BCL6, FLOT1, KDM6B, and TLR2 were found to be 
cell-type-specific. Furthermore, the expression levels of 10 hub genes for 
mCOVID-19 were significantly upregulated in PBMCs between eight healthy controls 
and eight mCOVID-19 patients at our institution. Collectively, we detected 
critical modules, pathways, TFs, kinases, immune cells, targeting drugs, hub 
genes, and their expression distributions in different cell types that may 
involve the pathogenesis of COVID-19 of differing severity, which may propel 
earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of this intractable disease in 
the future.

MOTIVATION: Screening new drug-target interactions (DTIs) by traditional 
experimental methods is costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in knowledge 
graphs, chemical linear notations, and genomic data enable researchers to 
develop computational-based-DTI models, which play a pivotal role in drug 
repurposing and discovery. However, there still needs to develop a multimodal 
fusion DTI model that integrates available heterogeneous data into a unified 
framework.
RESULTS: We developed MDTips, a multimodal-data-based DTI prediction system, by 
fusing the knowledge graphs, gene expression profiles, and structural 
information of drugs/targets. MDTips yielded accurate and robust performance on 
DTI predictions. We found that multimodal fusion learning can fully consider the 
importance of each modality and incorporate information from multiple aspects, 
thus improving model performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate 
that deep learning-based encoders (i.e. Attentive FP and Transformer) outperform 
traditional chemical descriptors/fingerprints, and MDTips outperforms other 
state-of-the-art prediction models. MDTips is designed to predict the input 
drugs' candidate targets, side effects, and indications with all available 
modalities. Via MDTips, we reverse-screened candidate targets of 6766 drugs, 
which can be used for drug repurposing and discovery.

This paper applies different link prediction methods on a knowledge graph 
generated from biomedical literature, with the aim to compare their ability to 
identify unknown drug-gene interactions and explain their predictions. 
Identifying novel drug-target interactions is a crucial step in drug discovery 
and repurposing. One approach to this problem is to predict missing links 
between drug and gene nodes, in a graph that contains relevant biomedical 
knowledge. Such a knowledge graph can be extracted from biomedical literature, 
using text mining tools. In this work, we compare state-of-the-art graph 
embedding approaches and contextual path analysis on the interaction prediction 
task. The comparison reveals a trade-off between predictive accuracy and 
explainability of predictions. Focusing on explainability, we train a decision 
tree on model predictions and show how it can aid the understanding of the 
prediction process. We further test the methods on a drug repurposing task and 
validate the predicted interactions against external databases, with very 
encouraging results.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a malignancy 
characterized by challenging early diagnosis and poor prognosis. It is believed 
that coagulation has an impact on the tumor microenvironment of PDAC. The aim of 
this study is to further distinguish coagulation-related genes and investigate 
immune infiltration in PDAC.
METHODS: We gathered two subtypes of coagulation-related genes from the KEGG 
database, and acquired transcriptome sequencing data and clinical information on 
PDAC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Using an unsupervised 
clustering method, we categorized patients into distinct clusters. We 
investigated the mutation frequency to explore genomic features and performed 
enrichment analysis, utilizing Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes (KEGG) to explore pathways. CIBERSORT was used to analyze the relationship 
between tumor immune infiltration and the two clusters. A prognostic model was 
created for risk stratification, and a nomogram was established to assist in 
determining the risk score. The response to immunotherapy was assessed using the 
IMvigor210 cohort. Finally, PDAC patients were recruited, and experimental 
samples were collected to validate the infiltration of neutrophils using 
immunohistochemistry. In addition, and identify the ITGA2 expression and 
function were identified by analyzing single cell sequencing data.
RESULTS: Two coagulation-related clusters were established based on the 
coagulation pathways present in PDAC patients. Functional enrichment analysis 
revealed different pathways in the two clusters. Approximately 49.4% of PDAC 
patients experienced DNA mutation in coagulation-related genes. Patients in the 
two clusters displayed significant differences in terms of immune cell 
infiltration, immune checkpoint, tumor microenvironment and TMB. We developed a 
4-gene prognostic stratified model through LASSO analysis. Based on the risk 
score, the nomogram can accurately predict the prognosis in PDAC patients. We 
identified ITGA2 as a hub gene, which linked to poor overall survival (OS) and 
short disease-free survival (DFS). Single-cell sequencing analysis demonstrated 
that ITGA2 was expressed by ductal cells in PDAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the correlation between coagulation-related 
genes and the tumor immune microenvironment. The stratified model can predict 
the prognosis and calculate the benefits of drug therapy, thus providing the 
recommendations for clinical personalized treatment.

Moving a new drug from bench to bedside is a long and arduous process. The 
tactic of drug repurposing, which solves "new" diseases with "old" existing 
drugs, is more efficient and economical than conventional ab-initio way for drug 
development. Information technology has dramatically changed the paradigm of 
biomedical research in the new century, and drug repurposing studies have been 
significantly accelerated by implementing informatics techniques related to 
genomics, systems biology and biophysics during the past few years. A series of 
remarkable achievements in this field comes with the practical applications of 
in silico approaches including transcriptomic signature matching, 
gene-connection-based scanning, and simulated structure docking in repositioning 
drug therapies against breast cancer. In this review, we systematically curated 
these impressive accomplishments with summarization of the main findings on 
potentially repurposable drugs, and provide our insights into the current issues 
as well as future directions of the field. With the prospective improvement in 
reliability, the computer-assisted repurposing strategy will play a more 
critical role in drug research and development.

Colorectal cancers are derived from intestinal polyps. Normally, alterations in 
cell adhesion genes expression cause deviation from the normal cell cycle, 
leading to cancer development, progression, and invasion. The present study 
aimed to investigate the elusive expression pattern of CDC42, TAGLN, and GSN 
genes in patients with high and low-risk polyp samples, and also colorectal 
cancer patients and their adjacent normal tissues. In upcoming study, 40 biopsy 
samples from Taleghani Hospital (Tehran, Iran) were collected, consisting of 20 
colon polyps and 20 paired adjacent normal tissues. The expression of the 
nominated genes CDC42, TAGLN, and GSN was analyzed using quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (Q-PCR) and relative quantification was determined using the 
2-ΔΔCt method. ROC curve analysis was performed to compare high-risk and 
low-risk polyps for the investigated genes. The expression of adhesion molecule 
genes was also evaluated using TCGA data and the correlation between adhesion 
molecule gene expression and immunophenotype was analyzed. The role of mi-RNAs 
and lncRNAs in overexpression of adhesion molecule genes was studied. Lastly, GO 
and KEGG were performed to identify pathways related to adhesion molecule genes 
expression in healthy, normal adjacent, and COAD tissues. The results showed 
that the expression patterns of these genes were significantly elevated in 
high-risk adenomas compared to low-risk polyps and normal tissues and were 
associated with various clinicopathological characteristics. The estimated AUC 
for CDC42, TAGLN, and GSN were 0.87, 0.77, and 0.80, respectively. The study 
also analyzed COAD cancer patient data and found that the selected gene 
expression in cancer patients was significantly reduced compared to high-risk 
polyps and healthy tissues. Survival analysis showed that while the expression 
level of the GSN gene had no significant relationship with survival rate, the 
expression of CDC42 and TAGLN genes did have a meaningful relationship, but with 
opposite effects, suggesting the potential use of these genes as diagnostic or 
prognostic markers for colorectal cancer. The present study's findings suggest 
that the expression pattern of CDC42, TAGLN, and GSN genes was significantly 
increased during the transformation of normal tissue to polyp lesions, 
indicating their potential as prognostic biomarkers for colorectal polyp 
development. Further results provide valuable insights into the potential use of 
these genes as diagnostic or prognostic markers for colorectal cancer. However, 
further studies are necessary to validate these findings in larger cohorts and 
to explore the underlying mechanisms of these genes in the development and 
progression of colorectal cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Evidences show that there may be a link between SLE and COVID-19. The 
purpose of this study is to screen out the diagnostic biomarkers of systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) with COVID-19 and explore the possible related 
mechanisms by the bioinformatics approach.
METHODS: SLE and COVID-19 datasets were extracted separately from the NCBI Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The limma package in R was used to obtain the 
differential genes (DEGs). The protein interaction network information (PPI) and 
core functional modules were constructed in the STRING database using Cytoscape 
software. The hub genes were identified by the Cytohubba plugin, and TF-gene 
together with TF-miRNA regulatory networks were constructed via utilizing the 
Networkanalyst platform. Subsequently, we generated subject operating 
characteristic curves (ROC) to verify the diagnostic capabilities of these hub 
genes to predict the risk of SLE with COVID-19 infection. Finally, a 
single-sample gene set enrichment (ssGSEA) algorithm was used to analyze immune 
cell infiltration.
RESULTS: A total of 6 common hub genes (CDC6, PLCG1, KIF15, LCK, CDC25C, and 
RASGRP1) were identified with high diagnostic validity. These gene functional 
enrichments were mainly involved in cell cycle, and inflammation-related 
pathways. Compared to the healthy controls, abnormal infiltration of immune 
cells was found in SLE and COVID-19, and the proportion of immune cells linked 
to the 6 hub genes.
CONCLUSION: Our research logically identified 6 candidate hub genes that could 
predict SLE complicated with COVID-19. This work provides a foothold for further 
study of potential pathogenesis in SLE and COVID-19.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common complication of diabetes and can lead 
to severe disability and even amputation. Despite advances in treatment, there 
is currently no cure for DFUs and available drugs for treatment are limited. 
This study aimed to identify new candidate drugs and repurpose existing drugs to 
treat DFUs based on transcriptomics analysis. A total of 31 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and used to prioritize the biological 
risk genes for DFUs. Further investigation using the database DGIdb revealed 12 
druggable target genes among 50 biological DFU risk genes, corresponding to 31 
drugs. Interestingly, we highlighted that two drugs (urokinase and lidocaine) 
are under clinical investigation for DFU and 29 drugs are potential candidates 
to be repurposed for DFU therapy. The top 5 potential biomarkers for DFU from 
our findings are IL6ST, CXCL9, IL1R1, CXCR2, and IL10. This study highlights 
IL1R1 as a highly promising biomarker for DFU due to its high systemic score in 
functional annotations, that can be targeted with an existing drug, Anakinra. 
Our study proposed that the integration of transcriptomic and 
bioinformatic-based approaches has the potential to drive drug repurposing for 
DFUs. Further research will further examine the mechanisms by which targeting 
IL1R1 can be used to treat DFU.

An open challenge in human genetics is to better understand the systems-level 
impact of genotype variation on developmental cognition. To characterize the 
genetic underpinnings of peri-adolescent cognition, we performed 
genotype-phenotype and systems analysis for binarized accuracy in nine cognitive 
tasks from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (~2,200 individuals of 
European continental ancestry aged 8-21 years). We report a region of 
genome-wide significance within the 3' end of the Fibulin-1 gene 
(P = 4.6 × 10-8), associated with accuracy in nonverbal reasoning, a heritable 
form of complex reasoning ability. Diffusion tensor imaging data from a subset 
of these participants identified a significant association of white matter 
fractional anisotropy with FBLN1 genotypes (P < 0.025); poor performers show an 
increase in the C and A allele for rs77601382 and rs5765534, respectively, which 
is associated with increased fractional anisotropy. Integration of published 
human brain-specific 'omic maps, including single-cell transcriptomes of the 
developing human brain, shows that FBLN1 demonstrates greatest expression in the 
fetal brain, as a marker of intermediate progenitor cells, demonstrates 
negligible expression in the adolescent and adult human brain, and demonstrates 
increased expression in the brain in schizophrenia. Collectively these findings 
warrant further study of this gene and genetic locus in cognition, 
neurodevelopment, and disease. Separately, genotype-pathway analysis identified 
an enrichment of variants associated with working memory accuracy in pathways 
related to development and to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Top-ranking 
pathway genes include those genetically associated with diseases with working 
memory deficits, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. This work 
advances the "molecules-to-behavior" view of cognition and provides a framework 
for using systems-level organization of data for other biomedical domains.

BACKGROUND: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is closely related to a wide range of 
cellular functions and is a key component to maintain and restore metabolic 
health. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a serious threat to human health, but 
the ER stress (ERS)-related mechanisms in T2DM have not been fully elucidated.
AIM: To identify potential ERS-related mechanisms and crucial biomarkers in 
T2DM.
METHODS: We conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation 
analysis (GSVA) in myoblast and myotube form GSE166502, and obtained the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After intersecting with ERS-related 
genes, we obtained ERS-related DEGs. Finally, functional analyses, immune 
infiltration, and several networks were established.
RESULTS: Through GSEA and GSVA, we identified several metabolic and 
immune-related pathways. We obtained 227 ERS-related DEGs and constructed 
several important networks that help to understand the mechanisms and treatment 
of T2DM. Finally, memory CD4+ T cells accounted for the largest proportion of 
immune cells.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed ERS-related mechanisms in T2DM, which might 
contribute to new ideas and insights into the mechanisms and treatment of T2DM.

Background: Ovarian Serous Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originating from 
epithelial cells and one of the most common causes of death from gynecological 
cancers. The objective of this study was to develop a prediction model based on 
extracellular matrix proteins, using artificial intelligence techniques. The 
model aimed to aid healthcare professionals to predict the overall survival of 
patients with ovarian cancer (OC) and determine the efficacy of immunotherapy. 
Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas Ovarian Cancer (TCGA-OV) data collection was 
used as the study dataset, whereas the TCGA-Pancancer dataset was used for 
validation. The prognostic importance of 1068 known extracellular matrix 
proteins for OC were determined by the Random Forest algorithm and the Lasso 
algorithm establishing the ECM risk score. Based on the gene expression data, 
the differences in mRNA abundance, tumour mutation burden (TMB) and tumour 
microenvironment (TME) between the high- and low-risk groups were assessed. 
Results: Combining multiple artificial intelligence algorithms we were able to 
identify 15 key extracellular matrix genes, namely, AMBN, CXCL11, PI3, CSPG5, 
TGFBI, TLL1, HMCN2, ESM1, IL12A, MMP17, CLEC5A, FREM2, ANGPTL4, PRSS1, FGF23, 
and confirm the validity of this ECM risk score for overall survival prediction. 
Several other parameters were identified as independent prognostic factors for 
OC by multivariate COX analysis. The analysis showed that thyroglobulin (TG) 
targeted immunotherapy was more effective in the high ECM risk score group, 
while the low ECM risk score group was more sensitive to the RYR2 gene-related 
immunotherapy. Additionally, the patients with low ECM risk scores had higher 
immune checkpoint gene expression and immunophenoscore levels and responded 
better to immunotherapy. Conclusion: The ECM risk score is an accurate tool to 
assess the patient's sensitivity to immunotherapy and forecast OC prognosis.

Background: Bone giant cell tumor (BGCT) is one of the world's major disease 
types of locally aggressive bone tumors. In recent years, denosumab treatment 
has been introduced before curettage surgery. However, the current therapeutic 
was practical only sometimes, given the local recurrence effects after 
discontinuation of denosumab. Due to the complex nature of BGCT, this study aims 
to use bioinformatics to identify potential genes and drugs associated with 
BGCT. Methods: The genes that integrate BGCT and fracture healing were 
determined by text mining. The gene was obtained from the pubmed2ensembl 
website. We filtered out common genes for the function, and signal pathway 
enrichment analyses were implemented. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
networks and the hub genes were screened by MCODE built-in Cytoscape software. 
Lastly, the confirmed genes were queried in the Drug Gene Interaction Database 
to determine potential genes and drugs. Results: Our study finally identified 
123 common specific genes in bone giant cell tumors and fracture healing text 
mining concepts. The GO enrichment analysis finally analyzed 115 characteristic 
genes in BP, CC, and MF. We selected 10 KEGG pathways and identified 68 
characteristic genes. We performed protein-protein interaction analysis (PPI) on 
68 selected genes and finally identified seven central genes. In this study, 
these seven genes were substituted into drug-gene interactions, and there were 
15 antineoplastic drugs, 1 anti-involving drug, and 1 anti-influenza drug. 
Conclusion: The 7 genes (including ANGPT2, COL1A1, COL1A2, CTSK, FGFR1, NTRK2, 
and PDGFB) and 17 drugs, which have not been used in BGCT, but 6 of them 
approved by the FDA for other diseases, could be potential genes and drugs, 
respectively, to improve BGCT treatment. In addition, the correlation study and 
analysis of potential drugs through genes provide great opportunities to promote 
the repositioning of drugs and the study of pharmacology in the pharmaceutical 
industry.

Glycoproteins are an underexploited drug target for cancer therapeutics. In this 
work, we integrated computational methods in network pharmacology and in silico 
docking approaches to identify phytochemical compounds that could potentially 
interact with several cancer-associated glycoproteins. We first created a 
database of phytochemicals from selected plant species, Manilkara zapota 
(sapodilla/chico), Mangifera indica (mango), Annona muricata (soursop/guyabano), 
Artocarpus heterophyllus (jackfruit/langka), Lansium domesticum 
(langsat/lanzones), and Antidesma bunius (bignay), and performed pharmacokinetic 
analysis to determine their drug-likeness properties. We then constructed a 
phytochemical-glycoprotein interaction network and characterized the degree of 
interactions between the phytochemical compounds and with cancer-associated 
glycoproteins and other glycosylation-related proteins. We found a high degree 
of interactions from α-pinene (Mangifera indica), cyanomaclurin (Artocarpus 
heterophyllus), genistein (Annona muricata), kaempferol (Annona muricata and 
Antidesma bunius), norartocarpetin (Artocarpus heterophyllus), quercetin (Annona 
muricata, Antidesma bunius, Manilkara zapota, Mangifera indica), rutin (Annona 
muricata, Antidesma bunius, Lansium domesticum), and ellagic acid (Antidesma 
bunius and Mangifera indica). Subsequent docking analysis confirmed that these 
compounds could potentially bind to EGFR, AKT1, KDR, MMP2, MMP9, ERBB2, IGF1R, 
MTOR, and HRAS proteins, which are known cancer biomarkers. In vitro 
cytotoxicity assays of the plant extracts showed that the n-hexane, ethyl 
acetate, and methanol leaf extracts from A. muricata, L. domesticum and M. 
indica gave the highest growth inhibitory activity against A549 lung cancer 
cells. These may help further explain the reported cytotoxic activities of 
select compounds from these plant species.

Millions of people worldwide visit, live or work in the hypoxic environment 
encountered at high altitudes and it is important to understand the biomolecular 
responses to this stress. This would help design mitigation strategies for high 
altitude illnesses. In spite of a number of studies spanning over 100 years, 
still the complex mechanisms controlling acclimatization to hypoxia remain 
largely unknown. To identify potential diagnostic, therapeutic and predictive 
markers for HA stress, it is important to comprehensively compare and analyse 
these studies. Towards this goal, HighAltitudeOmicsDB is a unique resource that 
provides a comprehensive, curated, user-friendly and detailed compilation of 
various genes/proteins which have been experimentally validated to be associated 
with various HA conditions, their protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and gene 
ontology (GO) semantic similarities. For each database entry, 
HighAltitudeOmicsDB additionally stores the level of regulation 
(up/down-regulation), fold change, study control group, duration and altitude of 
exposure, tissue of expression, source organism, level of hypoxia, method of 
experimental validation, place/country of study, ethnicity, geographical 
location etc. The database also collates information on disease and drug 
association, tissue-specific expression level, GO and KEGG pathway associations. 
The web resource is a unique server platform that offers interactive PPI 
networks and GO semantic similarity matrices among the interactors.These unique 
features help to offer mechanistic insights into the disease pathology. Hence, 
HighAltitudeOmicsDBis a unique platform for researchers working in this area to 
explore, fetch, compare and analyse HA-associated genes/proteins, their PPI 
networks, and GO semantic similarities. The database is available at 
http://www.altitudeomicsdb.in .

OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused 
by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical 
and epidemiological analysis reported the association between SARS-CoV-2 and 
neurological diseases. Among neurological diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
developed as a crucial comorbidity of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to understand 
the common transcriptional signatures between SARS-CoV-2 and AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: System biology approaches were used to compare the 
datasets of AD and COVID-19 to identify the genetic association. For this, we 
have integrated three human whole transcriptomic datasets for COVID-19 and five 
microarray datasets for AD. We have identified differentially expressed genes 
for all the datasets and constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network. Hub genes were identified from the PPI network, and hub 
genes-associated regulatory molecules (transcription factors and miRNAs) were 
identified for further validation.
RESULTS: A total of 9,500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified 
for AD and 7,000 DEGs for COVID-19. Gene ontology analysis resulted in 37 
molecular functions, 79 cellular components, and 129 biological processes were 
found to be commonly enriched in AD and COVID-19. We identified 26 hub genes 
which includes AKT1, ALB, BDNF, CD4, CDH1, DLG4, EGF, EGFR, FN1, GAPDH, INS, 
ITGB1, ACTB, SRC, TP53, CDC42, RUNX2, HSPA8, PSMD2, GFAP, VAMP2, MAPK8, CAV1, 
GNB1, RBX1, and ITGA2B. Specific miRNA targets associated with Alzheimer's 
disease and COVID-19 were identified through miRNA target prediction. In 
addition, we found hub genes-transcription factor and hub genes-drugs 
interaction. We also performed pathway analysis for the hub genes and found that 
several cell signaling pathways are enriched, such as PI3K-AKT, Neurotrophin, 
Rap1, Ras, and JAK-STAT.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the identified hub genes could be 
diagnostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic drug targets for COVID-19 
patients with AD comorbidity.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious 
respiratory disease that has posed a serious threat to people's daily lives and 
caused an unprecedented challenge to public health and people's health 
worldwide. Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a common type of lung 
malignancy with a highly aggressive nature and poor prognosis. Patients with 
LUSC could be at risk for COVID-19, We conducted this study to examine the 
potential for naringenin to develop into an ideal medicine and investigate the 
underlying action mechanisms of naringenin in COVID-19 and LUSC due to the 
anti-viral, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory activities of naringenin.
METHODS: LUSC related genes were obtained from TCGA, PharmGKB, TTD,GeneCards and 
NCBI, and then the transcriptome data for COVID-19 was downloaded from GEO, 
DisGeNET, CTD, DrugBank, PubChem, TTD, NCBI Gene, OMIM. The drug targets of 
Naringenin were revealed through CTD, BATMAN, TCMIP, SymMap, Chemical 
Association Networks, SwissTargetPrediction, PharmMapper, ECTM, and DGIdb. The 
genes related to susceptibility to COVID-19 in LUSC patients were obtained 
through differential analysis. The interaction of COVID-19/LUSC related genes 
was evaluated and demonstrated using STRING to develop a a COX risk regression 
model to screen and evaluate the association of genes with clinical 
characteristics. To investigate the related functional and pathway analysis of 
the common targets of COVID-19/LUSC and Naringenin, KEGG and GO enrichment 
analysis were employed to perform the functional analysis of the target genes. 
Finally, The Hub Gene was screened and visualized using Cytoscape, and molecular 
docking between the drug and the target was performed using Autodock.
RESULTS: We discovered numerous COVID-19/LUSC target genes and examined their 
prognostic value in LUSC patients utilizing a variety of bioinformatics and 
network pharmacology methods. Furthermore, a risk score model with strong 
predictive performance was developed based on these target genes to assess the 
prognosis of LUSC patients with COVID-19. We intersected the therapeutic target 
genes of naringenin with the LUSC, COVID-19-related targets, and identified 354 
common targets, which could be used as potential target genes for naringenin to 
treat COVID-19/LUSC. The treatment of COVID-19/LUSC with naringenin may involve 
oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antiviral, apoptosis, 
immunological, and multiple pathways containing PI3K-Akt, HIF-1, and VEGF, 
according to the results of the GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of these 354 
common targets. By constructing a PPI network, we ascertained AKT1, TP53, SRC, 
MAPK1, MAPK3, and HSP90AA1 as possible hub targets of naringenin for the 
treatment of COVID-19/LUSC. Last but not least, molecular docking investigations 
showed that naringenin has strong binding activity in COVID-19/LUSC.
CONCLUSION: We revealed for the first time the pharmacological targets and 
potential molecular processes of naringenin for the treatment of COVID-19/LUSC. 
However, these results need to be confirmed by additional research and 
validation in real LUSC patients with COVID-19.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most 
common chronic liver disease. The prognosis may vary from simple steatosis to 
more severe outcomes such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver 
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The understanding of the biological 
processes leading to NASH is limited and non-invasive diagnostic tools are 
lacking.
METHODS: The peripheral immunoproteome in biopsy-proven NAFL (n=35) and NASH 
patients (n=35) compared to matched, normal-weight healthy controls (n=15) was 
studied using a proximity extension assay, combined with spatial and single cell 
hepatic transcriptome analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 13 inflammatory serum proteins that, independent of 
comorbidities and fibrosis stage, distinguished NASH from NAFL. Analysis of 
co-expression patterns and biological networks further revealed NASH-specific 
biological perturbations indicative of temporal dysregulation of IL-4/-13, -10, 
-18, and non-canonical NF-kβ signaling. Of the identified inflammatory serum 
proteins, IL-18 and EN-RAGE as well as ST1A1 mapped to hepatic macrophages and 
periportal hepatocytes, respectively, at the single cell level. The signature of 
inflammatory serum proteins further permitted identification of biologically 
distinct subgroups of NASH patients.
CONCLUSION: NASH patients have a distinct inflammatory serum protein signature, 
which can be mapped to the liver parenchyma, disease pathogenesis, and 
identifies subgroups of NASH patients with altered liver biology.

Mapping gene networks requires large amounts of transcriptomic data to learn the 
connections between genes, which impedes discoveries in settings with limited 
data, including rare diseases and diseases affecting clinically inaccessible 
tissues. Recently, transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural 
language understanding1,2 and computer vision3 by leveraging deep learning 
models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-tuned 
towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited task-specific data. Here, 
we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, 
pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30 million single-cell 
transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited 
data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental 
understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention 
weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards 
a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics 
using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently 
boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient 
data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. 
Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which 
fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to 
accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic 
targets.

University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.

OBJECTIVE: We searched for, from the FDA (Food and Drug 
Administration-USA)-approved drugs, inhibitors of FKBP5 with tolerable adverse 
effect profiles (eg, mild headache, sedation, etc.) and with the ability to 
cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), using bio-informatics tools (in-silico). 
This may pave the road for designing clinical trials of such drugs in patients 
with functional seizures (FS) and other stress-associated disorders.
METHODS: Several databases were used to find all the approved drugs that 
potentially have interactions with FKBP51 protein [ie, CTD gene-chemical 
interaction section of FKBP51 protein of Harmonizome of Mayaanlab, DrugCenteral 
database, PDID (Protein Drug Interaction Database), DGIdb (the Drug Gene 
Interaction database)]. Other databases were also searched [eg, 
clinicaltrials.gov; DRUGBANK (the FASTA format of the FKBP51 protein was 
imported to the target sequencing section of the database to find the associated 
drugs), and the STITCH database (to find the related chemical interaction 
molecules)].
RESULTS: After a comprehensive search of the designated databases, 28 unique and 
approved drugs were identified. Fluticasone propionate and Mifepristone and 
Ponatinib, Mirtazapine, Clozapine, Enzalutamide, Sertraline, Prednisolone, 
Fluoxetine, Dexamethasone, Clomipramine, Duloxetine, Citalopram, Chlorpromazine, 
Nefazodone, and Escitalopram are inhibitors of FKBP5 and have BBB permeability.
SIGNIFICANCE: While the current in-silico repurposing study could identify 
potential drugs (that are already approved and are widely available) for 
designing clinical trials in patients with stress-associated disorders (eg, FS), 
any future clinical trial should consider the pharmacological profile of the 
desired drug and also the characteristics and comorbidities of the patients in 
order to foster a success.

Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis, that is, the leading 
cause of acquired heart disease in children, with approximately 10%-20% of 
patients with KD suffering intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance. 
Although the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear, recent 
studies have revealed that immune cell infiltration may associate with its 
occurrence. Methods: In this study, we downloaded the expression profiles from 
the GSE48498 and GSE16797 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, 
analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and intersected the DEGs with 
the immune-related genes downloaded from the ImmPort database to obtain 
differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIGs). Then CIBERSORT algorithm 
was used to calculate the immune cell compositions, followed by the WGCNA 
analysis to identify the module genes associated with immune cell infiltration. 
Next, we took the intersection of the selected module genes and DEIGs, then 
performed GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Moreover, ROC curve validation, 
Spearman analysis with immune cells, TF, and miRNA regulation network, and 
potential drug prediction were implemented for the finally obtained hub genes. 
Results: The CIBERSORT algorithm showed that neutrophil expression was 
significantly higher in IVIG-resistant patients compared to IVIG-responsive 
patients. Next, we got differentially expressed neutrophil-related genes by 
intersecting DEIGs with neutrophil-related module genes obtained by WGCNA, for 
further analysis. Enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were associated 
with immune pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and 
neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Then we combined the PPI network in the 
STRING database with the MCODE plugin in Cytoscape and identified 6 hub genes 
(TLR8, AQP9, CXCR1, FPR2, HCK, and IL1R2), which had good diagnostic performance 
in IVIG resistance according to ROC analysis. Furthermore, Spearman's 
correlation analysis confirmed that these genes were closely related to 
neutrophils. Finally, TFs, miRNAs, and potential drugs targeting the hub genes 
were predicted, and TF-, miRNA-, and drug-gene networks were constructed. 
Conclusion: This study found that the 6 hub genes (TLR8, AQP9, CXCR1, FPR2, HCK, 
and IL1R2) were significantly associated with neutrophil cell infiltration, 
which played an important role in IVIG resistance. In a word, this work rendered 
potential diagnostic biomarkers and prospective therapeutic targets for 
IVIG-resistant patients.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) is the 6th most common cancer 
around the globe; its underlying molecular mechanisms and accurate molecular 
markers are still lacking. In this study, we explored hub genes and their 
potential signaling pathways through which these genes participate in the 
development of HNSC. The GSE23036 gene microarray dataset was attained from the 
GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database. Hub genes were identified via the 
Cytohubba plug-in application of the Cytoscape. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
datasets and cell lines (HOK and FuDu) were used to evaluate expression 
variations in the hub genes. Moreover, promoter methylation, genetic alteration, 
gene enrichment, miRNA network, and immunocyte infiltration analysis were also 
performed to confirm the oncogenic role and biomarker potential of the hub genes 
in HNSC patients. Based on the hub gene analysis results, four hub genes, 
including KNTC1 (Kinetochore Associated 1), CEP55 (Centrosomal protein of 55 
kDa), AURKA (Aurora A Kinase), and ECT2 (Epithelial Cell Transforming 2), with 
the highest degree scores were denoted as hub genes. All these four genes were 
significantly up-regulated in HNSC clinical samples and cell lines relative to 
their counterparts. Overexpression of KNTC1, CEP55, AURKA, and ECT2 was also 
associated with poor survival and various clinical parameters of the HNSC 
patients. Methylation analysis through targeted bisulfite sequencing of HOK and 
FuDu cell lines revealed that the overexpression of KNTC1, CEP55, AURKA, and 
ECT2 hub genes was due to their promoter hypomethylation. Moreover, higher 
expressions of KNTC1, CEP55, AURKA, and ECT2 were positively correlated with the 
abundance of the CD4+ T cells and macrophage while with the reduction of CD8+ T 
cells in HNSC samples. Finally, gene enrichment analysis showed that all hub 
genes are involved in "nucleoplasm, centrosome, mitotic spindle, and cytosol" 
pathways. In conclusion, the KNTC1, CEP55, AURKA, and ECT2 genes could be 
potential biomarkers for HNSC patients and provide a novel insight into the 
diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

Immunogenic cell death (ICD) serves a critical role in regulating cell death 
adequate to activate an adaptive immune response, and it is associated with 
various inflammation-related diseases. However, the specific role of ICD-related 
genes in COVID-19 remains unclear. We acquired COVID-19-related information from 
the GEO database and a total of 14 ICD-related differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were identified. These ICD-related DEGs were closely associated with 
inflammation and immune activity. Afterward, CASP1, CD4, and EIF2AK3 among the 
14 DEGs were selected as feature genes based on LASSO, Random Forest, and 
SVM-RFE algorithms, which had reliable diagnostic abilities. Moreover, 
functional enrichment analysis indicated that these feature genes may have a 
potential role in COVID-19 by being involved in the regulation of immune 
response and metabolism. Further CIBERSORT analysis demonstrated that the 
variations in the immune microenvironment of COVID-19 patients may be correlated 
with CASP1, CD4, and EIF2AK3. Additionally, 33 drugs targeting 3 feature genes 
had been identified, and the ceRNA network demonstrated a complicated regulative 
association based on these feature genes. Our work identified that CASP1, CD4, 
and EIF2AK3 were diagnostic genes of COVID-19 and correlated with immune 
activity. This study presents a reliable diagnostic signature and offers an 
overview to investigate the mechanism of COVID-19.

The presence of lymph node metastasis (LNM) affects treatment strategy decisions 
in T1NxM0 colorectal cancer (CRC), but the currently used 
clinicopathological-based risk stratification cannot predict LNM accurately. In 
this study, we detected proteins in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 
tumor samples from 143 LNM-negative and 78 LNM-positive patients with T1 CRC and 
revealed changes in molecular and biological pathways by label-free liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and established classifiers 
for predicting LNM in T1 CRC. An effective 55-proteins prediction model was 
built by machine learning and validated in a training cohort (N=132) and two 
validation cohorts (VC1, N=42; VC2, N=47), achieved an impressive AUC of 1.00 in 
the training cohort, 0.96 in VC1 and 0.93 in VC2, respectively. We further built 
a simplified classifier with nine proteins, and achieved an AUC of 0.824. The 
simplified classifier was performed excellently in two external validation 
cohorts. The expression patterns of 13 proteins were confirmed by 
immunohistochemistry, and the IHC score of five proteins was used to build an 
IHC predict model with an AUC of 0.825. RHOT2 silence significantly enhanced 
migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. Our study explored the mechanism 
of metastasis in T1 CRC and can be used to facilitate the individualized 
prediction of LNM in patients with T1 CRC, which may provide a guidance for 
clinical practice in T1 CRC.

Plain Language Summary: Most patients with early-stage colorectal cancer can be 
treated with a minimally invasive procedure. Surgeons use a flexible tool to 
remove precancerous or cancerous cells, cutting the risk of death from 
colorectal cancer in half. But a small number of early-stage colorectal cancer 
patients are at risk of their cancer spreading to the lymph nodes. These 
patients need more extensive surgery. Clinicians use risk stratification tools 
to decide which patients need more extensive surgery. Unfortunately, the 
existing risk stratification tools are not very accurate. The current approach, 
which analyzes colon tissue for cancerous changes, classifies 70% to 80% of 
early-stage colorectal cancer patients as high risk for cancer spread. But only 
about 8% to 16% of patients in the high risk group have lymph node metastasis. 
As a result, many patients undergo unnecessary, invasive surgery. Zhuang, 
Zhuang, Chen, Qin, et al. developed a more accurate way to predict which 
patients are at risk of lymph node metastasis using proteins. In the 
experiments, the team analyzed the proteins in tumor samples from 143 patients 
with early colorectal cancer who did not have lymph node metastases and 78 
patients with metastases. Zhuang et al. then used machine learning to build a 
prediction tool that used 55 proteins to identify patients at risk of 
metastases. The new approach was more accurate than existing tools and 
simplified versions with only nine or five proteins also performed better than 
existing tools. This work provides preliminary evidence that protein-based 
models using as few as five proteins can more accurately identify which patients 
are at risk of metastasis. These models may reduce the number of patients who 
undergo unnecessary invasive surgery. The experiments also identified potential 
targets for therapies to prevent or treat lymph metastases. For example, they 
showed that low levels of the RHOT2 protein predict metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis is iron-dependent non-apoptotic cell death, that is 
characterized by the excessive accumulation of lipid peroxides. 
Ferroptosis-inducing therapy also shows promise in the treatment of cancers. 
However, ferroptosis-inducing therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is still 
in the exploratory stage.
METHODS: We identified the differentially expressed ferroptosis regulators using 
Mann-Whitney U test in the proteome data from Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis 
Consortium (CPTAC). We next analyzed the effect of mutation on protein 
abundance. A multivariate Cox model was constructed to identify the prognostic 
signature.
RESULTS: In this study, we systemically portrayed the proteogenomic landscape of 
ferroptosis regulators in GBM. We observed that some mutation-specific 
ferroptosis regulators, such as down-regulated ACSL4 in EGFR-mutated patients 
and up-regulated FADS2 in IDH1-mutated patients, were linked to the inhibited 
ferroptosis activity in GBM. To interrogate the valuable treatment targets, we 
performed the survival analysis and identified five ferroptosis regulators 
(ACSL3, HSPB1, ELAVL1, IL33, and GPX4) as the prognostic biomarkers. We also 
validated their efficiency in external validation cohorts. Notably, we found 
overexpressed protein and phosphorylation abundances of HSPB1 were poor 
prognosis markers for overall survival of GBM to inhibit ferroptosis activity. 
Alternatively, HSPB1 showed a significant association with macrophage 
infiltration levels. Macrophage-secreted SPP1 could be a potential activator for 
HSPB1 in glioma cells. Finally, we recognized that ipatasertib, a novel pan-Akt 
inhibitor, could be a potential drug for suppressing HSPB1 phosphorylation, 
inducing ferroptosis of glioma cells.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our study characterized the proteogenomic landscape of 
ferroptosis regulators and identified that HSPB1 could be a candidate target for 
ferroptosis-inducing therapy strategy for GBM.

Many signaling and other genes known as "hidden" drivers may not be genetically 
or epigenetically altered or differentially expressed at the mRNA or protein 
levels, but, rather, drive a phenotype such as tumorigenesis via 
post-translational modification or other mechanisms. However, conventional 
approaches based on genomics or differential expression are limited in exposing 
such hidden drivers. Here, we present a comprehensive algorithm and toolkit 
NetBID2 (data-driven network-based Bayesian inference of drivers, version 2), 
which reverse-engineers context-specific interactomes and integrates network 
activity inferred from large-scale multi-omics data, empowering the 
identification of hidden drivers that could not be detected by traditional 
analyses. NetBID2 has substantially re-engineered the previous prototype version 
by providing versatile data visualization and sophisticated statistical 
analyses, which strongly facilitate researchers for result interpretation 
through end-to-end multi-omics data analysis. We demonstrate the power of 
NetBID2 using three hidden driver examples. We deploy NetBID2 Viewer, Runner, 
and Cloud apps with 145 context-specific gene regulatory and signaling networks 
across normal tissues and paediatric and adult cancers to facilitate end-to-end 
analysis, real-time interactive visualization and cloud-based data sharing.

BACKGROUND: Chronic morphine usage induces lasting molecular and microcellular 
adaptations in distinct brain areas, resulting in addiction-related behavioural 
abnormalities, drug-seeking, and relapse. Nonetheless, the mechanisms of action 
of the genes responsible for morphine addiction have not been exhaustively 
studied.
METHODS: We obtained morphine addiction-related datasets from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and screened for Differentially Expressed 
Genes (DEGs). Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) functional 
modularity constructs were analyzed for genes associated with clinical traits. 
Venn diagrams were filtered for intersecting common DEGs (CDEGs). Gene Ontology 
(GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathway enrichment analysis for functional annotation. Protein-protein 
interaction network (PPI) and CytoHubba were used to screen for hub genes. 
Potential treatments for morphine addiction were figured out with the help of an 
online database.
RESULTS: Sixty-five common differential genes linked to morphine addiction were 
identified, and functional enrichment analysis showed that they were primarily 
involved in ion channel activity, protein transport, the oxytocin signalling 
pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, and other signalling 
pathways. Based on the PPI network, ten hub genes (CHN2, OLIG2, UGT8A, CACNB2, 
TIMP3, FKBP5, ZBTB16, TSC22D3, ISL1, and SLC2A1) were checked. In the data set 
GSE7762, all of the Area Under Curve (AUC) values for the hub gene Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were greater than 0.8. We also used the 
DGIdb database to look for eight small-molecule drugs that might be useful for 
treating morphine addiction.
CONCLUSIONS: The hub genes are crucial genes associated with morphine addiction 
in the mouse striatum. The oxytocin signalling pathway may play a vital role in 
developing morphine addiction.

In addition to vaccines, the World Health Organization sees novel medications as 
an urgent matter to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. One possible strategy 
is to identify target proteins, for which a perturbation by an existing compound 
is likely to benefit COVID-19 patients. In order to contribute to this effort, 
we present GuiltyTargets-COVID-19 ( https://guiltytargets-covid.eu/ ), a machine 
learning supported web tool to identify novel candidate drug targets. Using six 
bulk and three single cell RNA-Seq datasets, together with a lung tissue 
specific protein-protein interaction network, we demonstrate that 
GuiltyTargets-COVID-19 is capable of (i) prioritizing meaningful target 
candidates and assessing their druggability, (ii) unraveling their linkage to 
known disease mechanisms, (iii) mapping ligands from the ChEMBL database to the 
identified targets, and (iv) pointing out potential side effects in the case 
that the mapped ligands correspond to approved drugs. Our example analyses 
identified 4 potential drug targets from the datasets: AKT3 from both the bulk 
and single cell RNA-Seq data as well as AKT2, MLKL, and MAPK11 in the single 
cell experiments. Altogether, we believe that our web tool will facilitate 
future target identification and drug development for COVID-19, notably in a 
cell type and tissue specific manner.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive 
malignancy associated with rapid progression and an abysmal prognosis. Previous 
research has shown that chronic pancreatitis can significantly increase the risk 
of developing PDAC. The overarching hypothesis is that some of the biological 
processes disrupted during the inflammatory stage tend to show significant 
dysregulation, even in cancer. This might explain why chronic inflammation 
increases the risk of carcinogenesis and uncontrolled proliferation. Here, we 
try to pinpoint such complex processes by comparing the expression profiles of 
pancreatitis and PDAC tissues.
METHODS: We analyzed a total of six gene expression datasets retrieved from the 
EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress and NCBI GEO databases, which included 306 PDAC, 68 
pancreatitis and 172 normal pancreatic samples. The disrupted genes identified 
were used to perform downstream analysis for ontology, interaction, enriched 
pathways, potential druggability, promoter methylation, and the associated 
prognostic value. Further, we performed expression analysis based on gender, 
patient's drinking habit, race, and pancreatitis status.
RESULTS: Our study identified 45 genes with altered expression levels shared 
between PDAC and pancreatitis. Over-representation analysis revealed that 
protein digestion and absorption, ECM-receptor interaction, PI3k-Akt signaling, 
and proteoglycans in cancer pathways as significantly enriched. Module analysis 
identified 15 hub genes, of which 14 were found to be in the druggable genome 
category.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we have identified critical genes and various 
biochemical processes disrupted at a molecular level. These results can provide 
valuable insights into certain events leading to carcinogenesis, and therefore 
help identify novel therapeutic targets to improve PDAC treatment in the future.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the two solid malignancies in which a higher T 
cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) corresponds with a worse 
prognosis for the tumor. The inability of T cells to eliminate tumor cells 
despite an increase in their number reinforces the possibility of impaired 
antigen presentation. In this study, we investigated the TME at single-cell 
resolution to understand the molecular function and communication of dendritic 
cells (DCs) (as professional antigen-presenting cells). According to our data, 
tumor cells stimulate the migration of immature DCs to the tumor site by 
inducing inflammatory chemokines. Many signaling pathways such as TNF-α/NF-κB, 
IL2/STAT5, and E2F up-regulated after DCs enter the tumor location. In addition, 
some molecules such as GPR34 and SLCO2B1 decreased on the surface of DCs. The 
analysis of molecular and signaling alterations in DCs revealed some suppression 
mechanisms of tumors, such as removing mature DCs, reducing the DC's survival, 
inducing anergy or exhaustion in the effector T cells, and enhancing the 
differentiation of T cells to Th2 and Tregs. In addition, we investigated the 
cellular and molecular communication between DCs and macrophages in the tumor 
site and found three molecular pairs including CCR5/CCL5, CD52/SIGLEC10, and 
HLA-DPB1/TNFSF13B. These molecular pairs are involved in the migration of 
immature DCs to the TME and disrupt the antigen-presenting function of DCs. 
Furthermore, we presented new therapeutic targets by the construction of a gene 
co-expression network. These data increase our knowledge of the heterogeneity 
and the role of DCs in PCa TME.

The identification and characterization of plasma proteins in drug resistant and 
drug sensitive in HIV-1 infected/AIDS patients were carried out using the 
SWATH-MS protocol. In total, 204 proteins were identified and quantified, 57 
proteins were differentially expressed, out of which 25 proteins were down 
regulated and 32 proteins were up regulated in drug resistant patients. Six 
proteins such as complement C4-A, immunoglobulin heavy variable 1-2, carboxylic 
ester hydrolase, fibulin-1, immunoglobulin lambda constant7, secreted 
phosphoprotein 24 were differentially expressed in individuals with drug 
resistant HIV as compared to individuals with drug sensitive HIV. Gene ontology 
of 57 differentially expressed proteins was analysed and documented.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent dementia disorder globally, and 
there are still no effective interventions for slowing or stopping the 
underlying pathogenic mechanisms. There is strong evidence implicating neural 
oxidative stress (OS) and ensuing neuroinflammation in the progressive 
neurodegeneration observed in the AD brain both during and prior to symptom 
emergence. Thus, OS-related biomarkers may be valuable for prognosis and provide 
clues to therapeutic targets during the early presymptomatic phase. In the 
current study, we gathered brain RNA-seq data of AD patients and matched 
controls from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify differentially 
expressed OS-related genes (OSRGs). These OSRGs were analyzed for cellular 
functions using the Gene Ontology (GO) database and used to construct a weighted 
gene co-expression network (WGCN) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were then constructed to identify 
network hub genes. A diagnostic model was established based on these hub genes 
using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and ROC analyses. 
Immune-related functions were examined by assessing correlations between hub 
gene expression and immune cell brain infiltration scores. Further, target drugs 
were predicted using the Drug-Gene Interaction database, while regulatory miRNAs 
and transcription factors were predicted using miRNet. In total, 156 candidate 
genes were identified among 11046 differentially expressed genes, 7098 genes in 
WGCN modules, and 446 OSRGs, and 5 hub genes (MAPK9, FOXO1, BCL2, ETS1, and SP1) 
were identified by ROC curve analyses. These hub genes were enriched in GO 
annotations "Alzheimer's disease pathway," "Parkinson's Disease," "Ribosome," 
and "Chronic myeloid leukemia." In addition, 78 drugs were predicted to target 
FOXO1, SP1, MAPK9, and BCL2, including fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and 
epirubicin. A hub gene-miRNA regulatory network with 43 miRNAs and hub 
gene-transcription factor (TF) network with 36 TFs were also generated. These 
hub genes may serve as biomarkers for AD diagnosis and provide clues to novel 
potential treatment targets.

BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology 
affecting mainly children. Studies have shown that the pathogenesis of KD may be 
related to autophagy. Using bioinformatics analysis, we assessed the 
significance of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in KD.
METHODS: Common ARGs were identified from the GeneCards Database, the Molecular 
Signatures Database (MSigDB), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. 
ARGs were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
analysis. Furthermore, related microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors (TFs), 
and drug interaction network were predicted. The immune cell infiltration of 
ARGs in tissues was explored. Finally, we used receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to validate the diagnostic 
value and expression levels of ARGs in KD.
RESULTS: There were 20 ARGs in total. GO analysis showed that ARGs were mainly 
rich in autophagy, macro-autophagy, and GTPase activity. KEGG analysis showed 
that ARGs were mainly rich in autophagy-animal and the collecting duct acid 
secretion pathway. The expression of WIPI1, WDFY3, ATP6V0E2, RALB, ATP6V1C1, 
GBA, C9orf72, LRRK2, GNAI3, and PIK3CB is the focus of PPI network. A total of 
72 related miRNAs and 130 related TFs were predicted by miRNA and TF targeting 
network analyses. Ten pairs of gene-drug interaction networks were also 
predicted; immune infiltration analysis showed that SH3GLB1, ATP6V0E2, PLEKHF1, 
RALB, KLHL3, and TSPO were closely related to CD8 + T cells and neutrophils. The 
ROC curve showed that ARGs had good diagnostic value in KD. qRT-PCR showed that 
WIPI1 and GBA were significantly upregulated.
CONCLUSION: Twenty potential ARGs were identified by bioinformatics analysis, 
and WIPI1 and GBA may be used as potential drug targets and biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) is a rare type of cancer that 
settles at the meninges through metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), breast cancer and melanoma. The molecular mechanism underlying LMC is 
not known, therefore molecular studies investigating the development of LMC are 
needed. Here, we aimed to identify commonly mutated genes in LMC caused by 
NSCLC, breast cancer, and melanoma using an in-slico approach and their 
interactions using integrated bioinformatic approaches/tools in this 
meta-analysis.
METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis using information from 16 studies that 
included different sequencing techniques of patients with LMC caused by three 
different primary cancers: breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. All studies that 
assessed mutation information from patients with LMC were searched in PubMed, 
from their inception to February, 16 2022. Studies that performed NGS on LMC 
patients with NSCLC, breast cancer, or melanoma were included, while studies 
that did not apply NGS to CSF samples, did not provide information on altered 
genes, were reviews, editorials, or conference abstracts, or whose main goal was 
the detection of malignancies were all excluded. We identified commonly mutated 
genes in all three types of cancer. Next, we constructed a protein-protein 
interaction network, then performed pathway enrichment analysis. We searched 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) 
to find candidate drugs.
RESULTS: We found that TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA, IL7R, and KMT2D genes were commonly 
mutated genes in all three types of cancer via our meta-analysis that consisted 
out of 16 studies. Our pathway enrichment analysis showed that all five genes 
were primarily associated with regulation of cell communication and signaling, 
and cell proliferation. Other enriched pathways included regulation of apoptotic 
processes of leukocytes and fibroblasts, macroautophagy and growth. According to 
our drug search we found candidate drugs; Everolimus, Bevacizumab and 
Temozolomide, which interact with these five genes.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a total of 96 mutated genes in LMC were investigated 
via meta-analysis. Our findings suggested vital roles of TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA, 
KMT2D, and IL7R, which can provide insight into the molecular basis of LMC 
development and paving the door to the development of new targeted medicine and 
will encourage molecular biologists to seek biological evidence.

BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common hematologic malignancy 
characterized by poor prognoses and high recurrence rates. Mitochondrial 
metabolism has been increasingly recognized to be crucial in tumor progression 
and treatment resistance. The purpose of this study was to examined the role of 
mitochondrial metabolism in the immune regulation and prognosis of AML.
METHODS: In this study, mutation status of 31 mitochondrial metabolism-related 
genes (MMRGs) in AML were analyzed. Based on the expression of 31 MMRGs, 
mitochondrial metabolism scores (MMs) were calculated by single sample gene set 
enrichment analysis. Differential analysis and weighted co-expression network 
analysis were performed to identify module MMRGs. Next, univariate Cox 
regression and the least absolute and selection operator regression were used to 
select prognosis-associated MMRGs. A prognosis model was then constructed using 
multivariate Cox regression to calculate risk score. We validated the expression 
of key MMRGs in clinical specimens using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Then 
differential analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) between high- and low-risk groups. Functional enrichment, interaction 
networks, drug sensitivity, immune microenvironment, and immunotherapy analyses 
were also performed to explore the characteristic of DEGs.
RESULTS: Given the association of MMs with prognosis of AML patients, a 
prognosis model was constructed based on 5 MMRGs, which could accurately 
distinguish high-risk patients from low-risk patients in both training and 
validation datasets. IHC results showed that MMRGs were highly expressed in AML 
samples compared to normal samples. Additionally, the 38 DEGs were mainly 
related to mitochondrial metabolism, immune signaling, and multiple drug 
resistance pathways. In addition, high-risk patients with more immune-cell 
infiltration had higher Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion scores, 
indicating poor immunotherapy response. mRNA-drug interactions and drug 
sensitivity analyses were performed to explore potential druggable hub genes. 
Furthermore, we combined risk score with age and gender to construct a prognosis 
model, which could predict the prognosis of AML patients.
CONCLUSION: Our study provided a prognostic predictor for AML patients and 
revealed that mitochondrial metabolism is associated with immune regulation and 
drug resistant in AML, providing vital clues for immunotherapies.

Canine pyometra, which is accompanied by bacterial contamination of the dog 
uterus, is defined as a complex disease associated with the activation of 
several systems, including the immune system. This study uses text mining and 
microarray data analysis methods to discover some existing targeted gene drugs 
and expand potential new drug indications. Text mining ("canine pyometra") and 
microarray data analysis (GSE99877) were used to obtain a common set of genes. 
These genes and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were analyzed using 
Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Then, the 
important genes clustered in the PPI network were selected for gene-drug 
interaction analysis to provide evidence for potential drug discovery. Through 
text mining and data analysis, we obtained 17,544 text mining genes (TMGs) and 
399 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. There were 256 repeat 
genes between TMGs and DEGs, including 70 upregulated genes and 186 
downregulated genes. Thirty-seven genes clustered in three significant gene 
modules. Eight of the 37 genes can target 23 existing drugs. In conclusion, the 
discovery of 8 immune response-related genes (BTK, CSF2RA, CSF2RB, ITGAL, NCF4, 
PLCG2, PTPRC, and TOP2A) targeting 23 existing drugs may expand the drug 
indications for pyometra-related diseases in dogs.

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) is one of the most lethal 
malignancies around the globe. Due to its complex nature, the diagnostic and 
prognostic signatures of HNSC remain poorly understood. This study was launched 
to identify signature genes and their signaling pathways related to the 
development of HNSC. In the current study, we retrieved the GSE53819 dataset 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to determine the differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) using the "Limma" R package. Adjusted P values P < 0.05 
and |logFC| ≥ 1 were selected as the filtering conditions. To identify hub 
genes, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction of the DEGs 
was performed using STRING. We further used UALCAN, GEPIA, OncoDB, GENT2, 
MEXPRESS, and HPA databases for the expression, validation, survival, and 
methylation analyses of the hub genes. The cBioPortal tool was used to 
investigate the genetic alterations in hub genes. CancerSEA, TIMER, DAVID, 
ENCORI, and DrugBank were also used to explore a few more hub gene-associated 
parameters. Lastly, HOK, FaDu, and SCC25 cell lines were used to validate hub 
gene expression via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technique. A total of top 250 DEGs 
were selected for detailed analysis in this study. From these DEGs, prognostic 
and diagnostic associated four hub genes, which could serve as potential 
molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HNSC patients were identified. 
Four hub genes, including down-regulated DNAH1 and DNALI1, while up-regulated 
DNAH9 and CCDC151 were strongly implicated in HNSC. We also validated the same 
expression pattern of the hub genes using RNA-seq analysis in HNSC and normal 
cell lines. Moreover, this study also revealed some novel links between DNAH1, 
DNALI1, DNAH9, and CCDC151 expression and genetic alterations, promoter 
methylation status, immune cell infiltration, miRNAs, gene enrichment terms, and 
various chemotherapeutic drugs. In conclusion, we indicated four hub genes 
(DNAH1, DNALI1, DNAH9, and CCDC151) and their associated signaling pathways, 
which may improve our understanding of HNSC and could be used as new therapeutic 
targets.

Though significant improvements have been made in the treatment methods for 
ovarian cancer (OC), the prognosis for OC patients is still poor. Exploring hub 
genes associated with the development of OC and utilizing them as appropriate 
potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets is highly valuable. In this study, 
the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from an independent 
GSE69428 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset between OC and control samples. 
The DEGs were processed to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network using STRING. Later, hub genes were identified through Cytohubba 
analysis of the Cytoscape. Expression and survival profiling of the hub genes 
were validated using GEPIA, OncoDB, and GENT2. For exploring promoter 
methylation levels and genetic alterations in hub genes, MEXPRESS and cBioPortal 
were utilized, respectively. Moreover, DAVID, HPA, TIMER, CancerSEA, ENCORI, 
DrugBank, and GSCAlite were used for gene enrichment analysis, subcellular 
localization analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, exploring correlations 
between hub genes and different diverse states, lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-regulatory 
network analysis, predicting hub gene-associated drugs, and conducting drug 
sensitivity analysis, respectively. In total, 8947 DEGs were found between OC 
and normal samples in GSE69428. After STRING and Cytohubba analysis, 4 hub genes 
including TTK (TTK Protein Kinase), (BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine 
kinase B) BUB1B, (Nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1) NUSAP1, and (ZW10 
interacting kinetochore protein) ZWINT were selected as the hub genes. Further, 
it was validated that these 4 hub genes were significantly up-regulated in OC 
samples compared to normal controls, but overexpression of these genes was not 
associated with overall survival (OS). However, genetic alterations in those 
genes were found to be linked with OS and disease-free (DFS) survival. Moreover, 
this study also revealed some novel links between TTK, BUB1B, NUSAP1, and ZWINT 
overexpression and promoter methylation status, immune cell infiltration, 
miRNAs, gene enrichment terms, and various chemotherapeutic drugs. Four hub 
genes, including TTK, BUB1B, NUSAP1, and ZWINT, were revealed as tumor-promotive 
factors in OC, having the potential to be utilized as novel biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets for OC management.

Growing evidences have suggested the association between coronavirus infection 
and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanism behind the 
association is complex and remains to be clarified. This study integrated human 
genes involved in infections of three coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, 
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from multi-omics data, and investigated the shared genes 
and molecular functions between coronavirus infection and two neurodegenerative 
diseases, namely Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Seven 
genes including HSP90AA1, ALDH2, CAV1, COMT, MTOR, IGF2R and HSPA1A, and several 
inflammation and stress response-related molecular functions such as MAPK 
signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, responses to oxidative or 
chemical stress were common to both coronavirus infection and neurodegenerative 
diseases. These genes were further found to interact with more than 20 other 
viruses. Finally, drugs targeting these genes were identified. The study would 
not only help clarify the molecular mechanism behind the association between 
coronavirus infection and neurodegenerative diseases, but also provide novel 
targets for the development of broad-spectrum drugs against both coronaviruses 
and neurodegenerative diseases.

OBJECTIVES: To present an unbiased approach to identify positional transcript 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of osteoarthritis (OA) risk loci by 
allelic expression imbalance (AEI) analyses using RNA sequencing of articular 
cartilage and subchondral bone from OA patients.
METHODS: RNA sequencing from 65 articular cartilage and 24 subchondral bone from 
OA patients was used for AEI analysis. AEI was determined for all genes present 
in the 100 regions reported by the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
catalog that were also expressed in cartilage or bone. The count fraction of the 
alternative allele (φ) was calculated for each heterozygous individual with the 
risk SNP or with the SNP in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with it (r2 > 0.6). 
Furthermore, a meta-analysis was performed to generate a meta-φ (null hypothesis 
median φ = 0.49) and P-value for each SNP.
RESULTS: We identified 30 transcript SNPs (28 in cartilage and two in 
subchondral bone) subject to AEI in 29 genes. Notably, 10 transcript SNPs were 
located in genes not previously reported in the GWAS catalog, including two long 
intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), MALAT1 (meta-φ = 0.54, FDR = 1.7×10-4) 
and ILF3-DT (meta-φ = 0.6, FDR = 1.75×10-5). Moreover, 12 drugs were interacting 
with seven genes displaying AEI, of which seven drugs have been already 
approved.
CONCLUSIONS: By prioritizing proxy transcript SNPs that mark AEI in cartilage 
and/or subchondral bone at loci harbouring GWAS signals, we present an unbiased 
approach to identify the most likely functional OA risk-SNP and gene. We 
identified 10 new potential OA risk genes ready for further translation towards 
underlying biological mechanisms.

The world has recently been plagued by a new coronavirus infection called 
SARS-CoV-2. This virus may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome followed by 
multiple organ failure. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 80-90% genetic similarity 
to SARS-CoV. Given the limited omics data available for host response to the 
viruses (more limited data for SARS-CoV-2), we attempted to unveil the crucial 
molecular mechanisms underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by comparing its 
regulatory network motifs with SARS-CoV. We also attempted to identify the 
non-shared crucial molecules and their functions to predict the specific 
mechanisms for each infection and the processes responsible for their different 
manifestations. Deciphering the crucial shared and non-shared mechanisms at the 
molecular level and signaling pathways underlying both diseases may help shed 
light on their pathogenesis and pave the way for other new drug repurposing 
against COVID-19. We constructed the GRNs for host response to SARS-CoV and 
SARS-CoV-2 pathogens (in vitro) and identified the significant 3-node regulatory 
motifs by analyzing them topologically and functionally. We attempted to 
identify the shared and non-shared regulatory elements and signaling pathways 
between their host responses. Interestingly, our findings indicated that NFKB1, 
JUN, STAT1, FOS, KLF4, and EGR1 were the critical shared TFs between 
motif-related subnetworks in both SARS and COVID-1, which are considered genes 
with specific functions in the immune response. Enrichment analysis revealed 
that the NOD-like receptor signaling, TNF signaling, and influenza A pathway 
were among the first significant pathways shared between SARS and COVID-19 
up-regulated DEGs networks, and the term "metabolic pathways" (hsa01100) among 
the down-regulated DEGs networks. WEE1, PMAIP1, and TSC22D2 were identified as 
the top three hubs specific to SARS. However, MYPN, SPRY4, and APOL6 were the 
tops specific to COVID-19 in vitro. The term "Complement and coagulation 
cascades" pathway was identified as the first top non-shared pathway for 
COVID-19 and the MAPK signaling pathway for SARS. We used the identified crucial 
DEGs to construct a drug-gene interaction network to propose some drug 
candidates. Zinc chloride, Fostamatinib, Copper, Tirofiban, Tretinoin, and 
Levocarnitine were the six drugs with higher scores in our drug-gene network 
analysis.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract, and glaucoma are leading 
causes of blindness worldwide. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
have revealed a variety of susceptible loci associated with age-related ocular 
disorders, yet the genetic pleiotropy and causal genes across these diseases 
remain poorly understood. By leveraging large-scale genetic and observational 
data from ocular disease GWASs and UK Biobank (UKBB), we found significant 
pairwise genetic correlations and consistent epidemiological associations among 
these ocular disorders. Cross-disease meta-analysis uncovered seven pleiotropic 
loci, three of which were replicated in an additional cohort. Integration of 
variants in pleiotropic loci and multiple single-cell omics data identified that 
Müller cells and astrocytes were likely trait-related cell types underlying 
ocular comorbidity. In addition, we comprehensively integrated eye-specific gene 
expression quantitative loci (eQTLs), epigenomic profiling, and 3D genome data 
to prioritize causal pleiotropic genes. We found that pleiotropic genes were 
essential in nerve development and eye pigmentation, and targetable by 
aflibercept and pilocarpine for the treatment of AMD and glaucoma. These 
findings will not only facilitate the mechanistic research of ocular 
comorbidities but also benefit the therapeutic optimization of age-related 
ocular diseases.

Background: Stroke and depression are the two most common causes of disability 
worldwide. Growing evidence suggests a bi-directional relationship between 
stroke and depression, whereas the molecular mechanisms underlying stroke and 
depression are not well understood. The objectives of this study were to 
identify hub genes and biological pathways related to the pathogenesis of 
ischemic stroke (IS) and major depressive disorder (MDD) and to evaluate the 
infiltration of immune cells in both disorders. Methods: Participants from the 
United States National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) 
2005-2018 were included to evaluate the association between stroke and MDD. Two 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) sets extracted from GSE98793 and GSE16561 
datasets were intersected to generate common DEGs, which were further screened 
out in cytoHubba to identify hub genes. GO, KEGG, Metascape, GeneMANIA, 
NetworkAnalyst, and DGIdb were used for functional enrichment, pathway analysis, 
regulatory network analysis, and candidate drugs analysis. ssGSEA algorithm was 
used to analyze the immune infiltration. Results: Among the 29706 participants 
from NHANES 2005-2018, stroke was significantly associated with MDD (OR = 
2.79,95% CI:2.26-3.43, p < 0.0001). A total of 41 common upregulated genes and 
eight common downregulated genes were finally identified between IS and MDD. 
Enrichment analysis revealed that the shared genes were mainly involved in 
immune response and immune-related pathways. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
was constructed, from which ten (CD163, AEG1, IRAK3, S100A12, HP, PGLYRP1, 
CEACAM8, MPO, LCN2, and DEFA4) were screened. In addition, gene-miRNAs, 
transcription factor-gene interactions, and protein-drug interactions 
coregulatory networks with hub genes were also identified. Finally, we observed 
that the innate immunity was activated while acquired immunity was suppressed in 
both disorders. Conclusion: We successfully identified the ten hub shared genes 
linking the IS and MDD and constructed the regulatory networks for them that 
could serve as novel targeted therapy for the comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Scleritis is a serious inflammatory eye disease that can lead to 
blindness. The etiology and pathogenesis of scleritis remain unclear, and 
increasing evidence indicates that some specific genes and proteins are 
involved. This study aimed to identify pivotal genes and drug targets for 
scleritis, thus providing new directions for the treatment of this disease.
METHODS: We screened candidate genes and proteins associated with scleritis by 
text-mining the PubMed database using Python, and assessed their functions by 
using the DAVID database. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) analyses were used to identify the functional enrichment of these 
genes and proteins. Then, the hub genes were identified with CytoHubba and 
assessed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. And the serum 
from patients with active scleritis and healthy subjects were used for the 
validation of hub genes. Finally, the DGIdb database was used to predict 
targeted drugs for the hub genes for treating scleritis.
RESULTS: A total of 56 genes and proteins were found to be linked to scleritis, 
and 65 significantly altered pathways were identified in the KEGG analysis (FDR 
< 0.05). Most of the top five pathways involved the categories "Rheumatoid 
arthritis," "Inflammatory bowel disease", "Type I diabetes mellitus," and 
"Graft-versus-host disease". TNF and IL6 were considered to be the top 2 hub 
genes through CytoHubba. Based on our serum samples, hub genes are expressed at 
high levels in active scleritis. Five scleritis-targeting drugs were found among 
88 identified drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides key genes and drug targets related to scleritis 
through bioinformatics analysis. TNF and IL6 are considered key mediators and 
possible drug targets of scleritis. Five drug candidates may play an important 
role in the diagnosis and treatment of scleritis in the future, which is worthy 
of the further experimental and clinical study.

BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized 
by extensive skin fibrosis. There are no effective treatments due to the 
severity, multiorgan presentation, and variable outcomes of the disease. Here, 
integrated bioinformatics was employed to discover tissue-specific expressed hub 
genes associated with SSc, determine potential competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) 
regulatory networks, and identify potential targeted drugs.
METHODS: In this study, four datasets of SSc were acquired. To identify the 
genes specific to tissues or organs, the BioGPS web database was used. For 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional and enrichment analyses were 
carried out, and hub genes were screened and shown in a network of 
protein-protein interactions (PPI). The potential lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA 
network was constructed using the online databases. The specifically expressed 
hub genes and ceRNA network were validated in the SSc mouse and in normal mice. 
We also used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine the 
diagnostic values of effective biomarkers in SSc. Finally, the Drug-Gene 
Interaction Database (DGIdb) identified specific medicines linked to hub genes.
RESULTS: The pooled datasets identified a total of 254 DEGs. The 
tissue/organ-specifically expressed genes involved in this analysis are commonly 
found in the hematologic/immune system and bone/muscle tissue. The enrichment 
analysis of DEGs revealed the significant terms such as regulation of actin 
cytoskeleton, immune-related processes, the VEGF signaling pathway, and 
metabolism. Cytoscape identified six gene cluster modules and 23 hub genes. And 
4 hub genes were identified, including Serpine1, CCL2, IL6, and ISG15. 
Consistently, the expression of Serpine1, CCL2, IL6, and ISG15 was significantly 
higher in the SSc mouse model than in normal mice. Eventually, we found that 
MALAT1-miR-206-CCL2, let-7a-5p-IL6, and miR-196a-5p-SERPINE1 may be promising 
RNA regulatory pathways in SSc. Besides, ten potential therapeutic drugs 
associated with the hub gene were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed tissue-specific expressed genes, SERPINE1, 
CCL2, IL6, and ISG15, as effective biomarkers and provided new insight into the 
mechanisms of SSc. Potential RNA regulatory pathways, including 
MALAT1-miR-206-CCL2, let-7a-5p-IL6, and miR-196a-5p-SERPINE1, contribute to our 
knowledge of SSc. Furthermore, the analysis of drug-hub gene interactions 
predicted TIPLASININ, CARLUMAB and BINDARIT as candidate drugs for SSc.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often 
present with atrial fibrillation (AF), but the common pathophysiological 
mechanisms between the two are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the 
common biological mechanisms of COPD and AF and to search for important 
biomarkers through bioinformatic analysis of public RNA sequencing databases.
METHODS: Four datasets of COPD and AF were downloaded from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database. The overlapping genes common to both diseases were 
screened by WGCNA analysis, followed by protein-protein interaction network 
construction and functional enrichment analysis to elucidate the common 
mechanisms of COPD and AF. Machine learning algorithms were also used to 
identify key biomarkers. Co-expression analysis, "transcription factor 
(TF)-mRNA-microRNA (miRNA)" regulatory networks and drug prediction were 
performed for key biomarkers. Finally, immune cell infiltration analysis was 
performed to evaluate further the immune cell changes in the COPD dataset and 
the correlation between key biomarkers and immune cells.
RESULTS: A total of 133 overlapping genes for COPD and AF were obtained, and the 
enrichment was mainly focused on pathways associated with the inflammatory 
immune response. A key biomarker, cyclin dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), was 
identified through screening by machine learning algorithms and validated in the 
validation dataset. Twenty potential drugs capable of targeting CDK8 were 
obtained. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed the presence of multiple 
immune cell dysregulation in COPD. Correlation analysis showed that CDK8 
expression was significantly associated with CD8+ T cells, resting dendritic 
cell, macrophage M2, and monocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the role of the inflammatory immune response 
in COPD combined with AF. The prominent link between CDK8 and the inflammatory 
immune response and its characteristic of not affecting the basal expression 
level of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) make it a possible promising therapeutic 
target for COPD combined with AF.

AIM: It is to be elucidated the risk-predictive role of differentially expressed 
fatty acid metabolism related genes (DE-FRGs) in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) 
and myocardial infarction.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Four gene enrichment analyses defined DE-FRGs' biological 
functions and pathways. Three strategies were applied to identify risk 
biomarkers and construct a nomogram. The 4-DE-FRG correlation with immune cell 
infiltration, drugs, and ceRNA was explored.
RESULTS: DE-FRGs were enriched in lipid metabolism. A risk nomogram was 
established by ACSL1, ALDH2, CYP27A1 and PPARA, demonstrating a good ability for 
DCM and myocardial infarction prediction. PPARA was positively correlated with 
adaptive immunocytes. Thirty-five drugs are candidate therapeutic targets.
CONCLUSION: A nomogram and new biological targets for early diagnosis and 
treatment of DCM and myocardial infarction were provided.

Plain Language Summary: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and myocardial infarction 
(MI) are two common types of heart disease. This study investigated the fatty 
acid metabolism related genes to predict the risk of DCM or MI. Four of them 
(ACSL1, ALDH2, CYP27A1 and PPARA) were effective in predicting disease risk. 
Additionally, PPARA was found to be associated with immune cell infiltration, 
and 35 drugs emerged as potential therapeutic targets for these diseases. This 
study may provide insights into the early diagnosis and treatment of DCM and MI.

The EWSR1::CREM fusion gene, caused by a chromosomal translocation 
t(10;22)(p11;q12), has been discovered in divergent malignancies, ranging from 
low-grade to highly malignant cancers. The translocation gives rise to a 
chimeric protein, EWSR1::CREM. The molecular mechanisms behind the oncogenic 
properties of the EWSR1::CREM protein have not previously been systematically 
characterized. In this study, we performed transcriptional profiling of the 
melanoma cell line CHL-1, with depletion of endogenous EWSR1::CREM protein using 
siRNA mediated knockdown. We found that the expression of 712 genes was altered 
(Log2 fold-change ≥ 2). We performed pathway analysis to identify EWSR1::CREM 
mediated pathways and cell studies to examine functional differences brought 
upon by the knockdown. Altered pathways involved cell cycle and proliferation, 
this was further validated by the cell studies where cell migration was affected 
as well. Among the target genes with the greatest downregulation, we discovered 
ODC1-a well-established oncogenic enzyme that can be pharmacologically inhibited 
and is essential for polyamine synthesis. We found that the main effects seen 
upon EWSR1::CREM knockdown can be reproduced by directly silencing ODC1 
expression. These findings provide novel insights into pathogenesis of tumors 
harboring a EWSR1::CREM fusion gene, hopefully facilitating the development of 
novel therapeutic strategies.

One of the main obstacles to the successful treatment of cancer is the 
phenomenon of drug resistance. A common strategy to overcome resistance is the 
use of combination therapies. However, the space of possibilities is huge and 
efficient search strategies are required. Machine Learning (ML) can be a useful 
tool for the discovery of novel, clinically relevant anti-cancer drug 
combinations. In particular, deep learning (DL) has become a popular choice for 
modeling drug combination effects. Here, we set out to examine the impact of 
different methodological choices on the performance of multimodal DL-based drug 
synergy prediction methods, including the use of different input data types, 
preprocessing steps and model architectures. Focusing on the NCI ALMANAC 
dataset, we found that feature selection based on prior biological knowledge has 
a positive impact-limiting gene expression data to cancer or drug 
response-specific genes improved performance. Drug features appeared to be more 
predictive of drug response, with a 41% increase in coefficient of determination 
(R2) and 26% increase in Spearman correlation relative to a baseline model that 
used only cell line and drug identifiers. Molecular fingerprint-based drug 
representations performed slightly better than learned representations-ECFP4 
fingerprints increased R2 by 5.3% and Spearman correlation by 2.8% w.r.t the 
best learned representations. In general, fully connected feature-encoding 
subnetworks outperformed other architectures. DL outperformed other ML methods 
by more than 35% (R2) and 14% (Spearman). Additionally, an ensemble combining 
the top DL and ML models improved performance by about 6.5% (R2) and 4% 
(Spearman). Using a state-of-the-art interpretability method, we showed that DL 
models can learn to associate drug and cell line features with drug response in 
a biologically meaningful way. The strategies explored in this study will help 
to improve the development of computational methods for the rational design of 
effective drug combinations for cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Renal ischemia reperfusion injuries (IRIs) are very common in 
clinical diagnoses and treatments, which are a common cause of impaired renal 
functions, worsening pathological damage, affecting disease progression and 
hindering recovery. Renal IRIs are an inflammatory disease mediated by the 
adaptive and innate immune system. There is a complex interaction between 
oxidative stress and immune cell infiltration. Therefore, we aimed to determine 
biomarkers associated with oxidative stress during renal IRIs and their 
relationship with immune cell infiltration.
METHOD: A differential gene expression analysis was made based on the GSE148420 
dataset from the NCBI Gene Expression Comprehensive Database (GEO) combined with 
92 oxidative-stress (OS)-related genes identified in the Molecular Signatures 
Database. Then we identified differentially-expressed genes (DEOSGs) associated 
with oxidative stress, which were used for gene ontology (GO) and a Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. At the same time, we used 
PPI protein interaction networks and Lasso regression analysis to identify key 
genes, which were verified by the validation sets GSE58438 and GSE71647, as well 
as Western Blot detection on rat renal IRI models. At the same time, PAS 
staining, HE staining and immunohistochemistry were used to detect tissue damage 
and expression of markers related to oxidative stress during renal 
ischemia-reperfusion. Single-gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to further 
clarify the underlying biological functions of key genes. Cibersort was used to 
analyze the immune cell infiltration during renal IRI and the correlation of key 
genes with immune cells. At the same time, we constructed a network of 
transcription-factor (TF)-Hub genes and miRNA-Hub genes. DGIDB was used to 
predict drugs and molecular compounds that might interact with the Hub genes.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, a total of 5456 differential genes 
(DEGs) were measured in the renal IRI group, 2486 of which were upregulated and 
2970 were down-regulated. Among them, we found 30 DEGs (DEOSGs) associated with 
oxidative stress. The results of GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that 
these DEOSGs were mainly enriched in glutathione metabolism, the response to 
oxidative stress stimulation, the regulation of T cell activation and apoptosis 
signaling pathways. Through a protein interaction network (PPI) and a LASSO 
regression analysis, a total of two Hub genes were identified, namely GPX3 and 
GSTT1, which were validated through external validation sets and animal 
experiments. Through pathological methods, we found that the pathological damage 
of renal tissue and the expression of oxidative stress markers increased after 
renal ischemia-reperfusion. The results of GSEA showed that the Hub genes were 
related to oxidative stress pathways, apoptosis signaling pathways and 
immune-response-related signaling pathways. An immunoinfiltration correlation 
analysis showed that genes GPX3 and GSTT1 were significantly positively 
correlated with plasma cells and macrophage M0, while were negatively correlated 
with monocytes and macrophages M1 and M2. Using the Strust, Starbase and DGIDB 
database, we predicted that 81 transcription factors, 49 miRNAs and 13 drug or 
molecular compounds might interact with the Hub genes.
CONCLUSION: Through a comprehensive analysis of gene expression, our findings 
may provide new potential biomarkers for the pathogenesis of renal IRIs and a 
reliable basis for its early diagnosis as well as treatment.

Thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is an orbital autoimmune inflammatory 
disease that is commonly associated with thyroid dysfunction. Although the 
etiology of TAO is unclear, ROS accumulation and oxidative stress have been 
closely linked to the pathogenesis of TAO. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent 
programmed cell death characterized by intracellular labile iron levels, 
excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. 
Currently, there are few reports regarding the role of ferroptosis in TAO. This 
article aimed to identify ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) with diagnostic and 
therapeutic potential in TAO and explore their relationship with immune cells 
and lncRNAs. GSE58331 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database. A total of 162 DEGs were identified between 27 TAO samples and 22 
health samples from GSE58331, among which six FRGs (CYBB, CTSB, SLC38A1, TLR4, 
PEX3, and ABCC1) were obtained. The AUC of SLC38A1, TLR4, PEX3 in lacrimal gland 
tissues was greater than 80 which suggested high diagnostic value in TAO. The 
result of immune cell infiltrate analysis indicated increased infiltration of 
monocytes (p < 0.001), macrophages M0(p = 0.039), mast cells activated (p = 
0.008), and neutrophils (p = 0.045) in orbital tissues from TAO patients. 
Meanwhile, mast cells resting (p = 0.043) and macrophages M2 (p = 0.02) showed 
reduced infiltration in TAO samples. There were no gender differences in immune 
cell infiltration in the TAO patients. Two differentially expressed lncRNAs, 
LINC01140 and ZFHX4-AS1, in TAO groups were identified as ferroptosis-related 
lncRNAs. CYBB-LINC01140-TLR4, CYBB- LINC01140- SLC38A1, TLR4- LINC01140- 
SLC38A1, and CTSB- ZFHX4-AS1- CYBB may be potential RNA regulatory pathways in 
TAO. Targeted drugs and transcription factors for differential expressed FRGs 
were also screened out in our study. In vitro, experiments revealed that CTSB, 
PEX3, ABCC1 and ZFHX4-AS1(lncRNA) were differentially expressed in orbital 
fibroblasts (OFs) between TAO groups and healthy controls at the transcriptional 
level.

BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis (RIOM) and chemotherapy-induced 
oral mucositis (CIOM) are common complications in cancer patients, leading to 
negative clinical manifestations, reduced quality of life, and unsatisfactory 
treatment outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to identify potential molecular mechanisms 
and candidate drugs by data mining.
METHODS: We obtained a preliminary list of genes associated with RIOM and CIOM. 
In-depth information on these genes was explored by functional and enrichment 
analyses. Then, the drug-gene interaction database was used to determine the 
interaction of the final enriched gene list with known drugs and analyze the 
drug candidates.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This study identified 21 hub genes that may play an 
important role in RIOM and CIOM, respectively. Through our data mining, 
bioinformatics survey, and candidate drug selection, TNF, IL-6, and TLR9 could 
play an important role in disease progression and treatment. In addition, eight 
candidate drugs (olokizumab, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, adalimumab, 
etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, and thalidomide) were selected by the 
drug-gene interaction literature search additionally, as candidates for treating 
RIOM and CIOM.

Background: Along with acceleration of population aging, the increasing 
prevalence of sarcopenia has posed a heavy burden on families as well as 
society. In this context, it is of great significance to diagnose and intervene 
sarcopenia as early as possible. Recent evidence has indicated the role of 
cuproptosis in the development of sarcopenia. In this study, we aimed to seek 
the key cuproptosis-related genes that can be used for identification and 
intervention of sarcopenia. Methods: The GSE111016 dataset was retrieved from 
GEO. The 31 cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) were obtained from previous 
published studies. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and Weighed gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were subsequently analyzed. The core hub 
genes were acquired by the intersection of DEGs, WGCNA and CRGs. Through 
logistic regression analysis, we established a diagnostic model of sarcopenia 
based on the selected biomarkers and was validated in muscle samples from 
GSE111006 and GSE167186. In addition, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed on these genes. 
Furthermore, the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune cell 
infiltration were also conducted on the identified core genes. Finally, we 
screened the potential drugs targeting the potential biomarkers of sarcopenia. 
Results: A total of 902 DEGs and WGCNA containing 1,281 significant genes were 
preliminarily selected. Intersection of DEGs, WGCNA and CRGs yielded four core 
genes (PDHA1, DLAT, PDHB, and NDUFC1) as potential biomarkers for the prediction 
of sarcopenia. The predictive model was established and validated with high AUC 
values. KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology biological analysis indicated these core 
genes may play a crucial role in energy metabolism in mitochondria, oxidation 
process, and aging-related degenerative diseases. In addition, the immune cells 
may be involved in the development of sarcopenia through mitochondrial 
metabolism. Finally, metformin was identified as a promising strategy of 
sarcopenia treatment via targeting NDUFC1. Conclusion: The four 
cuproptosis-related genes PDHA1, DLAT, PDHB and NDUFC1 may be the diagnostic 
biomarkers for sarcopenia, and metformin holds great potential to be developed 
as a therapy for sarcopenia. These outcomes provide new insights for better 
understanding of sarcopenia and innovative therapeutic approaches.

Esophageal cancer is the seventh most prevalent and the sixth most lethal 
cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the major esophageal 
cancer subtypes that accounts for 87 % of the total cases. However, its 
molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we present an integrated database for 
ESCC called ESCCdb, which includes a total of 56 datasets and published studies 
from the GEO, Xena or SRA databases and related publications. It helps users to 
explore a particular gene with multiple graphical and interactive views with one 
click. The results comprise expression changes across 20 datasets, copy number 
alterations in 11 datasets, somatic mutations from 12 papers, related drugs 
derived from DGIdb, related pathways, and gene correlations. ESCCdb enables 
directly cross-dataset comparison of a gene's mutations, expressions and copy 
number changes in multiple datasets. This allows users to easily assess the 
alterations in ESCC. Furthermore, survival analysis, drug-gene relationships, 
and results from whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screening can help users determine the 
clinical relevance, derive functional inferences, and identify potential drugs. 
Notably, ESCCdb also enables the exploration of the correlation structure and 
identification of potential key regulators for a process. Finally, we identified 
789 consistently differential expressed genes; we summarized recurrently mutated 
genes and genes affected by significant copy number alterations. These genes may 
be stable biomarkers or important players during ESCC development. ESCCdb fills 
the gap between massive omics data and users' needs for integrated analysis and 
can promote basic and clinical ESCC research. The database is freely accessible 
at http://cailab.labshare.cn/ESCCdb.

OBJECTIVES: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is recognized as one of the most 
prevalent and deadliest malignancies around the globe. The molecular mechanisms 
behind LUAD have not been fully elucidated. This study was launched to explore 
LUAD-associated hub genes and their enriched pathways using bioinformatics 
methods.
METHODS: Information on GSE10072 was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database and analyzed via the Limma package-based GEO2R tool to obtain the 
top 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in LUAD. The protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was drawn using the STRING website and was 
shifted into Cytoscape to screen the top 6 hub genes via the CytoHubba 
application. Furthermore, the expression analysis and validation of hub genes in 
LUAD samples and cell lines were done using UALCAN, OncoDB, and GENT2 databases. 
Moreover, OncoDB was also used for analyzing hub gene DNA methylation levels. In 
addition, cBioPortal, GSEA tool, Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter, Enrichr, CancerSEA, 
and DGIdb were performed to explore some other important aspects of hub genes in 
LUAD.
RESULTS: We identified Interleukin 6 (IL6), Collagen, type I, alpha 1 (COL1A1), 
TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), CD34 molecule (CD34), Decorin (DCN), 
and Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) genes as the hub genes in LUAD, out of 
which IL6, CD34, and DCN were significantly down-regulated while COL1A1, TIMP1, 
and SPP1 were significantly up-regulated in LUAD cell lines and samples of 
diverse clinical variables. In this study, we also documented some important 
correlations between hub genes and other parameters such as DNA methylation, 
genetic alterations, Overall Survival (OS), and 14 important states at the 
single cell level. Lastly, we also identified hub genes associated with the 
ceRNA network and 11 important chemotherapeutic drugs.
CONCLUSION: We identified 6 hub genes involved in the development and 
progression of LUAD. These hub genes can also be helpful in the accurate 
detection of LUAD and provide novel ideas for treatment.

Conventional wet laboratory testing, validations, and synthetic procedures are 
costly and time-consuming for drug discovery. Advancements in artificial 
intelligence (AI) techniques have revolutionized their applications to drug 
discovery. Combined with accessible data resources, AI techniques are changing 
the landscape of drug discovery. In the past decades, a series of AI-based 
models have been developed for various steps of drug discovery. These models 
have been used as complements of conventional experiments and have accelerated 
the drug discovery process. In this review, we first introduced the widely used 
data resources in drug discovery, such as ChEMBL and DrugBank, followed by the 
molecular representation schemes that convert data into computer-readable 
formats. Meanwhile, we summarized the algorithms used to develop AI-based models 
for drug discovery. Subsequently, we discussed the applications of AI techniques 
in pharmaceutical analysis including predicting drug toxicity, drug bioactivity, 
and drug physicochemical property. Furthermore, we introduced the AI-based 
models for de novo drug design, drug-target structure prediction, drug-target 
interaction, and binding affinity prediction. Moreover, we also highlighted the 
advanced applications of AI in drug synergism/antagonism prediction and 
nanomedicine design. Finally, we discussed the challenges and future 
perspectives on the applications of AI to drug discovery.

Spatial heterogeneity is a common phenomenon in metastatic solid tumors and an 
evolving concept in multiple myeloma (MM). The interplay between malignant 
plasma cells (PCs) and the microenvironment has not yet been analyzed in MM. For 
this purpose, we performed bone marrow aspirates and imaging-guided biopsies of 
corresponding lesions in newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) and relapsed/refractory MM 
(RRMM) patients. PCs were isolated and subjected to whole-exome sequencing 
(WES). Non-PCs were studied with next-generation flow (NGF) and T-cell receptor 
sequencing (TCRseq) to analyze the connection between malignant and nonmalignant 
cells in the bone marrow and in lesions. Although we observed a strong overlap 
from WES, NGF, and TCRseq in patients with intramedullary disease, WES revealed 
significant spatial heterogeneity in patients with extramedullary disease. NGF 
showed significant immunosuppression in RRMM compared with NDMM as indicated by 
fewer myeloid dendritic cells, unswitched memory B cells, Th9 cells, and CD8 
effector memory T cells but more natural killer and regulatory T cells. 
Additionally, fewer T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences were detected in RRMM 
compared with NDMM and healthy individuals. After induction therapy, TCR 
repertoire richness increased to levels of healthy individuals, and NGF showed 
more regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regardless of 
depth of response. Clinical significance of imaging-guided biopsies of lesions 
was demonstrated by detection of monoclonal PCs in patients without measurable 
residual disease (MRD) in aspirates from the iliac crest as well as 
identification of secondary primary malignancies in MRD- patients. Furthermore, 
site-specific clones with different drug susceptibilities and genetically 
defined high-risk features were detected by our workflow.

BACKGROUND: To identify potential immune-related biomarkers, molecular 
mechanism, and therapeutic agents of intracranial aneurysms (IAs).
METHODS: We identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between IAs and 
control samples from GSE75436, GSE26969, GSE6551, and GSE13353 datasets. We used 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) analysis to identify immune-related hub genes. We evaluated 
the expression of hub genes by using qRT-PCR analysis. Using miRNet, 
NetworkAnalyst, and DGIdb databases, we analyzed the regulatory networks and 
potential therapeutic agents targeting hub genes. Least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was performed to identify optimal 
biomarkers among hub genes. The diagnostic value was validated by external 
GSE15629 dataset.
RESULTS: We identified 227 DEGs and 22 differentially infiltrating immune cells 
between IAs and control samples from GSE75436, GSE26969, GSE6551, and GSE13353 
datasets. We further identified 41 differentially expressed immune-related genes 
(DEIRGs), which were primarily enriched in the chemokine-mediated signaling 
pathway, myeloid leukocyte migration, endocytic vesicle membrane, chemokine 
receptor binding, chemokine activity, and viral protein interactions with 
cytokines and their receptors. Among 41 DEIRGs, 10 hub genes including C3AR1, 
CD163, CCL4, CXCL8, CCL3, TLR2, TYROBP, C1QB, FCGR3A, and FCGR1A were identified 
with good diagnostic values (AUC >0.7). Hsa-mir-27a-3p and transcription 
factors, including YY1 and GATA2, were identified the primary regulators of hub 
genes. 92 potential therapeutic agents targeting hub genes were predicted. C3AR1 
and CD163 were finally identified as the best diagnostic biomarkers using LASSO 
logistic regression (AUC = 0.994). The diagnostic value of C3AR1 and CD163 was 
validated by the external GSE15629 dataset (AUC = 0.914).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the importance of C3AR1 and CD163 in immune 
infiltration in IAs pathogenesis. Our finding provided a valuable reference for 
subsequent research on the potential targets for molecular mechanisms and 
intervention of IAs.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to reveal the biological function of 
endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related genes (ERSGs) in periodontitis, and 
provide potential ERS diagnostic markers for clinical therapy of periodontitis.
METHODS: The differentially expressed ERSGs (DE-ERSGs) were reveled based on 
periodontitis-related microarray dataset in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database and 295 ERS in previous study, followed by a protein-protein 
interaction network construction. Then, the subtypes of periodontitis were 
explored, followed by validation with immune cell infiltration and gene set 
enrichment. Two machine learning algorithms were used to reveal potential ERS 
diagnostic markers of periodontitis. The diagnostic effect, target drug and 
immune correlation of these markers were further evaluated. Finally, a 
microRNA(miRNA)-gene interaction network was constructed.
RESULTS: A total of 34 DE-ERSGs were revealed between periodontitis samples and 
control, followed by two subtypes investigated. There was a significant 
difference of ERS score, immune infiltration and Hallmark enrichment between two 
subtypes. Then, totally 7 ERS diagnostic markers including FCGR2B, XBP1, EDEM2, 
ATP2A3, ERLEC1, HYOU1 and YOD1 were explored, and the v the time-dependent ROC 
analysis showed a reliable result. In addition, a drug-gene network was 
constructed with 4 up-regulated ERS diagnostic markers and 24 drugs. Finally, 
based on 32 interactions, 5 diagnostic markers and 20 miRNAs, a miRNA-target 
network was constructed.
CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulated miR-671-5p might take part in the progression of 
periodontitis via stimulating the expression of ATP2A3. ERSGs including XBP1 and 
FCGR2B might be novel diagnostic marker for periodontitis.

AIM: This study aimed to identify autophagy-related genes (ARGs) associated with 
non-obstructive azoospermia and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Two datasets associated with azoospermia were downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus database, and ARGs were obtained from the Human 
Autophagy-dedicated Database. Autophagy-related differentially expressed genes 
were identified in the azoospermia and control groups. These genes were 
subjected to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and functional similarity analyses. 
After identifying the hub genes, immune infiltration and hub gene-RNA-binding 
protein (RBP)-transcription factor (TF)-miRNA-drug interactions were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total 46 differentially expressed ARGs were identified between the 
azoospermia and control groups. These genes were enriched in 
autophagy-associated functions and pathways. Eight hub genes were selected from 
the PPI network. Functional similarity analysis revealed that HSPA5 may play a 
key role in azoospermia. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that 
activated dendritic cells were significantly decreased in the azoospermia group 
compared to those in the control groups. Hub genes, especially ATG3, KIAA0652, 
MAPK1, and EGFR were strongly correlated with immune cell infiltration. Finally, 
a hub gene-miRNA-TF-RBP-drug network was constructed.
CONCLUSION: The eight hub genes, including EGFR, HSPA5, ATG3, KIAA0652, and 
MAPK1, may serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of azoospermia. 
The study findings suggest potential targets and mechanisms for the occurrence 
and development of this disease.

Background: Suicidal behaviour (SB) refers to behaviours, ranging from non-fatal 
suicidal behaviour, such as suicidal ideation and attempt, to completed suicide. 
Despite recent advancements in genomic technology and statistical methods, it is 
unclear to what extent the spectrum of suicidal behaviour is explained by shared 
genetic aetiology. Methods: We identified nine genome-wide association 
statistics of suicidal behaviour (sample sizes, n, ranging from 62,648 to 
125,844), ten psychiatric traits [n up to 386,533] and collectively, nine 
summary datasets of anthropometric, behavioural and socioeconomic-related traits 
[n ranging from 58,610 to 941,280]. We calculated the genetic correlation among 
these traits and modelled this using genomic structural equation modelling, 
identified shared biological processes and pathways between suicidal behaviour 
and psychiatric disorders and evaluated potential causal associations using 
Mendelian randomisation. Results: Among populations of European ancestry, we 
observed strong positive genetic correlations between suicide ideation, attempt 
and self-harm (rg range, 0.71-1.09) and moderate to strong genetic correlations 
between suicidal behaviour traits and a range of psychiatric disorders, most 
notably, major depression disorder (rg = 0.86, p = 1.62 × 10-36). Multivariate 
analysis revealed a common factor structure for suicidal behaviour traits, major 
depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and alcohol use 
disorder. The derived common factor explained 38.7% of the shared variance 
across the traits. We identified 2,951 genes and 98 sub-network hub genes 
associated with the common factor, including pathways associated with 
developmental biology, signal transduction and RNA degradation. We found 
suggestive evidence for the protective effects of higher household income level 
on suicide attempt [OR = 0.55 (0.44-0.70), p = 1.29 × 10-5] and while further 
investigation is needed, a nominal significant effect of smoking on suicide 
attempt [OR = 1.24 (1.04-1.44), p = 0.026]. Conclusion: Our findings provide 
evidence of shared aetiology between suicidal behaviour and psychiatric 
disorders and indicate potential common molecular mechanisms contributing to the 
overlapping pathophysiology. These findings provide a better understanding of 
the complex genetic architecture of suicidal behaviour and have implications for 
the prevention and treatment of suicidal behaviour.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the lethal malignancies, with 
limited biomarkers identified to predict its prognosis and treatment response of 
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). This study aimed to explore the predictive 
ability of T cell marker genes score (TMGS) to predict their overall survival 
(OS) and treatment response to ICB by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data. Multi-omics data of PDAC were applied in this 
study. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was utilized for 
dimensionality reduction and cluster identification. The non-negative matrix 
factorization (NMF) algorithm was applied to molecular subtypes clustering. The 
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-Cox regression was 
adopted for TMGS construction. The prognosis, biological characteristics, 
mutation profile, and immune function status between different groups were 
compared. Two molecular subtypes were identified via NMF: proliferative PDAC 
(C1) and immune PDAC (C2). Distinct prognoses and biological characteristics 
were observed between them. TMGS was developed based on 10 T cell marker genes 
(TMGs) through LASSO-Cox regression. TMGS is an independent prognostic factor of 
OS in PDAC. Enrichment analysis indicated that cell cycle and cell 
proliferation-related pathways are significantly enriched in the high-TMGS 
group. Besides, high-TMGS is related to more frequent KRAS, TP53, and CDKN2A 
germline mutations than the low-TMGS group. Furthermore, high-TMGS is 
significantly associated with attenuated antitumor immunity and reduced immune 
cell infiltration compared to the low-TMGS group. However, high TMGS is 
correlated to higher tumor mutation burden (TMB), a low expression level of 
inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules, and a low immune dysfunction score, thus 
having a higher ICB response rate. On the contrary, low TMGS is related to a 
favorable response rate to chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapy. By 
combining scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data, we identified a novel biomarker, 
TMGS, which has remarkable performance in predicting the prognosis and guiding 
the treatment pattern for patients with PDAC.

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness, and primary 
open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type. Due to inadequate diagnosis, 
treatment is often not administered until symptoms occur. Hence, approaches 
enabling earlier prediction or diagnosis of POAG are necessary. We aimed to 
identify novel drugs for glaucoma through bioinformatics and network analysis. 
Data from 36 samples, obtained from the trabecular meshwork of healthy 
individuals and patients with POAG, were acquired from a dataset. Next, 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified to construct a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. In both stages, the genes were 
enriched by studying the critical biological processes and pathways related to 
POAG. Finally, a drug-gene network was constructed, and novel drugs for POAG 
treatment were proposed. Genes with p < 0.01 and |log fold change| > 0.3 (1,350 
genes) were considered DEGs and utilized to construct a PPI network. Enrichment 
analysis yielded several key pathways that were upregulated or downregulated. 
For example, extracellular matrix organization, the immune system, neutrophil 
degranulation, and cytokine signaling were upregulated among immune pathways, 
while signal transduction, the immune system, extracellular matrix organization, 
and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling were downregulated. Finally, novel drugs 
including metformin hydrochloride, ixazomib citrate, and cisplatin warrant 
further analysis of their potential roles in POAG treatment. The candidate drugs 
identified in this computational analysis require in vitro and in vivo 
validation to confirm their effectiveness in POAG treatment. This may pave the 
way for understanding life-threatening disorders such as cancer.

Background: Rosacea is a common facial skin inflammatory disease featured by 
hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in the epidermis. Due to unclear 
pathogenesis, the effective treatment options for rosacea remain limited. 
Methods: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analyzed the 
relationship between epidermis autophagy and mTOR pathways in rosacea, and 
further demonstrated it through immunofluorescence and qPCR analysis. A 
potential therapeutic agent for rosacea was predicted based on the key genes of 
the WGCNA module. In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to verify its 
therapeutic role. Drug-target prediction (TargetNet, Swiss, and Tcmsp) and 
molecular docking offered potential pharmacological targets. Results: WGCNA 
showed that epidermis autophagy was related to the activation of mTOR pathways 
in rosacea. Next, autophagy was downregulated in the epidermis of rosacea, which 
was regulated by mTOR. In addition, the in vivo experiment demonstrated that 
autophagy induction could be an effective treatment strategy for rosacea. 
Subsequently, based on the key genes of the WGCNA module, 
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was predicted as a potential therapeutic agent 
for rosacea. Furthermore, the therapeutic role of EGCG on rosacea was confirmed 
in vivo and in vitro. Finally, drug-target prediction and molecular docking 
revealed that AKT1/MAPK1/MMP9 could be the pharmacological targets of EGCG in 
rosacea. Conclusion: Collectively, our findings revealed the vital role of 
autophagy in rosacea and identified that EGCG, as a therapeutic agent for 
rosacea, attenuated rosacea-like inflammation via inducing autophagy in 
keratinocytes.

Recent studies have demonstrated the close relationship between parathyroid 
adenoma (PA) and thyroid follicular adenoma (FTA). However, the underlying 
pathogenesis remains unknown. This study focused on exploring common pathogenic 
genes, as well as the pathogenesis of these two diseases, through bioinformatics 
methods. This work obtained PA and FTA datasets from the Integrated Gene 
Expression Database to identify the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
of two diseases. The functions of the genes were investigated by GO and KEGG 
enrichment. The program CytoHubba was used to select the hub genes, while 
receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted to evaluate the predictive 
significance of the hub genes. The DGIbd database was used to identify 
gene-targeted drugs. This work detected a total of 77 DEGs. Enrichment analysis 
demonstrated that DEGs had activities of 3',5'-cyclic AMP, and nucleotide 
phosphodiesterases and were associated with cell proliferation. NOS1, VWF, 
TGFBR2, CAV1, and MAPK1 were identified as hub genes after verification. The 
area under the curve of PA and FTA was>0.7, and the hub genes participated in 
the Relaxin Signaling Pathway, focal adhesion, and other pathways. The 
construction of the mRNA-miRNA interaction network yielded 11 important miRNAs, 
while gene-targeting drug prediction identified four targeted drugs with 
possible effects. This bioinformatics study demonstrated that cell proliferation 
and tumor suppression and the hub genes co-occurring in PA and FTA, have 
important effects on the occurrence and progression of two diseases, which make 
them potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

Both obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can lead to metabolic 
dysregulation and systemic inflammation. Similar to obesity, increasing evidence 
has revealed that immune infiltration in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is 
associated with obstructive sleep apnea-related morbidity. However, the 
pathological changes and potential molecular mechanisms in visceral adipose 
tissue of obstructive sleep apnea patients need to be further studied. Herein, 
by bioinformatics analysis and clinical validation methods, including the 
immune-related differentially expressed genes (IRDEGs) analysis, protein-protein 
interaction network (PPI), functional enrichment analysis, a devolution 
algorithm (CIBERSORT), spearman's correlation analysis, polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC), we identified and validated 10 hub IRDEGs, the 
relative mRNA expression of four hub genes (CRP, CD40LG, CCL20, and GZMB), and 
the protein expression level of two hub genes (CD40LG and GZMB) were consistent 
with the bioinformatics analysis results. Immune infiltration results further 
revealed that obstructive sleep apnea patients contained a higher proportion of 
pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and a lower proportion of M2 macrophages. 
Spearman's correlation analysis showed that CD40LG was positively correlated 
with M1 macrophages and GZMB was negatively correlated with M2 macrophages. 
CD40LG and GZMB might play a vital role in the visceral adipose tissue 
homeostasis of obstructive sleep apnea patients. Their interaction with 
macrophages and involved pathways not only provides new insights for 
understanding molecular mechanisms but also be of great significance in 
discovering novel small molecules or other promising candidates as 
immunotherapies of OSA-associated metabolic complications.

BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor. The 
existing treatment regimens remained essentially unchanged over the past 30 
years; hence the prognosis has plateaued at a poor level. Precise and 
personalized therapy is yet to be exploited.
METHODS: One discovery cohort (n=98) and two validation cohorts (n=53 & n=48) 
were collected from public data sources. We performed a non-negative matrix 
factorization (NMF) method on the discovery cohort to stratify osteosarcoma. 
Survival analysis and transcriptomic profiling characterized each subtype. Then, 
a drug target was screened based on subtypes' features and hazard ratios. We 
also used specific siRNAs and added a cholesterol pathway inhibitor to 
osteosarcoma cell lines (U2OS and Saos-2) to verify the target. Moreover, 
PermFIT and ProMS, two support vector machine (SVM) tools, and the least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, were employed to 
establish predictive models.
RESULTS: We herein divided osteosarcoma patients into four subtypes (S-I ~ 
S-IV). Patients of S- I were found probable to live longer. S-II was 
characterized by the highest immune infiltration. Cancer cells proliferated most 
in S-III. Notably, S-IV held the most unfavorable outcome and active cholesterol 
metabolism. SQLE, a rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, was 
identified as a potential drug target for S-IV patients. This finding was 
further validated in two external independent osteosarcoma cohorts. The function 
of SQLE to promote proliferation and migration was confirmed by cell phenotypic 
assays after the specific gene knockdown or addition of terbinafine, an 
inhibitor of SQLE. We further employed two machine learning tools based on SVM 
algorithms to develop a subtype diagnostic model and used the LASSO method to 
establish a 4-gene model for predicting prognosis. These two models were also 
verified in a validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: The molecular classification enhanced our understanding of 
osteosarcoma; the novel predicting models served as robust prognostic 
biomarkers; the therapeutic target SQLE opened a new way for treatment. Our 
results served as valuable hints for future biological studies and clinical 
trials of osteosarcoma.

Interferons play a major role in microglial-mediated neuroinflammation in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the interferon transcriptome (AD 
versus non-AD) using N9 and murine microglia. We identified 64 
interferon-related differentially expressed genes (DEG) in LPS-stimulated N9 
microglia versus control cells, 26 DEG in microglia from 5XFAD versus wild-type 
mice, with 13 DEG common to both datasets. Network analyses identified potential 
key mediators (Cxcl10, Ifit3) of the interferon response in AD. Gene-drug 
interaction analysis identified therapeutics targeting interferon-related genes. 
These data characterize the microglial interferon response in AD, providing new 
targets and therapeutics directed towards interferon-related neuroinflammation 
in AD.

Pharmacogenetics, the study of how interindividual genetic differences affect 
drug response, does not explain all observed heritable variance in drug 
response. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, and histone 
acetylation may account for some of the unexplained variances. Epigenetic 
mechanisms modulate gene expression and can be suitable drug targets and can 
impact the action of nonepigenetic drugs. Pharmacoepigenetics is the field that 
studies the relationship between epigenetic variability and drug response. Much 
of this research focuses on compounds targeting epigenetic mechanisms, called 
epigenetic drugs, which are used to treat cancers, immune disorders, and other 
diseases. Several studies also suggest an epigenetic role in classical drug 
response; however, we know little about this area. The amount of information 
correlating epigenetic biomarkers to molecular datasets has recently expanded 
due to technological advances, and novel computational approaches have emerged 
to better identify and predict epigenetic interactions. We propose that the 
relationship between epigenetics and classical drug response may be examined 
using data already available by (1) finding regions of epigenetic variance, (2) 
pinpointing key epigenetic biomarkers within these regions, and (3) mapping 
these biomarkers to a drug-response phenotype. This approach expands on existing 
knowledge to generate putative pharmacoepigenetic relationships, which can be 
tested experimentally. Epigenetic modifications are involved in disease and drug 
response. Therefore, understanding how epigenetic drivers impact the response to 
classical drugs is important for improving drug design and administration to 
better treat disease.

Introduction: More than 50 mutations in the MAPT gene result in heterogeneous 
forms of frontotemporal lobar dementia with tau inclusions (FTLD-Tau). However, 
early pathogenic events that lead to disease and the degree to which they are 
common across MAPT mutations remain poorly understood. The goal of this study is 
to determine whether there is a common molecular signature of FTLD-Tau. Methods: 
We analyzed genes differentially expressed in induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived neurons (iPSC-neurons) that represent the three major categories of 
MAPT mutations: splicing (IVS10 + 16), exon 10 (p.P301L), and C-terminal 
(p.R406W) compared with isogenic controls. The genes that were commonly 
differentially expressed in MAPT IVS10 + 16, p.P301L, and p.R406W neurons were 
enriched in trans-synaptic signaling, neuronal processes, and lysosomal 
function. Many of these pathways are sensitive to disruptions in calcium 
homeostasis. One gene, CALB1, was significantly reduced across the three MAPT 
mutant iPSC-neurons and in a mouse model of tau accumulation. We observed a 
significant reduction in calcium levels in MAPT mutant neurons compared with 
isogenic controls, pointing to a functional consequence of this disrupted gene 
expression. Finally, a subset of genes commonly differentially expressed across 
MAPT mutations were also dysregulated in brains from MAPT mutation carriers and 
to a lesser extent in brains from sporadic Alzheimer disease and progressive 
supranuclear palsy, suggesting that molecular signatures relevant to genetic and 
sporadic forms of tauopathy are captured in a dish. The results from this study 
demonstrate that iPSC-neurons capture molecular processes that occur in human 
brains and can be used to pinpoint common molecular pathways involving synaptic 
and lysosomal function and neuronal development, which may be regulated by 
disruptions in calcium homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: The circular RNA (circRNA) plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of 
tumors as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Given the high aggressiveness 
and fatality rate of glioblastoma (GBM) as well as poor prognosis, it is 
necessary to construct a circRNA-related ceRNA network for further studies on 
the mechanism of GBM and identify possible biomarkers as well as therapeutic 
drugs.
METHODS: Three datasets from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database were 
downloaded to distinguish differential circRNAs, microRNAs, and messenger RNAs 
respectively in GBM. With the help of GEPIA2, circBank, CSCD, TargetScan, miRDB, 
and miRTarBase databases, we established a circRNAs-related ceRNA network in 
GBM. Functional enrichments were employed to profile the most relevant mRNAs to 
indirectly clarify the mechanisms of the ceRNA network. Based on the expression 
profile data and survival information of GBM patients from the GEO and the 
cancer genome atlas (TCGA) databases, we performed survival analysis to select 
prognostic mRNAs and constructed a novel circRNA-miRNA-mRNA central regulatory 
subnetwork. The DGIdb database was used to find potential drug-gene 
interactions.
RESULTS: The datasets obtained from the GEO and TCGA databases were analyzed, 
and 504 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), 71 differentially expressed 
microRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and 270 differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) 
were screened out. The novel ceRNA regulatory network included 22 circRNAs, 11 
miRNAs, and 15 mRNAs. FZD1 and KLF10 were significantly correlated with the 
overall survival rate of patients with GBM (P < 0.05). The final survival 
subnetwork contained six circRNAs, two miRNAs, and two mRNAs. Two small-molecule 
compounds and one antibody could be used as therapeutic drugs for GBM. 
Interestingly, the Wnt signaling pathway appeared in both KEGG and GO functional 
terms.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study demonstrate that FZD1 and KLF10 may exert 
regulatory functions in GBM, and the ceRNA-mediated network could be a 
therapeutic strategy for GBM.

Circadian and circannual cycles trigger physiological changes whose reflection 
on human transcriptomes remains largely uncharted. We used the time and season 
of death of 932 individuals from GTEx to jointly investigate transcriptomic 
changes associated with those cycles across multiple tissues. Overall, most 
variation across tissues during day-night and among seasons was unique to each 
cycle. Although all tissues remodeled their transcriptomes, brain and gonadal 
tissues exhibited the highest seasonality, whereas those in the thoracic cavity 
showed stronger day-night regulation. Core clock genes displayed marked 
day-night differences across multiple tissues, which were largely conserved in 
baboon and mouse, but adapted to their nocturnal or diurnal habits. Seasonal 
variation of expression affected multiple pathways, and it was enriched among 
genes associated with the immune response, consistent with the seasonality of 
viral infections. Furthermore, they unveiled cytoarchitectural changes in brain 
regions. Altogether, our results provide the first combined atlas of how 
transcriptomes from human tissues adapt to major cycling environmental 
conditions. This atlas may have multiple applications; for example, drug targets 
with day-night or seasonal variation in gene expression may benefit from 
temporally adjusted doses.

We have developed the underrepresented post-translational modification (PTM) 
database (urPTMdb), a PTM gene set database to accelerate the discovery of 
enriched protein modifications in experimental data. urPTMdb provides curated 
lists of proteins reported to be substrates of underrepresented modifications. 
Their enrichment in proteomics datasets can reveal unexpected PTM regulations. 
urPTMdb can be implemented in existing workflows, or used in TeaProt, an online 
Shiny tool that integrates upstream transcription factor enrichment analysis 
with downstream pathway analysis through an easy-to-use interactive interface. 
TeaProt annotates user-uploaded data with drug-gene interactions, subcellular 
localizations, phenotypic functions, gene-disease associations, and enzyme-gene 
interactions. TeaProt enables gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to discover 
enrichments in gene sets from various resources, including MSigDB, CHEA, and 
urPTMdb. We demonstrate the utility of urPTMdb and TeaProt through the analysis 
of a previously published Western diet-induced remodeling of the tongue 
proteome, which revealed altered cellular processes associated with energy 
metabolism, interferon alpha/gamma response, adipogenesis, HMGylation substrate 
enrichment, and transcription regulation through PPARG and CEBPA. Additionally, 
we analyzed the interactome of ADP-ribose glycohydrolase TARG1, a key enzyme 
that removes mono-ADP-ribosylation. This analysis identified an enrichment of 
ADP-ribosylation, ribosomal proteins, and proteins localized in the nucleoli and 
endoplasmic reticulum. TeaProt and urPTMdb are accessible at 
https://tea.coffeeprot.com/.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an organ dysfunction syndrome caused by the body's 
dysregulated response to infection. Yet, due to the heterogeneity of this 
disease process, the diagnosis and definition of sepsis is a critical issue in 
clinical work. Existing methods for early diagnosis of sepsis have low 
specificity.
AIMS: This study evaluated the diagnostic and predictive values of 
pyroptosis-related genes in normal and sepsis patients and their role in the 
immune microenvironment using multiple bioinformatics analyses and 
machine-learning methods.
METHODS: Pediatric sepsis microarray datasets were screened from the GEO 
database and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 
pyroptosis were analyzed. DEGs were then subjected to multiple bioinformatics 
analyses. The differential immune landscape between sepsis and healthy controls 
was explored by screening diagnostic genes using various machine-learning 
models. Also, the diagnostic value of these diagnosis-related genes in sepsis 
(miRNAs that have regulatory relationships with genes and related drugs that 
have regulatory relationships) were analyzed in the internal test set and 
external test.
RESULTS: Eight genes (CLEC5A, MALT1, NAIP, NLRC4, SERPINB1, SIRT1, STAT3, and 
TLR2) related to sepsis diagnosis were screened by multiple machine learning 
algorithms. The CIBERSORT algorithm confirmed that these genes were 
significantly correlated with the infiltration abundance of some immune cells 
and immune checkpoint sites (all P<0.05). SIRT1, STAT3, and TLR2 were identified 
by the DGIdb database as potentially regulated by multiple drugs. Finally, 7 
genes were verified to have significantly different expressions between the 
sepsis group and the control group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The pyroptosis-related genes identified and verified in this study 
may provide a useful reference for the prediction and assessment of sepsis.

The proteins and RNAs of viruses extensively interact with host proteins after 
infection. We collected and reanalyzed all available datasets of protein-protein 
and RNA-protein interactions related to SARS-CoV-2. We investigated the 
reproducibility of those interactions and made strict filters to identify highly 
confident interactions. We systematically analyzed the interaction network and 
identified preferred subcellular localizations of viral proteins, some of which 
such as ORF8 in ER and ORF7A/B in ER membrane were validated using dual 
fluorescence imaging. Moreover, we showed that viral proteins frequently 
interact with host machinery related to protein processing in ER and 
vesicle-associated processes. Integrating the protein- and RNA-interactomes, we 
found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA and its N protein closely interacted with stress 
granules including 40 core factors, of which we specifically validated G3BP1, 
IGF2BP1, and MOV10 using RIP and Co-IP assays. Combining CRISPR screening 
results, we further identified 86 antiviral and 62 proviral factors and 
associated drugs. Using network diffusion, we found additional 44 interacting 
proteins including two proviral factors previously validated. Furthermore, we 
showed that this atlas could be applied to identify the complications associated 
with COVID-19. All data are available in the AIMaP database 
(https://mvip.whu.edu.cn/aimap/) for users to easily explore the interaction 
map.

OBJECTIVE: To infer potential mechanisms driving disease subtypes among patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we profiled the transcriptome of purified 
circulating monocytes and CD4 T-cells.
DESIGN: RNA extracted from purified monocytes and CD4 T-cells derived from the 
peripheral blood of 125 endoscopically active patients with IBD was sequenced 
using Illumina HiSeq 4000NGS. We used complementary supervised and unsupervised 
analytical methods to infer gene expression signatures associated with 
demographic/clinical features. Expression differences and specificity were 
validated by comparison with publicly available single cell datasets, 
tissue-specific expression and meta-analyses. Drug target information, 
druggability and adverse reaction records were used to prioritise disease 
subtype-specific therapeutic targets.
RESULTS: Unsupervised/supervised methods identified significant differences in 
the expression profiles of CD4 T-cells between patients with ileal Crohn's 
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Following a pathway-based 
classification (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic - AUROC=86%) 
between ileal-CD and UC patients, we identified MAPK and FOXO pathways to be 
downregulated in UC. Coexpression module/regulatory network analysis using 
systems-biology approaches revealed mediatory core transcription factors. We 
independently confirmed that a subset of the disease location-associated 
signature is characterised by T-cell-specific and location-specific expression. 
Integration of drug-target information resulted in the discovery of several new 
(BCL6, GPR183, TNFAIP3) and repurposable drug targets (TUBB2A, PRKCQ) for ileal 
CD as well as novel targets (NAPEPLD, SLC35A1) for UC.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic profiling of circulating CD4 T-cells in patients 
with IBD demonstrated marked molecular differences between the IBD-spectrum 
extremities (UC and predominantly ileal CD, sandwiching colonic CD), which could 
help in prioritising particular drug targets for IBD subtypes.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are causally related, yet there is considerable 
heterogeneity in the consequences of both conditions and the mechanisms of 
action are poorly defined. Here we show a genetic-driven approach defining two 
obesity profiles that convey highly concordant and discordant diabetogenic 
effects. We annotate and then compare association signals for these profiles 
across clinical and molecular phenotypic layers. Key differences are identified 
in a wide range of traits, including cardiovascular mortality, fat distribution, 
liver metabolism, blood pressure, specific lipid fractions and blood levels of 
proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodelling. We find marginal 
differences in abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes bacteria in the gut. 
Instrumental analyses reveal prominent causal roles for waist-to-hip ratio, 
blood pressure and cholesterol content of high-density lipoprotein particles in 
the development of diabetes in obesity. We prioritize 17 genes from the 
discordant signature that convey protection against type 2 diabetes in obesity, 
which may represent logical targets for precision medicine approaches.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of themost common causes of major birth 
defects, with a prevalence of 1%. Although an increasing number of studies have 
reported the etiology of CHD, the findings scattered throughout the literature 
are difficult to retrieve and utilize in research and clinical practice. We 
therefore developed CHDbase, an evidence-based knowledgebase of CHD-related 
genes and clinical manifestations manually curated from 1114 publications, 
linking 1124susceptibility genes and 3591 variations to more than 300 CHD types 
and related syndromes. Metadata such as the information of each publication and 
the selected population and samples, the strategy of studies, and the major 
findings of studies were integrated with each item of the research record. We 
also integrated functional annotations through parsing ∼ 50 databases/tools to 
facilitate the interpretation of these genes and variations in disease 
pathogenicity. We further prioritized the significance of these CHD-related 
genes with a gene interaction network approach and extracted a core CHD 
sub-network with 163 genes. The clear genetic landscape of CHD enables the 
phenotype classification based on the shared genetic origin. Overall, CHDbase 
provides a comprehensive and freely available resource to study CHD 
susceptibilities, supporting a wide range of users in the scientific and medical 
communities. CHDbase is accessible at http://chddb.fwgenetics.org.

Hypertension (HTN) is associated with gut dysbiosis and the depletion of 
butyrate-producing bacteria in animal models and people. Furthermore, fecal 
material transfer from donor hypertensive patients increases blood pressure in 
normotensive recipient animals and ameliorates HTN-associated pathophysiology. 
These observations have implications in the impaired interactions between the 
gut and gut microbiota in HTN. Although this concept is supported in animal 
models, little is known about human HTN. Therefore, our objective for this study 
was to compare gene expression with transcriptomics and its potential to 
influence microbiota in subjects with normal and high blood pressure (HBP). 
Colon samples from reference subjects with normal blood pressure (REF) and HBP 
were used for RNA-seq to analyze their transcriptomes. We observed the 
significant downregulation of gene sets governing immune responses (e.g., SGK1 
and OASL), gut epithelial function (e.g., KRT20 and SLC9A3R1), gut microbiota 
(e.g., PPARG and CIDEC) and genes associated with cardiovascular and gut 
diseases (e.g., PLAUR and NLN) in HBP subjects; the expression of genes within 
these pathways correlated with blood pressure. Potential drug targets in the gut 
epithelium were identified using the Drug Gene International Database for 
possible use in HTN. They include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
gamma (PPRG), active serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) and 3 
beta-hydroxysteroid isomerase type II inhibitor (HSD3B). Finally, butyrate, a 
microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acid, restored the disrupted expression of 
certain functional genes in colonic organoids from HBP subjects. Patients with 
HBP exhibit a unique transcriptome that could underlie impaired gut-microbiota 
interactions. Targeting these interactions could provide a promising new 
therapeutic intervention for hypertension management.

The exploration of biologically relevant chemical space for the discovery of 
small bioactive molecules present in marine organisms has led not only to 
important advances in certain therapeutic areas, but also to a better 
understanding of many life processes. The still largely untapped reservoir of 
countless metabolites that play biological roles in marine invertebrates and 
microorganisms opens new avenues and poses new challenges for research. 
Computational technologies provide the means to (i) organize chemical and 
biological information in easily searchable and hyperlinked databases and 
knowledgebases; (ii) carry out cheminformatic analyses on natural products; 
(iii) mine microbial genomes for known and cryptic biosynthetic pathways; (iv) 
explore global networks that connect active compounds to their targets (often 
including enzymes); (v) solve structures of ligands, targets, and their 
respective complexes using X-ray crystallography and NMR techniques, thus 
enabling virtual screening and structure-based drug design; and (vi) build 
molecular models to simulate ligand binding and understand mechanisms of action 
in atomic detail. Marine natural products are viewed today not only as potential 
drugs, but also as an invaluable source of chemical inspiration for the 
development of novel chemotypes to be used in chemical biology and medicinal 
chemistry research.

Measurement of circulating immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration is helpful for 
diagnosing and treating asthma and allergic diseases. Identifying gene 
expression signatures associated with IgE might elucidate novel pathways for IgE 
regulation. To this end, we performed a discovery transcriptome-wide association 
study to identify differentially expressed genes associated with circulating IgE 
levels in whole-blood derived RNA from 5,345 participants in the Framingham 
Heart Study across 17,873 mRNA gene-level transcripts. We identified 216 
significant transcripts at a false discovery rate <0.05. We conducted 
replication using the meta-analysis of two independent external studies: the 
Childhood Asthma Management Program (n=610) and the Genetic Epidemiology of 
Asthma in Costa Rica Study (n=326); we then reversed the discovery and 
replication cohorts, which revealed 59 significant genes that replicated in both 
directions. Gene ontology analysis revealed that many of these genes were 
implicated in immune function pathways, including defense response, inflammatory 
response, and cytokine production. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis 
revealed four genes (CLC, CCDC21, S100A13, and GCNT1) as putatively causal 
(p<0.05) regulators of IgE levels. GCNT1 (beta=1.5, p=0.01)-which is a top 
result in the MR analysis of expression in relation to asthma and allergic 
diseases-plays a role in regulating T helper type 1 cell homing, lymphocyte 
trafficking, and B cell differentiation. Our findings build upon prior knowledge 
of IgE regulation and provide a deeper understanding of underlying molecular 
mechanisms. The IgE-associated genes that we identified-particularly those 
implicated in MR analysis-can be explored as promising therapeutic targets for 
asthma and IgE-related diseases.

Outcomes for most patients with Ewing sarcoma (ES) have remained unchanged for 
the last 30 years, emphasising the need for more effective and tolerable 
treatments. We have hypothesised that using small-molecule inhibitors to kill 
the self-renewing chemotherapy-resistant cells (Ewing sarcoma cancer stem-like 
cells; ES-CSCs) responsible for progression and relapse could improve outcomes 
and minimise treatment-induced morbidities. For the first time, we demonstrate 
that ABCG1, a potential oncogene in some cancers, is highly expressed in ES-CSCs 
independently of CD133. Using functional models, transcriptomics and a bespoke 
in silico drug-repurposing pipeline, we have prioritised a group of tractable 
small-molecule inhibitors for further preclinical studies. Consistent with the 
cellular origin of ES, 21 candidate molecular targets of pluripotency, stemness 
and chemoresistance were identified. Small-molecule inhibitors to 13 of the 21 
molecular targets (62%) were identified. POU5F1/OCT4 was the most promising new 
therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma, interacting with 10 of the 21 prioritised 
molecular targets and meriting further study. The majority of small-molecule 
inhibitors (72%) target one of two drug efflux proteins, p-glycoprotein (n = 
168) or MRP1 (n = 13). In summary, we have identified a novel cell surface 
marker of ES-CSCs and cancer/non-cancer drugs to targets expressed by these 
cells that are worthy of further preclinical evaluation. If effective in 
preclinical models, these drugs and drug combinations might be repurposed for 
clinical evaluation in patients with ES.

INTRODUCTION: DNA methylation (DNAm), an epigenetic mechanism, has been 
associated with opioid use disorder (OUD) in preclinical and human studies. 
However, most of the studies have focused on DNAm at CpG sites. DNAm at non-CpG 
sites (mCpHs, where H indicates A, T, or C) has been recently shown to have a 
role in gene regulation and to be highly abundant in neurons. However, its role 
in OUD is unknown. This work aims to evaluate mCpHs in the human postmortem 
orbital frontal cortex (OFC) in the context of OUD.
METHODS: A total of 38 Postmortem OFC samples were obtained from the VA Brain 
Bank (OUD = 12; Control = 26). mCpHs were assessed using reduced representation 
oxidative bisulfite sequencing in neuronal nuclei. Differential analysis was 
performed using the "methylkit" R package. Age, ancestry, postmortem interval, 
PTSD, and smoking status were included as covariates. Significant mCpHs were set 
at q-value < 0.05. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were 
performed for the annotated genes of all differential mCpH loci using String, 
ShinyGO, and amiGO software. Further, all annotated genes were analyzed using 
the Drug gene interaction database (DGIdb).
RESULTS: A total of 2,352 differentially methylated genome-wide significant 
mCpHs were identified in OUD, mapping to 2,081 genes. GO analysis of genes with 
differential mCpH loci showed enrichment for nervous system development (p-value 
= 2.32E-19). KEGG enrichment analysis identified axon guidance and glutamatergic 
synapse (FDR 9E-4-2.1E-2). Drug interaction analysis found 3,420 interactions 
between the annotated genes and drugs, identifying interactions with 15 
opioid-related drugs, including lofexidine and tizanidine, both previously used 
for the treatment of OUD-related symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a role of mCpHs for OUD in cortical neurons and 
reveal important biological pathways and drug targets associated with the 
disorder.

Screening for pathogenic variants in the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases can 
now be performed on all genes thanks to the application of whole exome and 
genome sequencing (WES, WGS). Yet the repertoire of gene-disease associations is 
not complete. Several computer-based algorithms and databases integrate distinct 
gene-gene functional networks to accelerate the discovery of gene-disease 
associations. We hypothesize that the ability of every type of information to 
extract relevant insights is disease-dependent. We compiled 33 functional 
networks classified into 13 knowledge categories (KCs) and observed large 
variability in their ability to recover genes associated with 91 genetic 
diseases, as measured using efficiency and exclusivity. We developed GLOWgenes, 
a network-based algorithm that applies random walk with restart to evaluate KCs' 
ability to recover genes from a given list associated with a phenotype and 
modulates the prediction of new candidates accordingly. Comparison with other 
integration strategies and tools shows that our disease-aware approach can boost 
the discovery of new gene-disease associations, especially for the less obvious 
ones. KC contribution also varies if obtained using recently discovered genes. 
Applied to 15 unsolved WES, GLOWgenes proposed three new genes to be involved in 
the phenotypes of patients with syndromic inherited retinal dystrophies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in aged population. 
Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis 
of AD. Investigation of hub genes for the development of potential therapeutic 
targets and candidate biomarkers is warranted. The differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) in AD were screened in GSE48350 dataset. The differentially 
expressed oxidative stress genes (DEOSGs) were analyzed by intersection of DEGs 
and oxidative stress-related genes. The immune-related DEOSGs and hub genes were 
identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, respectively. Enrichment analysis 
was performed by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The 
diagnostic value of hub genes was assessed by receiver operating characteristic 
analysis and validated in GSE1297. The mRNA expression of diagnostic genes was 
determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Finally, we constructed the drug, transcription 
factors (TFs), and microRNA network of the diagnostic genes. A total of 1160 
DEGs (259 up-regulated and 901 down-regulated) were screened in GSE48350. Among 
them 111 DEOSGs were identified in AD. Thereafter, we identified significant 
difference of infiltrated immune cells (effector memory CD8 T cell, activated B 
cell, memory B cell, natural killer cell, CD56 bright natural killer cell, 
natural killer T cell, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, and neutrophil) between AD 
and control samples. 27 gene modules were obtained through WGCNA and turquoise 
module was the most relevant module. We obtained 66 immune-related DEOSGs by 
intersecting turquoise module with the DEOSGs and identified 15 hub genes 
through PPI analysis. Among them, 9 hub genes (CCK, CNR1, GAD1, GAP43, NEFL, 
NPY, PENK, SST, and TAC1) were identified with good diagnostic values and 
verified in GSE1297. qRT-PCR analysis revealed the downregulation of SST, NPY, 
GAP43, CCK, and PENK and upregulation of NEFL in AD. Finally, we identified 76 
therapeutic agents, 152 miRNAs targets, and 91 TFs regulatory networks. Our 
study identified 9 key genes associated with oxidative stress and immune 
reaction in AD pathogenesis. The findings may help to provide promising 
candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a gastrointestinal disease with an 
underlying contribution of genetic, microbial, environment, immunity factors. 
The coding region risk markers identified by IBD genome wide association studies 
have not been well characterized at protein phenotype level. Therefore, this 
study is conducted to characterize the role of NOD2 (Arg675Trp and Gly908Arg) 
and IL23R (Gly149Arg and Arg381Gln) missense variants on the structural and 
functional features of corresponding proteins. Thus, we used different variant 
pathogenicity assays, molecular modelling, secondary structure, stability, 
molecular dynamics, and molecular docking analysis methods. Our findings suggest 
that SIFT, Polyphen, GREP++, PhyloP, SiPhy and REVEL methods are very sensitive 
in determining pathogenicity of NOD2 and IL23R missense variants. We have also 
noticed that all the tested missense variants could potentially alter secondary 
(α-helices, β-strands, and coils) and tertiary (residue level deviations) 
structural features. Moreover, our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation findings 
have simulated that NOD2 (Arg675Trp and Gly908Arg) and IL23R (Gly149Arg and 
Arg381Gln) variants creates rigid local structures comprising the protein 
flexibility and conformations. These predictions are corroborated by molecular 
docking results, where we noticed that NOD2 and IL23R missense variants induce 
molecular interaction deformities with RIPK2 and JAK2 ligand molecules, 
respectively. These functional alterations could potentially alter the signal 
transduction pathway cascade involved in inflammation and autoimmunity. Drug 
library searches and findings from docking studies have identified the 
inhibitory effects of Tacrolimus and Celecoxib drugs on NOD2 and IL23R variant 
forms, underlining their potential to contribute to personalized medicine for 
IBD. The present study supports the utilization of computational methods as 
primary filters (pre-in vitro and in vivo) in studying the disease potential 
mutations in the context of genptype-protein phenotype characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex illness with unknown 
pathophysiology. Peripheral biomarkers are a non-invasive method required to 
track the onset and progression of CAD and have unbeatable benefits in terms of 
early identification, prognostic assessment, and categorization of the 
diagnosis. This study aimed to identify and validate the diagnostic and 
therapeutic potential of differentially expressed immune-related genes (DE-IRGs) 
in CAD, which will aid in improving our knowledge on the etiology of CAD and in 
forming genetic predictions.
METHODS: First, we searched coronary heart disease in the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database and identified GSE20680 (CAD = 87, Normal = 52) as the 
trial set and GSE20681 (CAD = 99, Normal = 99) as the validation set. Functional 
enrichment analysis using protein-protein interactions (PPIs), Gene Ontology 
(GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was carried out on the 
identified differentially expressed genes. Optimal feature genes (OFGs) were 
generated using the support vector machine recursive feature elimination 
algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
algorithm. Furthermore, immune infiltration in CAD patients and healthy controls 
was compared using CIBERSORT, and the relationship between immune cells and OFGs 
was examined. In addition, we constructed potential targeted drugs for this 
model through the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb) database. Finally, we 
verify the expression of S100A8-dominated OFGs in the GSE20681 dataset to 
confirm the universality of our study.
RESULTS: We identified the ten best OFGs for CAD from the DE-IRGs. Functional 
enrichment analysis showed that these marker genes are crucial for 
receptor-ligand activity, signaling receptor activator activity, and positive 
control of the response to stimuli from the outside world. Additionally, 
CIBERSORT revealed that S100A8 could be connected to alterations in the immune 
microenvironment in CAD patients. Furthermore, with the help of DGIdb and 
Cytoscape, a total of 64 medicines that target five marker genes were 
subsequently discovered. Finally, we verified the expression of the OFGs genes 
in the GSE20681 dataset between CAD patients and normal patients and found that 
there was also a significant difference in the expression of S100A8.
CONCLUSION: We created a 10-gene immune-related prognostic model for CAD and 
confirmed its validity. The model can identify potential biomarkers for CAD 
prediction and more accurately gauge the progression of the disease.

Alternative splicing (AS) is a fundamental process that governs almost all 
aspects of cellular functions, and dysregulation in this process has been 
implicated in tumor initiation, progression and treatment resistance. With 
accumulating studies of carcinogenic mis-splicing in cancers, there is an urgent 
demand to integrate cancer-associated splicing changes to better understand 
their internal cross-talks and functional consequences from a global view. 
However, a resource of key functional AS events in human cancers is still 
lacking. To fill the gap, we developed ASCancer Atlas 
(https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ascancer), a comprehensive knowledgebase of aberrant 
splicing in human cancers. Compared to extant databases, ASCancer Atlas features 
a high-confidence collection of 2006 cancer-associated splicing events 
experimentally proved to promote tumorigenesis, a systematic splicing regulatory 
network, and a suit of multi-scale online analysis tools. For each event, we 
manually curated the functional axis including upstream splicing regulators, 
splicing event annotations, downstream oncogenic effects, and possible 
therapeutic strategies. ASCancer Atlas also houses about 2 million 
computationally putative splicing events. Additionally, a user-friendly web 
interface was built to enable users to easily browse, search, visualize, 
analyze, and download all splicing events. Overall, ASCancer Atlas provides a 
unique resource to study the functional roles of splicing dysregulation in human 
cancers.

The efficacy and safety of drugs are widely known to be determined by their 
interactions with multiple molecules of pharmacological importance, and it is 
therefore essential to systematically depict the molecular atlas and 
pharma-information of studied drugs. However, our understanding of such 
information is neither comprehensive nor precise, which necessitates the 
construction of a new database providing a network containing a large number of 
drugs and their interacting molecules. Here, a new database describing the 
molecular atlas and pharma-information of drugs (DrugMAP) was therefore 
constructed. It provides a comprehensive list of interacting molecules for >30 
000 drugs/drug candidates, gives the differential expression patterns for >5000 
interacting molecules among different disease sites, ADME (absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion)-relevant organs and physiological 
tissues, and weaves a comprehensive and precise network containing >200 000 
interactions among drugs and molecules. With the great efforts made to clarify 
the complex mechanism underlying drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and 
rapidly emerging interests in artificial intelligence (AI)-based network 
analyses, DrugMAP is expected to become an indispensable supplement to existing 
databases to facilitate drug discovery. It is now fully and freely accessible 
at: https://idrblab.org/drugmap/.

INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease is characterized of dysregulated inflammatory and 
immune reactions. The role of the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin 
domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in Crohn's disease remains largely 
unknown.
METHODS: The microarray-based transcriptomic data and corresponding clinical 
information of GSE100833 and GSE16879 were obtained from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database. Identification of in the NLRP3 inflammasome-related 
genes and construction of LASSO regression model. Immune landscape analysis was 
evaluated with ssGSEA. Classification of Crohn's-disease samples based on NLRP3 
inflammasome-related genes with ConsensusClusterPlus. Functional enrichment 
analysis, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and drug-gene interaction network.
RESULTS: The expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes were increased in 
diseased tissues, and higher expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes 
were correlated with generally enhanced immune cell infiltration, immune-related 
pathways and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-gene expressions. The gene-based 
signature showed well performance in the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Moreover, 
consensus clustering identified two Crohn's disease clusters based on NLRP3 
inflammasome-related genes, and cluster 2 was with higher expressions of the 
genes. Cluster 2 demonstrated upregulated activities of immune environment in 
Crohn's disease. Furthermore, four key hub genes were identified and potential 
drugs were explored for the treatment of Crohn's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome and its related genes 
could regulate immune cells and responses, as well as involve in the 
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease from transcriptomic aspects. These findings 
provide in silico insights into the diagnosis and treatment of Crohn's disease 
and might assist in the clinical decision-making process.

(1) Background: Perturbation of immune-related pathways can make substantial 
contributions to cancer. However, whether and how the aging process affects 
immune-related pathways during tumorigenesis remains largely unexplored. (2) 
Methods: Here, we comprehensively investigated the immune-related genes and 
pathways among 25 cancer types using genomic and transcriptomic data. (3) 
Results: We identified several pathways that showed aging-related 
characteristics in various cancers, further validated by conventional 
aging-related gene sets. Genomic analysis revealed high mutation burdens in 
cytokines and cytokines receptors pathways, which were strongly correlated with 
aging in diverse cancers. Moreover, immune-related pathways were found to be 
favorable prognostic factors in melanoma. Furthermore, the expression level of 
these pathways had close associations with patient response to immune checkpoint 
blockade therapy in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Applying a 
net-work-based method, we predicted immune- and aging-related genes in 
pan-cancer and utilized these genes for potential immunotherapy drug discovery. 
Mapping drug target data to our top-ranked genes identified potential drug 
targets, FYN, JUN, and SRC. (4) Conclusions: Taken together, our systematic 
study helped interpret the associations among immune-related pathways, aging, 
and cancer and could serve as a resource for promoting clinical treatment.

BACKGROUND: Except APOE, Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated genes identified in 
recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) had small effects and 
explained a small portion of heritability. Many AD-associated genes have even 
smaller effects thereby sub-threshold p-values in large-scale GWAS and remain to 
be identified. For some AD-associated genes, drug targeting them may have 
limited efficacies due to their small effect sizes.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify AD-associated genes with 
sub-threshold p-values and prioritize drugs targeting AD-associated genes that 
have large efficacies.
METHODS: We developed a gene-based polygenic risk score (PRS) to identify AD 
genes. It was calculated using SNPs located within genes and having the same 
directions of effects in different study cohorts to exclude cohort-specific 
findings and false positives. Gene co-expression modules and protein-protein 
interaction networks were used to identify AD-associated genes that interact 
with multiple other genes, as drugs targeting them have large efficacies via 
co-regulation or interactions.
RESULTS: Gene-based PRS identified 389 genes with 164 of them not previously 
reported as AD-associated. These 389 genes explained 56.12% -97.46% SNP 
heritability; and they were enriched in brain tissues and 164 biological 
processes, most of which are related to AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. 
We prioritized 688 drugs targeting 64 genes that were in the same co-expression 
modules and/or PPI networks.
CONCLUSIONS: Gene-based PRS is a cost-effective way to identify AD-associated 
genes without substantially increasing the sample size. Co-expression modules 
and PPI networks can be used to identify drugs having large efficacies.

BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic auto-inflammatory skin 
condition characterized by nodules, abscesses, and fistulae in skin folds. The 
underlying pathogenesis of HS remains unclear, and effective therapeutic drugs 
are limited.
METHODS: We acquired mRNA expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database and conducted differential expression analysis between control 
and HS samples using R software. Four machine learning algorithms (SVM, RF, ANN, 
and lasso) and WCGNA were utilized to identify feature genes. GO, KEGG, 
Metascape, and GSVA were utilized for the enrichment analysis. CIBERSORT and 
ssGSEA were employed to analyze immune infiltration.
RESULTS: A total of 29 DEGs were identified, with the majority showing 
up-regulation in HS. Enrichment analysis revealed their involvement in immune 
responses and cytokine activities. KEGG analysis highlighted pathways such as 
IL-17 signaling, rheumatoid arthritis, and TNF signaling in HS. Immune 
infiltration analysis revealed the predominant presence of neutrophils, 
monocytes, and CD8 T cells. Machine learning algorithms and WCGNA identified 
KYNU as a feature gene associated with HS. We have also identified 59 potential 
drugs for HS based on the DEGs. Additionally, ceRNA network analysis identified 
the MUC19_hsa-miR-382-5p_KYNU pathway as a potential regulatory pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: KYNU emerged as a feature gene associated with HS, and the ceRNA 
network analysis identified the MUC19_hsa-miR-382-5p_KYNU pathway as a potential 
regulator.

BACKGROUND: In the current study we have aimed to find the effects of 
Resveratrol treatment on platelet concentrates (PCs) at the dose dependent 
manner. We have also attempted to find the molecular mechanism of the effects.
METHODS: The PCs, have received from Iranian blood transfusion organization 
(IBTO). Totally 10 PCs were studied. The PCs divided into 4 groups including 
untreated (control) and treated by different dose of Resveratrol; 10, 30 and 50 
µM. Platelet aggregation and total reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were 
evaluated at day 3 of PCs storage. In silico analysis was carried out to find 
out the potential involved mechanisms.
RESULTS: The aggregation against collagen has fallen dramatically in all studied 
groups but at the same time, aggregation was significantly higher in the control 
versus treated groups (p<0.05). The inhibitory effect was dose dependent. The 
aggregation against Ristocetin did not significantly affect by Resveratrol 
treatment. The mean of total ROS significantly increased in all studied groups 
except those PCs treated with 10 µM of Resveratrol (P=0.9). The ROS level 
significantly increased with increasing Resveratrol concentration even more than 
control group (slope=11.6, P=0.0034). Resveratrol could potently interact with 
more than 15 different genes which, 10 of them enrolled in cellular regulation 
of the oxidative stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that the Resveratrol affect the platelet 
aggregation at the dose dependent manner. Moreover, we have also found that the 
Resveratrol play as double-edged sword in the controlling oxidative state of the 
cells. Therefore, Using the optimal dose of Resveratrol is the great of 
importance.

MOTIVATION: Identifying appropriate pharmacotherapy options from genomics 
results is a significant challenge in personalized oncology. However, 
computational methods for prioritizing drugs are underdeveloped. With the 
hypothesis that network-based approaches can improve the performance by 
extending the use of potential drug targets beyond direct interactions, we 
devised two network-based methods for personalized pharmacotherapy 
prioritization in cancer.
RESULTS: We developed novel personalized drug prioritization approaches, 
PANACEA: PersonAlized Network-based Anti-Cancer therapy EvaluAtion. In PANACEA, 
initially, the protein interaction network is extended with drugs, and a 
driverness score is assigned to each altered gene. For scoring drugs, either (i) 
the 'distance-based' method, incorporating the shortest distance between drugs 
and altered genes, and driverness scores, or (ii) the 'propagation' method 
involving the propagation of driverness scores via a random walk with restart 
framework is performed. We evaluated PANACEA using multiple datasets, and 
demonstrated that (i) the top-ranking drugs are relevant for cancer 
pharmacotherapy using TCGA data; (ii) drugs that cancer cell lines are sensitive 
to are identified using GDSC data; and (iii) PANACEA can perform adequately in 
the clinical setting using cases with known drug responses. We also illustrate 
that the proposed methods outperform iCAGES and PanDrugs, two previous 
personalized drug prioritization approaches.

MOTIVATION: The regulation of proteins governs the biological processes and 
functions and, therefore, the organisms' phenotype. So there is an unmet need 
for a systematic tool for identifying the proteins that play a crucial role in 
information processing in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. However, 
the current protein databases and web servers still lag behind to provide an 
end-to-end pipeline that can leverage the topological understanding of a 
context-specific PPI network to identify the influential spreaders. Addressing 
this, we developed a web application, 'konnect2prot' (k2p), which can generate 
context-specific directional PPI network from the input proteins and detect 
their biological and topological importance in the network.
RESULTS: We pooled together a large amount of ontological knowledge, parsed it 
down into a functional network, and gained insight into the molecular 
underpinnings of the disease development by creating a one-stop junction for PPI 
data. k2p contains both local and global information about a protein, such as 
protein class, disease mutations, ligands and PDB structure, enriched processes 
and pathways, multi-disease interactome and hubs and bottlenecks in the 
directional network. It also identifies spreaders in the network and maps them 
to disease hallmarks to determine whether they can affect the disease state or 
not.

The comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of breast cancer exosomes revealed 
that HSP90AA1, CCT2, and ENO1 were novel hub genes in the giant protein-protein 
interaction network of 110 exosomal proteins. Exosomes and their cargo such as 
discrete proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids are having potential role in the 
pathophysiology of breast cancer (BC). This study showed that the identified hub 
genes were particularly abundant in GO and KEGG pathways relevant to the 
positive regulation of telomerase. In addition, these hub genes were found to be 
considerably overexpressed in breast adenocarcinoma patients compared to healthy 
controls, and further, this overexpression is linked to the poor prognosis in BC 
patients. Furthermore, the ROC analysis revealed that CCT2 gene has strong 
diagnostic and prognostic value for BC. Additionally, this in silico analysis 
found that the anticancer agents and HSP90 inhibitors such as ganetespib, 
retaspimycin, and tanespimycin would have considerable potential in the 
treatment of BC. Overall, this study findings imply that HSP90AA1, a molecular 
chaperon and CCT2, a chaperonin would serve as diagnostic and prognostic 
biomarkers, respectively, for BC. However, these findings need to be further 
confirmed by laboratory and clinical studies for validating their potential 
applications.

PURPOSE: Drug development strategies for genetic diseases depend critically on 
accurate knowledge of how pathogenic variants cause disease. For some 
well-studied genes, the direct effects of pathogenic variants are well 
documented as loss-of-function, gain-of-function or hypermorphic, or a 
combination of the two. For many genes, however, even the direction of effect of 
variants remains unclear. Classification of Mendelian disease genes in terms of 
whether pathogenic variants are loss- or gain-of-function would directly inform 
drug development strategies.
METHODS: We leveraged the recent dramatic increase in reported pathogenic 
variants to provide a novel approach to inferring the direction of effect of 
pathogenic variants. Specifically, we quantify the ratio of reported pathogenic 
variants that are missense compared to loss-of-function.
RESULTS: We first show that for many genes that cause dominant Mendelian 
disease, the ratio of reported pathogenic missense variants is diagnostic of 
whether the gene causes disease through loss- or gain-of-function, or a 
combination. Second, we identify a set of genes that appear to cause disease 
largely or entirely through gain-of-function or hypermorphic pathogenic 
variants.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest a set of 16 genes suitable for drug developmental 
efforts utilizing direct inhibition.

BACKGROUND: In a genome-wide association study of intracranial aneurysms (IA), 
enrichment was found between genes associated with IA and genes encoding targets 
of effective anti-epileptic drugs. Our aim was to assess if this pleiotropy is 
driven by shared disease mechanisms that could potentially highlight a treatment 
strategy for IA.
METHODS: Using 2-sample inverse-variance weighted Mendelian randomization and 
genetic colocalization analyses we assessed: (1) if epilepsy liability in 
general affects IA risk, and (2) whether changes in gene- and protein-expression 
levels of anti-epileptic drug targets in blood and arterial tissue may causally 
affect IA risk.
RESULTS: We found no overall effect of epilepsy liability on IA. Expression of 
21 genes and 13 proteins corresponding to anti-epileptic drug targets supported 
a causal effect (P<0.05) on IA risk. Of those genes and proteins, genetic 
variants affecting CNNM2 levels showed strong evidence for colocalization with 
IA risk (posterior probability>70%). Higher CNNM2 levels in arterial tissue were 
associated with increased IA risk (odds ratio, 3.02; [95% CI, 2.32-3.94]; 
P=3.39×10-16). CNNM2 expression was best proxied by rs11191580. The magnitude of 
the effect of this variant was greater than would be expected if systemic blood 
pressure was the sole IA-causing mechanism in this locus.
CONCLUSIONS: CNNM2 is a driver of the pleiotropy between IA and anti-epileptic 
drug targets. Administration of the anti-epileptic drugs phenytoin, valproic 
acid, or carbamazepine may be expected to decrease CNNM2 levels and therefore 
subsequently decrease IA risk. CNNM2 is therefore an important target to 
investigate further for its role in the pathogenesis of IA.

BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary malignant bone 
tumor.
INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore potential key prognostic genes and 
their roles in osteosarcoma.
METHODS: Three microarray datasets for osteosarcoma were downloaded from the GEO 
database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by the Limma 
package. Functional enrichment analysis was performed based on DAVID, GeneMANIA, 
and Metascape databases. Prognostic value of DEGs was elevated by survival 
analysis. CIBERSORT was used to assess the infiltrating abundance of 22 immune 
cells, followed by the Pearson correlation analysis between immune cells and 
prognosis-related genes. Gene set enrichment analysis and drug-gene interactions 
prediction were performed for prognosis-related genes.
RESULTS: A total of 8 common up-regulated DEGs and 13 common down-regulated DEGs 
were screened in the GSE36001 and GSE56001 datasets. Enrichment analysis showed 
these DEGs were implicated in platelet activation, SMAD protein phosphorylation, 
lymphocyte/leukocyte/T cells activation, and cell migration. Survival analysis 
indicated that elevated expression of ADAM19 and TUBB1 were associated with a 
favorable prognosis. CIBERSORT algorithm revealed the higher infiltrating level 
of CD8 T cells, macrophages M0, and M2 in osteosarcoma. ADAM19 expression 
positively correlated with naïve B cells and negatively correlated with 
activated dendritic cells infiltrating abundance. TUBB1 expression positively 
correlated with gamma delta T cells while negatively correlated with helper 
follicular T cells infiltrating abundance. A total of 56 drugs were found to 
target TUBB1.
CONCLUSION: ADAM19 and TUBB1 could be prognostic biomarkers in osteosarcoma. 
Both their expression correlates with tumor infiltrating immune cells. TUBB1 was 
a multi-drug target that might be a therapeutic target in osteosarcoma.

BACKGROUND: This study utilized bioinformatics to analyze the underlying 
biological mechanisms involved in adipogenic differentiation, synthesis of the 
extracellular matrix (ECM), and angiogenesis during preadipocyte differentiation 
in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome at different time points and identify 
targets that can potentially improve fat graft survival.
RESULTS: We analyzed two expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at six different time 
points after the initiation of preadipocyte differentiation. Related pathways 
were identified using Gene Ontology/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
analyses and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We further constructed a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and its central genes. The results 
showed that upregulated DEGs were involved in cell differentiation, lipid 
metabolism, and other cellular activities, while downregulated DEGs were 
associated with angiogenesis and development, ECM tissue synthesis, and 
intercellular and intertissue adhesion. GSEA provided a more comprehensive 
basis, including participation in and positive regulation of key pathways of 
cell metabolic differentiation, such as the "peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor signaling pathway" and the "adenylate-activated protein kinase 
signaling pathway," a key pathway that negatively regulates pro-angiogenic 
development, ECM synthesis, and adhesion.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified the top 20 hub genes in the PPI network, including 
genes involved in cell differentiation, ECM synthesis, and angiogenesis 
development, providing potential targets to improve the long-term survival rate 
of fat grafts. Additionally, we identified drugs that may interact with these 
targets to potentially improve fat graft survival.

In this study, we explored the pyroptosis-related biomarkers and signatures of 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-COADREAD and were 
analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs in 
CRC‒pyroptosis-related genes (CRC‒PRGs) were obtained by intersecting DEGs 
associated with CRC and PRGs. The CRC‒PRGs were verified; functional enrichment 
analysis was performed with Gene Ontology (GO) followed by cluster analysis. Cox 
analyses and LASSO regression were used in TCGA dataset to construct a 
prognostic model for patients with CRC. A prognostic risk assessment model was 
constructed and efficacy was evaluated. Decision curve analysis was utilized to 
assess the role of the Lasso-Cox regression prognostic model for clinical 
utility at 1, 3, and 5 years. Twelve CRC‒PRGs were identified as prognostic 
pyroptosis-related DEGs. CXCL8, IL13RA2, MELK, and POP1 were selected as 
prognostic genes to construct features with a good prognostic performance in GEO 
and TCGA. Functional enrichment indicated that the 4-gene signature might be 
involved in CRC tumorigenesis and development through various pathways by 
playing a prognostic role in CRC. Furthermore, the results of the immune 
landscape analysis showed that the expression of CXCL8 and IL13RA2 in 
TCGA-COADREAD dataset was positively correlated with significant differential 
enrichment of most immune cells. A novel prognostic model consisting of four key 
genes, CXCL8, IL13RA2, MELK, and POP1, can accurately predict the survival of 
patients with CRC. This finding may provide a new perspective for the treatment 
of pyroptosis-related CRC.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore mechanisms of development and progression of 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
METHODS: The microRNA expression microarray GSE37914 and gene expression 
profiles GSE43264 and GSE98421 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
database. The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and genes (DEGs) were 
screened using Limma package. Then, the DEGs and DEmiRNAs were combined to use 
for the subsequent analysis, including the functional enrichment analysis, 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analysis, drug-gene 
interaction network analysis, and DEmiRNAs-DEGs interactive network 
construction.
RESULTS: A total of 26 DEmiRNAs and 80 DEGs were screened. The PPI network 
contained 68 nodes and 259 interactions. A significant clustering module with 8 
nodes and 25 interactions was obtained. Three PCOS-related overlapping pathways 
were obtained based on PPI-degree top10 and module genes, including prion 
diseases, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and Chagas disease (American 
trypanosomiasis). A total of 44 drug-gene interaction pairs were obtained, which 
included 2 up-regulated genes (LDLR and VCAM1), 4 down-regulated genes (C1QA, 
C1QB, IL6 and ACAN) and 26 small molecules drugs. A total of 52 nodes and 57 
interactions were obtained in the DEmiRNA-DEGs regulatory network, LDLR was 
regulated by miR-152-3p, miR-1207-5p, miR-378a-5p and miR-150-5p.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research has identified several key genes and pathways related 
to PCOS. These results can improve our understanding of PCOS and provide new 
basis for drug target research.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare progressive and 
chronic motor neuron degenerative disease for which at present no cure is 
available. In recent years, multiple genes encode kinases and other causative 
agents for ALS have been identified. Kinases are enzymes that show pleiotropic 
nature and regulate different signal transduction processes and pathways. The 
dysregulation of kinase activity results in dramatic changes in processes and 
causes many other human diseases including cancers.
METHODS: In this study, we have adopted a network-based system biology approach 
to investigate the kinase-based molecular interplay between ALS and other human 
disorders. A list of 62 ALS-associated-kinases was first identified and then we 
identified the disease associated with them by scanning multiple disease-gene 
interaction databases to understand the link between the ALS-associated kinases 
and other disorders.
RESULTS: An interaction network with 36 kinases and 381 different disorders 
associated with them was prepared, which represents the complexity and the 
comorbidity associated with the kinases. Further, we have identified 5 miRNAs 
targeting the majority of the kinases in the disease-causing network. The gene 
ontology and pathways enrichment analysis of those miRNAs were performed to 
understand their biological and molecular functions along with to identify the 
important pathways. We also identified 3 drug molecules that can perturb the 
disease-causing network by drug repurposing.
CONCLUSION: This network-based study presented hereby contributes to a better 
knowledge of the molecular underpinning of comorbidities associated with the 
kinases associated with the ALS disease and provides the potential therapeutic 
targets to disrupt the highly complex disease-causing network.

OBJECTIVES: Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CESC) is one of the most fatal 
female malignancies, and the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this 
disease have not been fully explored. In this research, we planned to conduct 
the analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cervical squamous cell carcinoma 
microarray datasets by a detailed in silico approach and to explore some novel 
biomarkers of CESC.
METHODS: The top commonly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the 
GSE138080 and GSE113942 datasets were analyzed by Limma package-based GEO2R 
tool. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was drawn 
through Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING), and top 6 
hub genes were obtained from Cytoscape. Expression analysis and validation of 
hub genes expression in CESC samples and cell lines were done using UALCAN, 
OncoDB, GENT2, and HPA. Additionally, cBioPortal, Gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) tool, Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter, ShinyGO, and DGIdb databases were also 
used to check some important values of hub genes in CESC.
RESULTS: Out of 79 DEGs, the minichromosome maintenance complex component 4 
(MCM4), nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1 (NUSAP1), cell division cycle 
associated 5 (CDCA5), cell division cycle 45 (CDC45), denticleless E3 ubiquitin 
protein ligase homolog (DTL), and chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 
1 (CDT1) genes were regarded as hub genes in CESC. Further analysis revealed 
that the expressions of all these hub genes were significantly elevated in CESC 
cell lines and samples of diverse clinical attributes. In this study, we also 
documented some important correlations between hub genes and some other diverse 
measures, including DNA methylation, genetic alterations, and Overall Survival 
(OS). Last, we also identify hub genes associated ceRNA network and 31 important 
chemotherapeutic drugs.
CONCLUSION: Through detailed in silico methodology, we identified 6 hub genes, 
including MCM4, NUSAP1, CDCA5, CDC45, DTL, and CDT1, which are likely to be 
associated with CESC development and diagnosis.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most lethal subtypes of 
breast cancer (BC), and it accounts for approximately 10%-20% of all invasive 
BCs diagnosed worldwide. The survival rate of TNBC in stages III and IV is very 
low, and a large number of patients are diagnosed in these stages. Therefore, 
the purpose of this study was to identify TNBC-causing molecular signatures and 
anti-TNBC drug agents for early diagnosis and therapies. Five microarray 
datasets that contained 304 TNBC and 109 control samples were collected from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and RNA-Seq data with 116 tumor and 124 
normal samples were collected from TCGA database to identify differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between TNBC and control samples. A total of 64 DEGs were 
identified, of which 29 were upregulated and 35 were downregulated, by using the 
statistical limma R-package. Among them, seven key genes (KGs) were commonly 
selected from microarray and RNA-Seq data based on the high degree of 
connectivity through PPI (protein-protein interaction) and module analysis. Out 
of these seven KGs, six KGs (TOP2A, BIRC5, AURKB, ACTB, ASPM, and BUB1B) were 
upregulated and one (EGFR) was downregulated. We also investigated their 
differential expression patterns with different subtypes and progression stages 
of BC by the independent datasets of RNA-seq profiles from UALCAN database, 
which indicated that they may be potential biomarkers for early diagnosis. Gene 
Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
enrichment analyses with the proposed DEGs were performed using the online 
Enrichr database to investigate the pathogenetic processes of TNBC highlighting 
KGs. Then, we performed gene regulatory network analysis and identified three 
transcriptional (SOX2, E2F4, and KDM5B) and three post-transcriptional 
(hsa-mir-1-3p, hsa-mir-124-3p, and hsa-mir-34a-5p) regulators of KGs. Finally, 
we proposed five KG-guided repurposable drug molecules (imatinib, regorafenib, 
pazopanib, teniposide, and dexrazoxane) for TNBC through network pharmacology 
and molecular docking analyses. These drug molecules also showed significant 
binding performance with some cancer-related PTM-sites (phosphorylation, 
succinylation, and ubiquitination) of top-ranked four key proteins (EGFR, AURKB, 
BIRC5, and TOP2A). Therefore, the findings of this computational study may play 
a vital role in early diagnosis and therapies against TNBC by wet-lab 
validation.

The drug development process consumes 9-12 years and approximately one billion 
US dollars in costs. Due to the high finances and time costs required by the 
traditional drug discovery paradigm, repurposing old drugs to treat cancer and 
rare diseases is becoming popular. Computational approaches are mainly 
data-driven and involve a systematic analysis of different data types leading to 
the formulation of repurposing hypotheses. This study presents a novel scoring 
algorithm based on chemical and genomic data to repurpose drugs for 669 diseases 
from 22 groups, including various cancers, musculoskeletal, infections, 
cardiovascular, and skin diseases. The data types used to design the scoring 
algorithm are chemical structures, drug-target interactions (DTI), pathways, and 
disease-gene associations. The repurposed scoring algorithm is strengthened by 
integrating the most comprehensive manually curated datasets for each data type.

Background: Primary liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and 
the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide in 2020, and it ranks fifth in 
global incidence. Liver resection or liver transplantation are the two most 
prominent surgical procedures for treating primary liver cancer. Both inevitably 
result in HIRI, causing severe complications for patients and affecting their 
prognosis and quality of survival. Ferroptosis, a newly discovered mode of cell 
death, is closely related to HIRI. We used bioinformatics analysis to explore 
the relationship between the two further. Methods: The GEO database dataset 
GSE112713 and the FerrDB database data were selected to use bioinformatic 
analysis methods (difference analysis, FRGs identification, GO analysis, KEGG 
analysis, PPI network construction and analysis, Hub gene screening with GO 
analysis and KEGG analysis, intergenic interaction prediction, drug-gene 
interaction prediction, miRNA prediction) for both for correlation analysis. The 
GEO database dataset GSE15480 was selected for preliminary validation of the 
screened Hub genes. Results: We analysed the dataset GSE112713 for differential 
gene expression before and after hepatic ischemia-reperfusion and identified by 
FRGs, yielding 11 genes. These 11 genes were subjected to GO, and KEGG analyses, 
and PPI networks were constructed and analysed. We also screened these 11 genes 
again to obtain 5 Hub genes and performed GO analysis, KEGG analysis, intergenic 
interaction prediction, drug-gene interaction prediction, and miRNA prediction 
on these 5 Hub genes. Finally, we obtained preliminary validation of all these 5 
Hub genes by dataset GSE15480. Conclusion: There is a close relationship between 
HIRI and ferroptosis, and inhibition of ferroptosis can potentially be a new 
approach to mitigate HIRI treatment in the future.

BACKGROUND: A lot of studies have revealed that chronic urticaria (CU) is 
closely linked with COVID-19. However, there is a lack of further study at the 
gene level. This research is aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of 
COVID-19-related CU via bioinformatic ways.
METHODS: The RNA expression profile datasets of CU (GSE72540) and COVID-19 
(GSE164805) were used for the training data and GSE57178 for the verification 
data. After recognizing the shared differently expressed genes (DEGs) of 
COVID-19 and CU, genes enrichment, WGCNA, PPI network, and immune infiltration 
analyses were performed. In addition, machine learning LASSO regression was 
employed to identify key genes from hub genes. Finally, the networks, 
gene-TF-miRNA-lncRNA, and drug-gene, of key genes were constructed, and RNA 
expression analysis was utilized for verification.
RESULTS: We recognized 322 shared DEGs, and the functional analyses displayed 
that they mainly participated in immunomodulation of COVID-19-related CU. 9 hub 
genes (CD86, FCGR3A, AIF1, CD163, CCL4, TNF, CYBB, MMP9, and CCL3) were explored 
through the WGCNA and PPI network. Moreover, FCGR3A, TNF, and CCL3 were further 
identified as key genes via LASSO regression analysis, and the ROC curves 
confirmed the dependability of their diagnostic value. Furthermore, our results 
showed that the key genes were significantly associated with the primary 
infiltration cells of CU and COVID-19, such as mast cells and macrophages M0. In 
addition, the key gene-TF-miRNA-lncRNA network was constructed, which contained 
46 regulation axes. And most lncRNAs of the network were proved to be a 
significant expression in CU. Finally, the key gene-drug interaction network, 
including 84 possible therapeutical medicines, was developed, and their 
protein-protein docking might make this prediction more feasible.
CONCLUSIONS: To sum up, FCGR3A, TNF, and CCL3 might be potential biomarkers for 
COVID-19-related CU, and the common pathways and related molecules we explored 
in this study might provide new ideas for further mechanistic research.

BACKGROUND: Activated cardiac fibroblasts (CF) play a central role in cardiac 
fibrosis, a condition associated with most cardiovascular diseases. Conversion 
of quiescent into activated CF sustains heart integrity upon injury. However, 
permanence of CF in active state inflicts deleterious heart function effects. 
Mechanisms underlying this cell state conversion are still not fully disclosed, 
contributing to a limited target space and lack of effective anti-fibrotic 
therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To prioritize targets for drug development, we studied CF 
remodeling upon activation at transcriptomic and proteomic levels, using three 
different cell sources: primary adult CF (aHCF), primary fetal CF (fHCF), and 
induced pluripotent stem cells derived CF (hiPSC-CF).
RESULTS: All cell sources showed a convergent response upon activation, with 
clear morphological and molecular remodeling associated with cell-cell and 
cell-matrix interactions. Quantitative proteomic analysis identified known 
cardiac fibrosis markers, such as FN1, CCN2, and Serpine1, but also revealed 
targets not previously associated with this condition, including MRC2, IGFBP7, 
and NT5DC2.
CONCLUSION: Exploring such targets to modulate CF phenotype represents a 
valuable opportunity for development of anti-fibrotic therapies. Also, we 
demonstrate that hiPSC-CF is a suitable cell source for preclinical research, 
displaying significantly lower basal activation level relative to primary cells, 
while being able to elicit a convergent response upon stimuli.

BACKGROUND: By affecting about 50 million people worldwide, epilepsy is 
considered a global concern in neurology. Intolerable enough, up to ¼ of all 
patients do not respond to antiepileptic drugs and have recurring seizures. 
Therefore, revealing the underlying etiology is quite demanding in a clinical 
context to improve diagnosis and disease management.
METHODS: Initially, 85 patients suspected of epilepsy underwent thorough 
clinical and paraclinical evaluation and 24 individuals with drug-resistant 
epilepsy entered the study. Using whole-exome sequencing, the genetic etiology 
of drug-resistant epilepsy was investigated and discerned whether this method 
could facilitate the management of drug-resistant epilepsy through personalized 
medicine. Eventually, functional annotation was performed and drug-gene 
interaction networks were constructed to find potential therapeutic targets.
RESULTS: We found eleven novel variants in various genes including IRF2BPL, 
ST3GAL3, and GPAA1, for which a few epilepsy-related variants are available in 
public databases. The overall diagnostic yield for likely pathogenic and 
pathogenic variants and the detection rate of novel variants were 25% and 84.6%, 
respectively. Based on the results, two patients were considered potential 
candidates for personalized medicine. The highest number of interaction with 
drugs was demonstrated for SCN1A, SCN2A, and GRIN2A genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the importance of consanguineous marriage in 
drug-resistant epilepsy and suggested the possibility of reduced penetrance and 
variable expressivity in some of the autosomal dominant cases. We also suggest 
that whole-exome sequencing could facilitate personalized management of 
drug-resistant epilepsy. Regarding drug-gene interactions, some genes such as 
SCN1A and SCN2A might serve as therapeutic targets in drug-resistant epilepsy.

A major challenge in translating genomic variants of Tuberculosis (TB) into 
clinical implementation is to integrate the disease-associated variants and 
facilitate drug discovery through the concept of genomic-driven drug 
repurposing. Here, we utilized two established genomic databases, namely a 
Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) and a Phenome-Wide Association Study 
(PheWAS) to identify the genomic variants associated with TB disease and further 
utilize them for drug-targeted genes. We evaluated 3.425 genomic variants 
associated with TB disease which overlapped with 200 TB-associated genes. To 
prioritize the biological TB risk genes, we devised an in-silico pipeline and 
leveraged an established bioinformatics method based on six functional 
annotations (missense mutation, cis-eQTL, biological process, cellular 
component, molecular function, and KEGG molecular pathway analysis). 
Interestingly, based on the six functional annotations that we applied, we 
discovered that 14 biological TB risk genes are strongly linked to the 
deregulation of the biological TB risk genes. Hence, we demonstrated that 12 
drug target genes overlapped with 40 drugs for other indications and further 
suggested that the drugs may be repurposed for the treatment of TB. We 
highlighted that CD44, CCR5, CXCR4, and C3 are highly promising proposed TB 
targets since they are connected to SELP and HLA-B, which are biological TB risk 
genes with high systemic scores on functional annotations. In sum, the current 
study shed light on the genomic variants involved in TB pathogenesis as the 
biological TB risk genes and provided empirical evidence that the genomics of TB 
may contribute to drug discovery.

Despite the identification of a growing number of genetic risk loci for 
substance use traits (SUTs), the impact of these loci on protein abundance and 
the potential utility of relevant proteins as therapeutic targets are unknown. 
We conducted a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) in which we integrated 
human brain proteomes from discovery (Banner; N = 152) and validation (ROSMAP; 
N = 376) datasets with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics 
for 4 SUTs. The 4 samples comprised GWAS of European-ancestry individuals for 
smoking initiation [Smk] (N = 1,232,091), alcohol use disorder [AUD] 
(N = 313,959), cannabis use disorder [CUD] (N = 384,032), and opioid use 
disorder [OUD] (N = 302,585). We conducted transcriptome-wide association 
studies (TWAS) with human brain transcriptomic data to examine the overlap of 
genetic effects at the proteomic and transcriptomic levels and characterize 
significant genes through conditional, colocalization, and fine-mapping 
analyses. We identified 27 genes (Smk = 21, AUD = 3, CUD = 2, OUD = 1) that were 
significantly associated with cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Of these, 7 
showed evidence for causality (Smk: NT5C2, GMPPB, NQO1, RHOT2, SRR and ACTR1B; 
and AUD: CTNND1). Cis-regulated transcript levels for 8 genes (Smk = 6, CUD = 1, 
OUD = 1) were associated with SUTs, indicating that genetic loci could confer 
risk for these SUTs by modulating both gene expression and proteomic abundance. 
Functional studies of the high-confidence risk proteins identified here are 
needed to determine whether they are modifiable targets and useful in developing 
medications and biomarkers for these SUTs.

Madison, WI, USA.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder, and increasing 
evidence suggests AD pathology is driven by metabolic dysfunction in the brain. 
Zinc is the second most abundant trace element found in the human body and is 
required by all living organisms. Zinc is used extensively in many biological 
processes, and alterations in zinc levels are implicated in the pathogenesis of 
numerous diseases, including AD. Since small fluctuations in brain zinc levels 
appear to effect AD progression, we investigated the zinc-related 
transcriptional responses in an AD versus non-AD state using microarray and 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from cultured cells, mice, and humans. We 
identified 582 zinc-related differentially expressed genes (DEG) in human 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples of late-onset AD (LOAD) versus non-AD 
controls, 146 zinc-related DEG in 5XFAD versus wild-type mice, and 95 
zinc-related DEG in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated N9 microglia versus 
unstimulated control cells, with 19 zinc-related DEG common to all three 
datasets. Of the 19 common DEG, functional enrichment and network analyses 
identified several biological processes and molecular functions, such as mRNA 
destabilization and nucleic acid binding, which may be important in 
neuroinflammation and AD development. Furthermore, therapeutic drugs targeting 
zinc-related DEG in the human dataset were identified. Taken together, these 
data provide insights into zinc utilization for gene transcription during AD 
progression which may further our understanding of AD pathogenesis and could 
identify new targets for therapeutic strategies targeted towards AD.

Obesity is a complex medical condition that affects multiple organs in the body. 
However, the underlying mechanisms of obesity, as well as its treatment, are 
largely unexplored. The focus of this research was to use bioinformatics to 
discover possible treatment targets for obesity. To begin, the GSE133099 
database was used to identify 364 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, 
DEGs were subjected to tissue-specific analyses and enrichment analyses, 
followed by the creation of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and 
generation of a drug-gene interaction database to screen key genes and potential 
future drugs targeting obesity. Findings have illustrated that the 
tissue-specific expression of neurologic markers varied significantly (34.7%, 
52/150). Among these genes, Lep, ApoE, Fyn, and FN1 were the key genes observed 
in the adipocyte samples from obese patients relative to the controls. 
Furthermore, nine potential therapeutic drugs (dasatinib, ocriplasmin, 
risperidone, gemfibrozil, ritonavir, fluvastatin, pravastatin, warfarin, 
atorvastatin) that target the key genes were also screened and selected. To 
conclude the key genes discovered (Lep, ApoE, Fyn, and FN1), as well as 9 
candidate drugs, could be used as therapeutic targets in treating obesity.

Psoriasis is a persistent T-cell-supported inflammatory cutaneous disorder, 
which is defined by a significant expansion of basal cells in the epidermis. 
Cell cycle and STAT genes that control cell cycle progression and viral 
infection have been revealed to be comorbid with the development of certain 
cancers and other disorders, due to their abnormal or scanty expression. The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression of certain cell cycle and 
STAT1/3 genes in psoriasis patients and to determine the types of comorbidities 
associated with these genes. To do so, we opted to adopt the in silico 
methodology, since it is a quick and easy way to discover any potential 
comorbidity risks that may exist in psoriasis patients. With the genes collected 
from early research groups, protein networks were created in this work using the 
NetworkAnalyst program. The crucial hub genes were identified by setting the 
degree parameter, and they were then used in gene ontology and pathway 
assessments. The transcription factors that control the hub genes were detected 
by exploring TRRUST, and DGIdb was probed for remedies that target transcription 
factors and hubs. Using the degree filter, the first protein subnetwork produced 
seven hub genes, including STAT3, CCNB1, STAT1, CCND1, CDC20, HSPA4, and MAD2L1. 
The hub genes were shown to be implicated in cell cycle pathways by the gene 
ontology and Reactome annotations. The former four hubs were found in signaling 
pathways, including prolactin, FoxO, JAK/STAT, and p53, according to the KEGG 
annotation. Furthermore, they enhanced several malignancies, including 
pancreatic cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and acute 
myeloid leukemia. Viral infections, including measles, hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr 
virus, and HTLV-1 and viral carcinogenesis were among the other susceptible 
diseases. Diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease were conjointly annotated. In 
total, 129 medicines were discovered in DGIdb to be effective against the 
transcription factors BRCA1, RELA, TP53, and MYC, as opposed to 10 medications 
against the hubs, STAT3 and CCND1, in tandem with 8 common medicines. The study 
suggests that the annotated medications should be tested in suitable psoriatic 
cell lines and animal models to optimize the drugs used based on the kind, 
severity, and related comorbidities of psoriasis. Furthermore, a personalized 
medicine protocol must be designed for each psoriasis patient that displays 
different comorbidities.

To investigate similarities in the gene profile of Oral Lichen Planus and Oral 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma that may justify a carcinogenic potential, we analyzed 
the gene expression signatures of Oral Lichen Planus and Oral Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma in early and advanced stages. Based on gene expression data from 
public databases, we used a bioinformatics approach to compare expression 
profiles, estimate immune infiltrate composition, identify differentially and 
co-expressed genes, and propose putative therapeutic targets and associated 
drugs. Our results revealed gene expression patterns related to processes of 
keratinization, keratinocyte differentiation, cell proliferation and immune 
response in common between Oral Lichen Planus and early and advanced Oral 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma, with the cornified envelope formation and antigen 
processing cross-presentation pathways in common between Oral Lichen Planus and 
early Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Together, these results reveal that key 
tumor suppressors and oncogenes such as PI3, SPRR1B and KRT17, as well as genes 
associated with different immune processes such as CXCL13, HIF1A and IL1B are 
dysregulated in OLP.

Uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) is the most frequent subtype of uterine sarcoma 
that presents a poor prognosis, high rates of recurrence, and metastasis. 
Currently, the molecular mechanism of the origin and development of uLMS is 
unknown. Class I histone deacetylases (including HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) are one of 
the major classes of the HDAC family and catalyze the removal of acetyl groups 
from lysine residues in histones and cellular proteins. Class I HDACs exhibit 
distinct cellular and subcellular expression patterns and are involved in many 
biological processes and diseases through diverse signaling pathways. However, 
the link between class I HDACs and uLMS is still being determined. In this 
study, we assessed the expression panel of Class I HDACs in uLMS and 
characterized the role and mechanism of class I HDACs in the pathogenesis of 
uLMS. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that HDAC1, 2, and 3 are aberrantly 
upregulated in uLMS tissues compared to adjacent myometrium. Immunoblot analysis 
demonstrated that the expression levels of HDAC 1, 2, and 3 exhibited a graded 
increase from normal and benign to malignant uterine tumor cells. Furthermore, 
inhibition of HDACs with Class I HDACs inhibitor (Tucidinostat) decreased the 
uLMS proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, gene set enrichment 
analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that inhibition of 
HDACs with Tucidinostat altered several critical pathways. Moreover, multiple 
epigenetic analyses suggested that Tucidinostat may alter the transcriptome via 
reprogramming the oncogenic epigenome and inducing the changes in 
microRNA-target interaction in uLMS cells. In the parallel study, we also 
determined the effect of DL-sulforaphane on the uLMS. Our study demonstrated the 
relevance of class I HDACs proteins in the pathogenesis of malignant uLMS. 
Further understanding the role and mechanism of HDACs in uLMS may provide a 
promising and novel strategy for treating patients with this aggressive uterine 
cancer.

The druggability of targets is a crucial consideration in drug target selection. 
Here, we adopt a stochastic semi-supervised ML framework to develop DrugnomeAI, 
which estimates the druggability likelihood for every protein-coding gene in the 
human exome. DrugnomeAI integrates gene-level properties from 15 sources 
resulting in 324 features. The tool generates exome-wide predictions based on 
labelled sets of known drug targets (median AUC: 0.97), highlighting features 
from protein-protein interaction networks as top predictors. DrugnomeAI provides 
generic as well as specialised models stratified by disease type or drug 
therapeutic modality. The top-ranking DrugnomeAI genes were significantly 
enriched for genes previously selected for clinical development programs (p 
value < 1 × 10-308) and for genes achieving genome-wide significance in 
phenome-wide association studies of 450 K UK Biobank exomes for binary (p 
value = 1.7 × 10-5) and quantitative traits (p value = 1.6 × 10-7). We accompany 
our method with a web application ( http://drugnomeai.public.cgr.astrazeneca.com 
) to visualise the druggability predictions and the key features that define 
gene druggability, per disease type and modality.

Drug-target association plays an important role in drug discovery, drug 
repositioning, drug synergy prediction, etc. Currently, a lot of drug-related 
databases, such as DrugBank and BindingDB, have emerged. However, these 
databases are separate, incomplete and non-uniform with different criteria. 
Here, we integrated eight drug-related databases; collected, filtered and 
supplemented drugs, target genes and experimentally validated (highly confident) 
associations and built a highly confident drug-target (HCDT: 
http://hainmu-biobigdata.com/hcdt) database. HCDT database includes 500 681 HCDT 
associations between 299 458 drugs and 5618 target genes. Compared to individual 
databases, HCDT database contains 1.1 to 254.2 times drugs, 1.8-5.5 times target 
genes and 1.4-27.7 times drug-target associations. It is normative, publicly 
available and easy for searching, browsing and downloading. Together with 
multi-omics data, it will be a good resource in analyzing the drug functional 
mechanism, mining drug-related biological pathways, predicting drug synergy, 
etc. Database URL: http://hainmu-biobigdata.com/hcdt.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected hundreds of millions of people 
and caused millions of deaths. Looking for valid druggable targets with minimal 
side effects for the treatment of COVID-19 remains critical. After discovering 
host genes from multiscale omics data, we developed an end-to-end network method 
to investigate drug-host gene(s)-coronavirus (CoV) paths and the mechanism of 
action between the drug and the host factor in a directional network. We also 
inspected the potential side effect of the candidate drug on several common 
comorbidities. We established a catalog of host genes associated with three 
CoVs. Rule-based prioritization yielded 29 Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)-approved drugs via accounting for the effects of drugs on CoVs, 
comorbidities, and drug-target confidence information. Seven drugs are currently 
undergoing clinical trials as COVID-19 treatment. This catalog of druggable host 
genes associated with CoVs and the prioritized repurposed drugs will provide a 
new sight in therapeutics discovery for severe COVID-19 patients.

Cancer hallmark genes and proteins orchestrate and drive carcinogenesis to a 
large extent, therefore, it is important to study these features in different 
cancer types to understand the process of tumorigenesis and discover measurable 
indicators. We performed a pan-cancer analysis to map differentially interacting 
hallmarks of cancer proteins (DIHCP). The TCGA transcriptome data associated 
with 12 common cancers were analyzed and the differential interactome algorithm 
was applied to determine DIHCPs and DIHCP-centric modules (i.e., DIHCPs and 
their interacting partners) that exhibit significant changes in their 
interaction patterns between the tumor and control phenotypes. The diagnostic 
and prognostic capabilities of the identified modules were assessed to determine 
the ability of the modules to function as system biomarkers. In addition, the 
druggability of the prognostic and diagnostic DIHCPs was investigated. As a 
result, we found a total of 30 DIHCP-centric modules that showed high diagnostic 
or prognostic performance in any of the 12 cancer types. Furthermore, from the 
16 DIHCP-centric modules examined, 29% of these were druggable. Our study 
presents candidate systems' biomarkers that may be valuable for understanding 
the process of tumorigenesis and improving personalized treatment strategies for 
various cancers, with a focus on their ten hallmark characteristics.

Objective: The aim of this study was to construct a microRNA (miRNA)-messenger 
RNA (mRNA)-transcription factor (TF) regulatory network and explore underlying 
molecular mechanisms, effective biomarkers, and drugs in renal fibrosis (RF). 
Methods: A total of six datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. 
"Limma" and "DESeq2" packages in R software and GEO2R were applied to identify 
the differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs (DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs, 
respectively). The determination and verification of DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs were 
performed through the integrated analysis of datasets from five mouse 7 days of 
unilateral ureteral obstruction datasets and one human chronic kidney disease 
dataset and the Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org). Target mRNAs 
of DEmiRNAs and TFs were predicted by prediction databases and the iRegulon 
plugin in Cytoscape, respectively. A protein-protein interaction network was 
constructed using STRING, Cytoscape v3.9.1, and CytoNCA. Functional enrichment 
analysis was performed by DIANA-miRPath v3.0 and R package "clusterProfiler." A 
miRNA-mRNA-TF network was established using Cytoscape. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to examine the diagnostic value of 
the key hub genes. Finally, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and 
Drug-Gene Interaction database were applied to identify potential drugs. 
Results: Here, 4 DEmiRNAs and 11 hub genes were determined and confirmed in five 
mouse datasets, of which Bckdha and Vegfa were further verified in one human 
dataset and HPA, respectively. Moreover, Bckdha and Vegfa were also predicted by 
miR-125a-3p and miR-199a-5p, respectively, in humans as in mice. The sequences 
of miR-125a-3p and miR-199a-5p in mice were identical to those in humans. A 
total of 6 TFs were predicted to regulate Bckdha and Vegfa across mice and 
humans; then, a miRNA-mRNA-TF regulatory network was built. Subsequently, ROC 
curve analysis showed that the area under the curve value of Vegfa was 0.825 (p 
= 0.002). Finally, enalapril was identified to target Vegfa for RF therapy. 
Conclusion: Pax2, Pax5, Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 together with Bckdha-dependent 
miR-125a-3p/Vegfa-dependent miR-199a-5p formed a co-regulatory network enabling 
Bckdha/Vegfa to be tightly controlled in the underlying pathogenesis of RF 
across mice and humans. Vegfa could act as a potential novel diagnostic marker 
and might be targeted by enalapril for RF therapy.

Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARPi) are increasingly employed as 
salvage therapy in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), but cytotoxic drug exposure 
along with PARP inhibition may favor development of hematological disorders. In 
our study, of 182 women with EOC treated with PARPi, 16 (8.7%) developed 
therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs), with 12 cases of myelodysplasia and 4 
of acute myeloid leukemia. All experienced persistent cytopenia after PARPi 
discontinuation. Seven patients had del(5q)/-5 and/or del(7q)/-7, nine had a 
complex karyotype and TP53 mutations, recently reported as risk factor for t-MNs 
in EOC post-PARPi, were found in 12 out of 13 tested patients. Four patients had 
a rapid and fatal outcome, one had stable disease, eleven underwent induction 
therapy, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in seven. 
Three of these 11 patients experienced refractory disease, and 8 had complete 
remission. During a 6.8 months (range 2.3-49) median observation time, 3 out of 
16 patients were alive, with one surviving patient free of both solid and 
hematological tumors. Ten patients died because of leukemia, two because of 
transplant-related events, one from heart failure. Five more patients 
experienced persistent cell blood count abnormalities following PARPi 
discontinuation, without reaching MDS diagnostic criteria. A customized 
Myelo-panel showed clonal hematopoiesis in all five patients. These findings 
confirm the actual risk of t-MNs in EOC patients after chemotherapy and 
prolonged PARPi therapy. The management of these patients is complex and 
outcomes are extremely poor. Careful diagnostic procedures are strongly 
recommended whenever unusual cytopenias develop in patients receiving PARPi 
therapy.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to explore the pathological mechanisms of 
chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) using a gene chip array 
and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mRNA expression profile GSE130391 was downloaded from 
the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The peripheral blood samples of five CTEPH 
patients and five healthy controls were used to prepare the Affymetrix microRNA 
(miRNA) chip and the Agilent circular RNA (circRNA) chip. The pulmonary 
endarterectomized tissues from five CTEPH patients were analyzed by scRNA-seq. 
Cells were clustered and annotated, followed by the identification of highly 
expressed genes. The gene chip data were used to identify disease-related mRNAs 
and differentially expressed miRNAs and circRNAs. The protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network and the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network were constructed 
for each cell type.
RESULTS: A total of 11 cell types were identified. Intersection analysis of 
highly expressed genes in each cell type and differentially expressed mRNAs were 
performed to obtain disease-related genes in each cell type. TP53, ICAM1, APP, 
ITGB2, MYC, and ZYX showed the highest degree of connectivity in the PPI network 
of different types of cells. In addition, the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network for 
each cell type was constructed.
CONCLUSION: For the first time, the key mRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs, as well as 
their possible regulatory relationships, during the progression of CTEPH were 
analyzed using both gene chip and scRNA-seq data. These findings may contribute 
to a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms of CTEPH.

Drug repositioning, an important method of drug development, is utilized to 
discover investigational drugs beyond the originally approved indications, 
expand the application scope of drugs, and reduce the cost of drug development. 
With the emergence of increasingly drug-disease-related biological networks, the 
challenge still remains to effectively fuse biological entity data and 
accurately achieve drug-disease repositioning. This paper proposes a new drug 
repositioning method named EMPHCN based on enhanced message passing and 
hypergraph convolutional networks (HGCN). It firstly constructs the homogeneous 
multi-view information with multiple drug similarity features and then extracts 
the intra-domain embedding of drugs through the combination of HGCN and channel 
attention mechanism. Secondly, inter-domain information of known drug-disease 
associations is extracted by graph convolutional networks combining node and 
edge embedding (NEEGCN), and a heterogeneous network composed of drugs, proteins 
and diseases is built as an important auxiliary to enhance the inter-domain 
message passing of drugs and diseases. Besides, the intra-domain embedding of 
diseases is also extracted through HGCN. Ultimately, intra-domain and 
inter-domain embeddings of drugs and diseases are integrated as the final 
embedding for calculating the drug-disease correlation matrix. Through 10-fold 
cross-validation on some benchmark datasets, we find that the AUPR of EMPHCN 
reaches 0.593 (T1) and 0.526 (T2), respectively, and the AUC achieves 0.887 (T1) 
and 0.961 (T2) respectively, which shows that EMPHCN has an advantage over other 
state-of-the-art prediction methods. Concerning the new disease association 
prediction, the AUC of EMPHCN through the five-fold cross-validation reaches 
0.806 (T1) and 0.845 (T2), which are 4.3% (T1) and 4.0% (T2) higher than the 
second best existing methods, respectively. In the case study, EMPHCN also 
achieves satisfactory results in real drug repositioning for breast carcinoma 
and Parkinson's disease.

Viruses co-opt host proteins to carry out their lifecycle. Repurposed host 
proteins may thus become functionally compromised; a situation analogous to a 
loss-of-function mutation. We term such host proteins as viral-induced 
hypomorphs. Cells bearing cancer driver loss-of-function mutations have 
successfully been targeted with drugs perturbing proteins encoded by the 
synthetic lethal (SL) partners of cancer-specific mutations. Similarly, SL 
interactions of viral-induced hypomorphs can potentially be targeted as 
host-based antiviral therapeutics. Here, we use GBF1, which supports the 
infection of many RNA viruses, as a proof-of-concept. GBF1 becomes a hypomorph 
upon interaction with the poliovirus protein 3A. Screening for SL partners of 
GBF1 revealed ARF1 as the top hit, disruption of which selectively killed cells 
that synthesize 3A alone or in the context of a poliovirus replicon. Thus, viral 
protein interactions can induce hypomorphs that render host cells selectively 
vulnerable to perturbations that leave uninfected cells otherwise unscathed. 
Exploiting viral-induced vulnerabilities could lead to broad-spectrum antivirals 
for many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

The ErbB lineage of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases is frequently 
overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. A common co-regulon 
triggered by the ErbB proteins; involving shared signaling circuitries; may 
harbor co-druggable targets or response biomarkers for potential future 
multimodal precision therapy in ErbB-driven head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma. We here present a cohort-based; genome-wide analysis of 488 head and 
neck squamous cell carcinomas curated as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas Project 
to characterize genes that are significantly positively co-regulated with the 
four ErbB proteins and those that are shared among all ErbBs denoting a common 
ErbB co-regulon. Significant positive gene correlations involved hundreds of 
genes that were co-expressed with the four ErbB family members (q < 0.05). A 
common; overlapping co-regulon consisted of a core set of 268 genes that were 
uniformly co-regulated with all four ErbB genes and highly enriched for 
functions in chromatin organization and histone modifications. This 
high-priority set of genes contained ten putative antineoplastic drug-gene 
interactions. The nature and directionality of these ten drug-gene associations 
was an inhibiting interaction for seven (PIK3CB; PIK3C2B; HDAC4; FRK; PRKCE; 
EPHA4; and DYRK1A) of them in which the drug decreases the biological activity 
or expression of the gene target. For three (CHD4; ARID1A; and PBRM1) of the 
associations; the directionality of the interaction was such that the gene 
predicted sensitivit y to the drug suggesting utility as potential response 
biomarkers. Drug-gene interactions that predicted the gene product to be reduced 
by the drug included a variety of potential targeted molecular agent classes. 
This unbiased genome-wide analysis identified a target-rich environment for 
multimodal therapeutic approaches in tumors that are putatively ErbB-driven. The 
results of this study require preclinical validation before ultimately devising 
lines of combinatorial treatment strategies for ErbB-dependent head and neck 
squamous cell carcinomas that incorporate these findings.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive Schwann 
cell (SC)-derived soft tissue sarcoma, arises from benign neurofibroma (NF); 
however, the identity, heterogeneity and origins of tumor populations remain 
elusive. Nestin+ cells have been implicated as tumor stem cells in MPNST; 
unexpectedly, single-cell profiling of human NF and MPNST and their animal 
models reveal a broad range of nestin-expressing SC lineage cells and dynamic 
acquisition of discrete cancer states during malignant transformation. We 
uncover a nestin-negative mesenchymal neural crest-like subpopulation as a 
previously unknown malignant stem-like state common to murine and human MPNSTs, 
which correlates with clinical severity. Integrative multiomics profiling 
further identifies unique regulatory networks and druggable targets against the 
malignant subpopulations in MPNST. Targeting key epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition and stemness regulators including ZEB1 and ALDH1A1 impedes MPNST 
growth. Together, our studies reveal the underlying principles of tumor 
cell-state evolution and their regulatory circuitries during NF-to-MPNST 
transformation, highlighting a hitherto unrecognized mesenchymal stem-like 
subpopulation in MPNST disease progression.

Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of both morbidity and mortality 
worldwide. It is widely accepted that both concomitant medications (drug-drug 
interactions, DDIs) and genomic factors (drug-gene interactions, DGIs) can 
influence cardiovascular drug-related efficacy and safety outcomes. Although 
thousands of DDI and DGI (aka pharmacogenomic) studies have been published to 
date, the literature on drug-drug-gene interactions (DDGIs, cumulative effects 
of DDIs and DGIs) remains scarce. Moreover, multimorbidity is common in 
cardiovascular disease patients and is often associated with polypharmacy, which 
increases the likelihood of clinically relevant drug-related interactions. 
These, in turn, can lead to reduced drug efficacy, medication-related harm 
(adverse drug reactions, longer hospitalizations, mortality) and increased 
healthcare costs. To examine the extent to which DDGIs and other interactions 
influence efficacy and safety outcomes in the field of cardiovascular medicine, 
we review current evidence in the field. We describe the different categories of 
DDIs and DGIs before illustrating how these two interact to produce DDGIs and 
other complex interactions. We provide examples of studies that have reported 
the prevalence of clinically relevant interactions and the most implicated 
cardiovascular medicines before outlining the challenges associated with dealing 
with these interactions in clinical practice. Finally, we provide 
recommendations on how to manage the challenges including but not limited to 
expanding the scope of drug information compendia, interaction databases and 
clinical implementation guidelines (to include clinically relevant DDGIs and 
other complex interactions) and work towards their harmonization; better use of 
electronic decision support tools; using big data and novel computational 
techniques; using clinically relevant endpoints, preemptive genotyping; ensuring 
ethnic diversity; and upskilling of clinicians in pharmacogenomics and 
personalized medicine.

Immune checkpoint therapies, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
blockade, have shown remarkable clinical benefit in many cancers by restoring 
the function of exhausted T cells. Hence, the identification of novel PD-L1 
regulators and the development of their inhibition strategies have significant 
therapeutic advantages. Here, we conducted pooled shRNA screening to identify 
regulators of membrane PD-L1 levels in lung cancer cells targeting druggable 
genes and cancer drivers. We identified WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 3 
(WNK3) as a novel positive regulator of PD-L1 expression. The kinase-dead WNK3 
mutant failed to elevate PD-L1 levels, indicating the involvement of its kinase 
domain in this function. WNK3 perturbation increased cancer cell death in cancer 
cell-immune cell coculture conditions and boosted the secretion of cytokines and 
cytolytic enzymes, promoting antitumor activities in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. 
WNK463, a pan-WNK inhibitor, enhanced CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor activity 
and suppressed tumor growth as a monotherapy as well as in combination with a 
low-dose anti-PD-1 antibody in the MC38 syngeneic mouse model. Furthermore, we 
demonstrated that the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-JUN pathway underlies 
WNK3-mediated transcriptional regulation of PD-L1. Our findings highlight that 
WNK3 inhibition might serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer 
immunotherapy through its concurrent impact on cancer cells and immune cells.

Traditional Chinese medicine, as a complementary and alternative medicine, has 
been practiced for thousands of years in China and possesses remarkable clinical 
efficacy. Thus, systematic analysis and examination of the mechanistic links 
between Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and the complex human body can benefit 
contemporary understandings by carrying out qualitative and quantitative 
analysis. With increasing attention, the approach of network pharmacology has 
begun to unveil the mystery of CHM by constructing the heterogeneous network 
relationship of "herb-compound-target-pathway," which corresponds to the 
holistic mechanisms of CHM. By integrating computational techniques into network 
pharmacology, the efficiency and accuracy of active compound screening and 
target fishing have been improved at an unprecedented pace. This review dissects 
the core innovations to the network pharmacology approach that were developed in 
the years since 2015 and highlights how this tool has been applied to 
understanding the coronavirus disease 2019 and refining the clinical use of CHM 
to combat it.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify the role of ferroptosis in intracranial 
aneurysm (IA).
METHODS: GSE122897, GSE75436, GSE15629, and GSE75434 datasets were downloaded 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed 
ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) were selected to construct a diagnostic model 
integrating with machine learning. Then, a consensus clustering algorithm was 
performed to classify IA patients into distinct ferroptosis-related clusters. 
Functional analyses, including GO, KEGG, GSVA, and GSEA analyses, were conducted 
to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. ssGSEA and xCell algorithms were 
performed to uncover the immune characteristics.
RESULTS: We identified 28 DEFRGs between IAs and controls from the GSE122897 
dataset. GO and KEGG results showed that these genes were enriched in cytokine 
activity, ferroptosis, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. Immune analysis showed 
that the IAs had higher levels of immune infiltration. A four FRGs model (MT3, 
CDKN1A, ZEP69B, and ABCC1) was established and validated with great IA 
diagnostic ability. We divided the IA samples into two clusters and found that 
cluster 2 had a higher proportion of rupture and immune infiltration. We 
identified 10 ferroptosis phenotypes-related markers in IAs.
CONCLUSION: Ferroptosis and the immune microenvironment are closely associated 
with IAs, providing a basis for understanding the IA development.

Tumour heterogeneity is one of the main characteristics of cancer and can be 
categorised into inter- or intratumour heterogeneity. This heterogeneity has 
been revealed as one of the key causes of treatment failure and relapse. 
Precision oncology is an emerging field that seeks to design tailored treatments 
for each cancer patient according to epidemiological, clinical and omics data. 
This discipline relies on bioinformatics tools designed to compute scores to 
prioritise available drugs, with the aim of helping clinicians in treatment 
selection. In this review, we describe the current approaches for therapy 
selection depending on which type of tumour heterogeneity is being targeted and 
the available next-generation sequencing data. We cover intertumour 
heterogeneity studies and individual treatment selection using genomics 
variants, expression data or multi-omics strategies. We also describe 
intratumour dissection through clonal inference and single-cell transcriptomics, 
in each case providing bioinformatics tools for tailored treatment selection. 
Finally, we discuss how these therapy selection workflows could be integrated 
into the clinical practice.

Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) is an anaerobic parasite that causes 
Amoebiasis in the intestine or extraintestinal, with immunology, genetics, and 
environmental variables all playing a part in the disease's development, but its 
molecular mechanism is unknown. One of the primary obstacles in understanding 
the etiology of Amoebiasis will be identifying the genetics profiling that 
controls the Amoebiasis network. By examining the gene expression profile of 
Amoebiasis and comparing it with healthy controls, we could identify 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs were used to build the Amoebiasis 
protein interaction network and calculated its network topological properties. 
We discovered nine key hub genes (KHGs): JUN, PTGS2, FCGR3A, MNDA, CYBB, EGR1, 
CCL2, TLR8, and LRRK2 genes. The genes JUN and EGR1 were transcriptional factors 
(TFs) and up-regulated, others down-regulated. hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-101-3p, 
hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-26b-5p, and hsa-miR-16-5p are also among the essential 
miRNAs that have been demonstrated to be targeted by KHGs. These KHGs were 
primarily enriched in the IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, 
NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. 
miRNAs were grouped in various pathways, focusing on the TGF-β signaling 
pathway, human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection, insulin signaling pathway, 
signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, etc. Amoebiasis KHGs 
(JUN, PTGS2, CCL2, and MNDA) and their associated miRNAs are the primary targets 
for therapeutic methods and possible biomarkers. Furthermore, we identified 
drugs for genes JUN, PTGS2, FCGR3A, CCL2, and LRRK2. KHGs, on the other hand, 
required experimental validation to prove their efficacy.

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated death in 
women. Despite the progress in therapeutic regimen, resistance and recurrence of 
breast cancer have affected the overall survival of patients. The present 
signatures, such as PAM50 and Oncotype DX, do not segregate the Indian breast 
samples based on molecular subtypes. This study aims at finding signatures of 
long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and mRNA in Indian breast cancer patients using 
RNA-seq. We have analyzed the survival based on the menopausal and hormone 
status of 380 Indian breast cancer patients, and of these, we have sequenced and 
analyzed matched tumor-normal transcriptome of 17 (pre- and postmenopausal) 
Indian breast cancer patients representing six different subtypes, namely, four 
patients in triple-positive, three patients in estrogen receptor-positive 
(ER+ve), three patients in estrogen and progesterone receptors-positive (ER+ve, 
PR+ve), two patients in human epidermal growth factor receptor (Her2+ve), three 
patients in triple-negative, and one patient in ER+ve and Her2+ve subtypes. We 
have identified a 25 mRNA-27 lncRNA gene set, which segregated the subtypes in 
our data. A pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed 
downregulated ECM interaction and upregulated immune regulation, cell cycle, DNA 
damage response and repair, and telomere elongation in premenopausal women. 
Postmenopausal women showed downregulated metabolism, innate immune system, 
upregulated translation, sumoylation, and AKT2 activation. A Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis revealed that menopausal status, grade of the tumor, and 
hormonal status displayed statistically significant effects (p < 0.05) on the 
risk of mortality due to breast cancer. Her2+ve patients showed low overall 
survival. One of the unique lncRNA-mRNA pairs specific to the EP-subtype, SNHG12 
and EPB41, showed interaction, which correlates with their expression level; 
SNHG12 is downregulated and EPB41 is upregulated in EP samples.

BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain (NP) caused by a lesion or disease of the 
somatosensory nervous system is a common chronic pain condition that has a major 
impact on quality of life. However, NP pathogenesis remains unclear. The purpose 
of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and specific 
and meaningful gene targets for the diagnosis and treatment of NP.
METHODS: Data from rat spinal nerve ligations and the sham group were downloaded 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Based on the single-sample gene 
set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method, 29 immune gene sets were identified in 
each sample, and these samples were correlated with the immune infiltration 
phenotype. LASSO regression modeling was used to screen key genes to identify 
diagnostic gene markers. According to GSEA and GSVA, NP is concentrated in a 
large number of immune-related pathways and genes. Additionally, we used the 
DGIdb database and correlation test to construct gene-drug and transcription 
factor interaction networks for differentially expressed genes relevant to 
NP-related ferroptosis. We used WGCNA to identify gene co-expression modules of 
NP, and explored the relationship between gene networks and phenotypes. Finally, 
we crossed core genes with diagnostic markers and analyzed gene correlation with 
molecular subtypes and immune cells.
RESULTS: We identified 224 DEGs, including 191 upregulated genes and 33 
downregulated genes. APC co-stimulation, CCR, cytolytic activity, 
humid-promoting, neutrophils, NK cells, and RGS4, CXCL2, DRD4 and other 7 genes 
related to ferroptosis were involved in NP development. Key genes of RGS4 and 
HIF-1 signaling pathway were screened.
CONCLUSION: This study contributes to our understanding of the neuroimmune 
mechanism of neuropathic pain, provides a reference for NP biomarkers and drug 
targets. Ferroptosis may be the next research direction to explore NP mechanism.

BACKGROUND: Aortic disease (aortic aneurysm (AA), dissection (AD)) is a serious 
threat to patient lives. Little is currently known about the molecular 
mechanisms and immune infiltration patterns underlying the development and 
progression of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms (TAA and AAA), warranting 
further research.
METHODS: We downloaded AA (includes TAA and AAA) datasets from the GEO database. 
The potential biomarkers in TAA and AAA were identified using differential 
expression analysis and two machine-learning algorithms. The discrimination 
power of the potential biomarkers and their diagnostic accuracy was assessed in 
validation datasets using ROC curve analysis. Then, GSEA, KEGG, GO and DO 
analyses were conducted. Furthermore, two immuno-infiltration analysis 
algorithms were utilized to analyze the common immune infiltration patterns in 
TAA and AAA. Finally, a retrospective clinical study was performed on 78 
patients with AD, and the serum from 6 patients was used for whole exome 
sequencing (WES).
RESULTS: The intersection of TAA and AAA datasets yielded 82 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, the biomarkers (CX3CR1 and HBB) were 
acquired by screening using two machine-learning algorithms and ROC curve 
analysis. The functional analysis of DEGs showed significant enrichment in 
inflammation and regulation of angiogenic pathways. Immune cell infiltration 
analysis revealed that adaptive and innate immune responses were closely linked 
to AA progression. However, neither CX3CR1 nor HBB was associated with B 
cell-mediated humoral immunity. CX3CR1 expression was correlated with 
macrophages and HBB with eosinophils. Finally, our retrospective clinical study 
revealed a hyperinflammatory environment in aortic disease. The WES study 
identified disease biomarkers and gene variants, some of which may be druggable.
CONCLUSION: The genes CX3CR1 and HBB can be used as common biomarkers in TAA and 
AAA. Large numbers of innate and adaptive immune cells are infiltrated in AA and 
are closely linked to the development and progression of AA. Moreover, CX3CR1 
and HBB are highly correlated with the infiltration of immune cells and may be 
potential targets of immunotherapeutic drugs. Gene mutation research is a 
promising direction for the treatment of aortic disease.

Endometriosis is a gynecological disease prevalent in women of reproductive age, 
and it is characterized by the ectopic presence and growth of the eutopic 
endometrium. The pathophysiology and diagnostic biomarkers of endometriosis have 
not yet been comprehensively determined. To discover molecular markers and 
pathways underlying the pathogenesis of endometriosis, we identified 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in three Gene Expression Omnibus 
microarray datasets (GSE11691, GSE23339, and GSE7305) and performed gene set 
enrichment analysis (GSEA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
analyses. We also validated the identified genes via immunohistochemical 
analysis of tissues obtained from patients with endometriosis or healthy 
volunteers. A total of 118 DEGs (79 upregulated and 39 downregulated) were 
detected in each dataset with a lower (fold change) FC cutoff (log2|FC| > 1), 
and 17 DEGs (11 upregulated and six downregulated) with a higher FC cutoff 
(log2|FC| > 2). KEGG and GO functional analyses revealed enrichment of signaling 
pathways associated with inflammation, complement activation, cell adhesion, and 
extracellular matrix in endometriotic tissues. Upregulation of seven genes (C7, 
CFH, FZD7, LY96, PDLIM3, PTGIS, and WISP2) out of 17 was validated via 
comparison with external gene sets, and protein expression of four genes (LY96, 
PDLIM3, PTGIS, and WISP2) was further analyzed by immunohistochemistry and 
western blot analysis. Based on these results, we suggest that TLR4/NF-κB and 
Wnt/frizzled signaling pathways, as well as estrogen receptors, regulate the 
progression of endometriosis. These pathways may be therapeutic and diagnostic 
targets for endometriosis.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women 
worldwide. Despite advancements in the clinical application of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NAC), drug resistance remains a major concern hindering treatment 
efficacy. Thus, identifying the key genes involved in driving NAC resistance and 
targeting them with known potential FDA-approved drugs could be applied to 
advance the precision medicine strategy. With this aim, we performed an 
integrative bioinformatics study to identify the key genes associated with NAC 
resistance in breast cancer and then performed the drug repurposing to identify 
the potential drugs which could use in combination with NAC to overcome drug 
resistance. In this study, we used publicly available RNA-seq datasets from the 
samples of breast cancer patients sensitive and resistant to chemotherapy and 
identified a total of 1446 differentially expressed genes in NAC-resistant 
breast cancer patients. Next, we performed gene co-expression network analysis 
to identify significantly co-expressed gene modules, followed by MCC (Multiple 
Correlation Clustering) clustering algorithms and identified 33 key hub genes 
associated with NAC resistance. mRNA-miRNA network analysis highlighted the 
potential impact of these hub genes in altering the regulatory network in 
NAC-resistance breast cancer cells. Further, several hub genes were found to be 
significantly involved in the poor overall survival of breast cancer patients. 
Finally, we identified FDA-approved drugs which could be useful for potential 
drug repurposing against those hub genes. Altogether, our findings provide new 
insight into the molecular mechanisms of NAC resistance and pave the way for 
drug repurposing techniques and personalized treatment to overcome NAC 
resistance in breast cancer.

Reversing HIV-1 latency promotes killing of infected cells and is essential for 
cure strategies; however, no single latency reversing agent (LRA) or LRA 
combination have been shown to reduce HIV-1 latent reservoir size in persons 
living with HIV-1 (PLWH). Here, we describe an approach to systematically 
identify LRA combinations to reactivate latent HIV-1 using genome-wide CRISPR 
screens. Screens on cells treated with suboptimal concentrations of an LRA can 
identify host genes whose knockout enhances viral gene expression. Therefore, 
inhibitors of these genes should synergize with the LRA. We tested this approach 
using AZD5582, an activator of the noncanonical nuclear factor κB (ncNF-κB) 
pathway, as an LRA and identified histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and 
bromodomain-containing protein 2 (BRD2), part of the bromodomain and 
extra-terminal motif (BET) protein family targeted by BET inhibitors, as 
potential targets. Using CD4+ T cells from PLWH, we confirmed synergy between 
AZD5582 and several HDAC inhibitors and between AZD5582 and the BET inhibitor, 
JQ1. A reciprocal screen using suboptimal concentrations of an HDAC inhibitor as 
an LRA identified BRD2 and ncNF-κB regulators, especially BIRC2, as synergistic 
candidates for use in combination with HDAC inhibition. Moreover, we identified 
and validated additional synergistic drug candidates in latency cell line cells 
and primary lymphocytes isolated from PLWH. Specifically, the knockout of genes 
encoding CYLD or YPEL5 displayed synergy with existing LRAs in inducing HIV 
mRNAs. Our study provides insights into the roles of host factors in HIV-1 
reactivation and validates a system for identifying drug combinations for HIV-1 
latency reversal.

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) provides information about routine precision medicine, 
based on the patient's genotype. However, many of the available information 
about human allele frequencies, and about clinical drug-gene interactions, is 
based on American and European populations. PharmaKoVariome database was 
constructed to support genetic testing for safe prescription and drug 
development. It consolidated and stored 2507 diseases, 11 459 drugs and 61 627 
drug-target or druggable genes from public databases. PharmaKoVariome 
precomputed ethnic-specific abundant variants for approximately 120 M 
single-nucleotide variants of drug-target or druggable genes. A user can search 
by gene symbol, drug name, disease and reference SNP ID number (rsID) to 
statistically analyse the frequency of ethnical variations, such as odds ratio 
and P-values for related genes. In an example study, we observed five 
Korean-enriched variants in the CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 genes, one of which 
(rs1065852) is known to be incapable of metabolizing drug. It is also shown that 
4-6% of North and East Asians have risk factors for drugs metabolized by the 
CYP2D6 gene. Therefore, PharmaKoVariome is a useful database for pharmaceutical 
or diagnostic companies for developing diagnostic technologies that can be 
applied in the Asian PGx industry. Database URL:

Differentially expressed genes can serve as drug targets and are used to predict 
drug response and disease progression. In silico drug analysis based on the 
expression of these genetic biomarkers allows the detection of putative 
therapeutic agents, which could be used to reverse a pathological gene 
expression signature. Indeed, a set of bioinformatics tools can increase the 
accuracy of drug discovery, helping in biomarker identification. Once a drug 
target is identified, in vitro cell line models of disease are used to evaluate 
and validate the therapeutic potential of putative drugs and novel natural 
molecules. This study describes the development of efficacious PCR primers that 
can be used to identify gene expression of specific genetic pathways, which can 
lead to the identification of natural molecules as therapeutic agents in 
specific molecular pathways. For this study, genes involved in health conditions 
and processes were considered. In particular, the expression of genes involved 
in obesity, xenobiotics metabolism, endocannabinoid pathway, leukotriene B4 
metabolism and signaling, inflammation, endocytosis, hypoxia, lifespan, and 
neurotrophins were evaluated. Exploiting the expression of specific genes in 
different cell lines can be useful in in vitro to evaluate the therapeutic 
effects of small natural molecules.

Background: Liver cirrhosis is a life-threatening seqsuel of many chronic liver 
disorders of varying etiologies. In this study, we investigated protein targets 
of curcumin in liver cirrhosis based on a bioinformatics approach. Methods: 
Gene/protein associations with curcumin and liver cirrhosis were probed in 
drug−gene and gene−diseases databases including 
STITCH/DGIdb/DisGeNET/OMIM/DISEASES/CTD/Pharos and SwissTargetPrediction. 
Critical clustering groups (MCODE), hub candidates and critical hub genes in 
liver cirrhosis were identified, and connections between curcumin and liver 
cirrhosis-related genes were analyzed via Venn diagram. Interaction of hub genes 
with curcumin by molecular docking using PyRx-virtual screening tools was 
performed. Results: MCODE analysis indicated three MCODEs; the cluster (MCODE 1) 
comprised 79 nodes and 881 edges (score: 22.59). Curcumin database interactions 
recognized 318 protein targets. Liver cirrhosis genes and curcumin protein 
targets analysis demonstrated 96 shared proteins, suggesting that curcumin may 
influence 20 candidate and 13 hub genes, covering 81% of liver cirrhosis 
critical genes and proteins. Thirteen shared proteins affected oxidative stress 
regulation, RNA, telomerase activity, cell proliferation, and cell death. 
Molecular docking analysis showed the affinity of curcumin binding hub genes 
(Binding affinity: ΔG < −4.9 kcal/mol). Conclusions: Curcumin impacted on 
several critical liver cirrhosis genes mainly involved in extracellular matrix 
communication, focal adhesion, and the response to oxidative stress.

(1) Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of 
breast cancer with high intra-tumoral heterogeneity. The epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) is one of the inducers of cancer metastasis and migration. 
However, the description of the EMT process in TNBC using single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) remains unclear. (2) Methods: In this study, we analyzed 
8938 cellular gene expression profiles from five TNBC patients. We first scored 
each malignant cell based on functional pathways to determine its EMT 
characteristics. Then, a pseudo-time trajectory analysis was employed to 
characterize the cell trajectories. Furthermore, CellChat was used to identify 
the cellular communications. (3) Results: We identified 888 epithelium-like and 
846 mesenchyme-like malignant cells, respectively. A further pseudo-time 
trajectory analysis indicated the transition trends from epithelium-like to 
mesenchyme-like in malignant cells. To characterize the potential regulators of 
the EMT process, we identified 10 dysregulated transcription factors (TFs) 
between epithelium-like and mesenchyme-like malignant cells, in which 
overexpressed forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) was recognized as a poor prognosis 
marker of TNBC. Furthermore, we dissected the cell-cell communications via 
ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions. We observed that tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) may support the invasion of malignant epithelial cells, based 
on CXCL-CXCR2 signaling. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway 
secreted by TAMs was identified as an outgoing communication pattern, mediating 
the communications between monocytes/TAMs and malignant epithelial cells. 
Alternatively, the TNF-related ligand-receptor (L-R) pairs showed promising 
clinical implications. Some immunotherapy and anti-neoplastic drugs could 
interact with the L-R pairs as a potential strategy for the treatment of TNBC. 
In summary, this study enhances the understanding of the EMT process in the TNBC 
microenvironment, and dissections of EMT-related cell communications also 
provided us with potential treatment targets.

The pharmacological mechanism of curcumin against drug resistance in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This study aims to summarize the genes 
and pathways associated with curcumin action as an adjuvant therapy in NSCLC 
using network pharmacology, drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics, functional 
enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, and molecular docking. 
Prognostic genes were identified from the curcumin-NSCLC intersection gene set 
for the following drug sensitivity analysis. Immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and 
targeted therapy sensitivity analyses were performed using external cohorts 
(GSE126044 and IMvigor210) and the CellMiner database. 94 curcumin-lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) hub targets and 41 curcumin-lung squamous cell carcinoma 
(LUSC) hub targets were identified as prognostic genes. The anticancer effect of 
curcumin was observed in KEGG pathways involved with lung cancer, cancer 
therapy, and other cancers. Among the prognostic curcumin-NSCLC intersection 
genes, 20 LUAD and 8 LUSC genes were correlated with immunotherapy sensitivity 
in the GSE126044 NSCLC cohort; 30 LUAD and 13 LUSC genes were associated with 
immunotherapy sensitivity in the IMvigor210 cohort; and 12 LUAD and 13 LUSC 
genes were related to chemosensitivity in the CellMiner database. Moreover, 3 
LUAD and 5 LUSC genes were involved in the response to targeted therapy in the 
CellMiner database. Curcumin regulates drug sensitivity in NSCLC by interacting 
with cell cycle, NF-kappa B, MAPK, Th17 cell differentiation signaling pathways, 
etc. Curcumin in combination with immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted drugs 
has the potential to be effective for drug-resistant NSCLC. The findings of our 
study reveal the relevant key signaling pathways and targets of curcumin as an 
adjuvant therapy in the treatment of NSCLC, thus providing pharmacological 
evidence for further experimental research.

BACKGROUND: Although increasing evidence has reported an increased risk of 
atherosclerosis (AS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the communal molecular 
mechanism of this phenomenon is still far from being fully elucidated. Hence, 
this article aimed to explore the pathogenesis of RA complicated with AS.
METHODS: Based on the strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, four gene datasets 
were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After 
identifying the communal differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hub genes, 
comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, including functional annotation, 
co-expression analysis, expression validation, drug-gene prediction, and 
TF-mRNA-miRNA regulatory network construction, was conducted. Moreover, the 
immune infiltration of RA and AS was analyzed and compared based on the 
CIBERSORT algorithm, and the correlation between hub genes and infiltrating 
immune cells was evaluated in RA and AS respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 54 upregulated and 12 downregulated communal DEGs were 
screened between GSE100927 and GSE55457, and functional analysis of these genes 
indicated that the potential pathogenesis lies in immune terms. After the 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, a total of six hub genes 
(CCR5, CCR7, IL7R, PTPRC, CD2, and CD3D) were determined as hub genes, and the 
subsequent comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the hub genes re-emphasized 
the importance of the immune system in RA and AS. Additionally, three 
overlapping infiltrating immune cells were found between RA and AS based on the 
CIBERSORT algorithm, including upregulated memory B cells, follicular helper T 
cells and γδT cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncover the communal central genes and commonness in 
immune infiltration between RA and AS, and the analysis of six hub genes and 
three immune cells profile might provide new insights into potential 
pathogenesis therapeutic direction of RA complicated with AS.

Complex diseases are associated with a wide range of cellular, physiological, 
and clinical phenotypes. To advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and 
our ability to treat these diseases, it is critical to delineate the molecular 
basis and therapeutic avenues of specific disease phenotypes, especially those 
that are associated with multiple diseases. Inflammatory processes constitute 
one such prominent phenotype, being involved in a wide range of health problems 
including ischemic heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic 
kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and autoimmune and 
neurodegenerative conditions. While hundreds of genes might play a role in the 
etiology of each of these diseases, isolating the genes involved in the specific 
phenotype (e.g., inflammation "component") could help us understand the genes 
and pathways underlying this phenotype across diseases and predict potential 
drugs to target the phenotype. Here, we present a computational approach that 
integrates gene interaction networks, disease-/trait-gene associations, and 
drug-target information to accomplish this goal. We apply this approach to 
isolate gene signatures of complex diseases that correspond to chronic 
inflammation and use SAveRUNNER to prioritize drugs to reveal new therapeutic 
opportunities.

PURPOSE: Psoriasis is closely linked to ferroptosis. This study aimed to 
identify potential ferroptosis-associated genes in psoriasis using 
bioinformatics.
METHODS: Data from the GSE30999 dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO), and the ferroptosis-associated genes were retrieved from FerrDb. 
The differentially expressed ferroptosis-associated genes were identified using 
Venn diagrams. Subsequently, a network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) 
between psoriasis targets and ferroptosis-associated genes was constructed based 
on the STRING database and analyzed by Cytoscape software. The Metascape portal 
conducted Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathway enrichment analyses. Moreover, the expression of ferroptosis-related 
genes was verified in the GSE13355 dataset. Finally, the verified genes were 
used to predict the therapeutic drugs for psoriasis using the DGIdb/CMap 
database. SwissDock was used to examine ligand docking, and UCSF Chimera 
displayed the results visually.
RESULTS: Among 85 pairs of psoriasis lesion (LS) and no-lesion (NL) samples from 
patients, 19 ferroptosis-associated genes were found to be differentially 
expressed (3 upregulated genes and 16 downregulated genes). Based on the PPI 
results, these ferroptosis-associated genes interact with each other. The GO and 
KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes 
indicated several enriched terms related to the oxidative stress response. The 
GSE13355 dataset verified the results of the bioinformatics analysis obtained 
from the GSE30999 dataset regarding SLC7A5, SLC7A11, and CHAC1. 
Psoriasis-related compounds corresponding to SLC7A5 and SLC7A11 were also 
identified, including Melphalan, Quisqualate, Riluzole, and Sulfasalazine.
CONCLUSION: We identified 3 differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes 
through bioinformatics analysis. SLC7A5, SLC7A11, and CHAC1 may affect the 
development of psoriasis by regulating ferroptosis. These results open new 
avenues in understanding the treatment of psoriasis.

BACKGROUND: Geriatric people are prone to suffer from multiple chronic diseases, 
which can directly or indirectly affect renal function. Through bioinformatics 
analysis, this study aimed to identify key genes and pathways associated with 
renal insufficiency in patients with geriatric multimorbidity and explore 
potential drugs against renal insufficiency.
METHODS: The text mining tool Pubmed2Ensembl was used to detect genes associated 
with the keywords including "Geriatric", "Multimorbidity" and "Renal 
insufficiency". The GeneCodis program was used to specify Gene Ontology (GO) 
biological process terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using 
STRING and visualized in Cytoscape. Module analysis was performed using 
CytoHubba and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plugins. GO and KEGG analysis 
of gene modules was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization 
and Integrated Discover (DAVID) platform database. Genes clustered in salient 
modules were selected as core genes. Then, the functions and pathways of core 
genes were visualized using ClueGO and CluePedia. Finally, the drug-gene 
interaction database was used to explore drug-gene interactions of the core 
genes to identify drug candidates for renal insufficiency in patients with 
geriatric multimorbidity.
RESULTS: Through text mining, 351 genes associated with "Geriatric", 
"Multimorbidity" and "Renal insufficiency" were identified. A PPI network 
consisting of 216 nodes and 1087 edges was constructed and CytoHubba was used to 
sequence the genes. Five gene modules were obtained by MCODE analysis. The 26 
genes clustered in module1 were selected as core candidate genes primarily 
associated with renal insufficiency in patients with geriatric multimorbidity. 
The HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, Rap1, and FoxO signaling pathways were enriched. We 
found that 21 of the 26 selected genes could be targeted by 34 existing drugs.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that CST3, SERPINA1, FN1, PF4, IGF1, KNG1, IL6, 
VEGFA, ALB, TIMP1, TGFB1, HGF, SERPINE1, APOA1, APOB, FGF23, EGF, APOE, VWF, TF, 
CP, GAS6, APP, IGFBP3, P4HB, and SPP1 were key genes potentially involved with 
renal insufficiency in patients with geriatric multimorbidity. In addition, 34 
drugs were identified as potential agents for the treatment and management of 
renal insufficiency.

Opioid addiction (OA) is moderately heritable, yet only rs1799971, the A118G 
variant in OPRM1, has been identified as a genome-wide significant association 
with OA and independently replicated. We applied genomic structural equation 
modeling to conduct a GWAS of the new Genetics of Opioid Addiction Consortium 
(GENOA) data together with published studies (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 
Million Veteran Program, and Partners Health), comprising 23,367 cases and 
effective sample size of 88,114 individuals of European ancestry. Genetic 
correlations among the various OA phenotypes were uniformly high (rg > 0.9). We 
observed the strongest evidence to date for OPRM1: lead SNP rs9478500 
(p = 2.56 × 10-9). Gene-based analyses identified novel genome-wide significant 
associations with PPP6C and FURIN. Variants within these loci appear to be 
pleiotropic for addiction and related traits.

BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia (VaD) and carotid atherosclerotic plaques are 
common in the elderly population, conferring a heavy burden on families and 
society. Accumulating evidence indicates carotid atherosclerotic plaques to be a 
risk factor for VaD. However, the underlying mechanisms for this association are 
mainly unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed temporal cortex gene expression data of the 
GSE122063 dataset and gene expression data of the GSE163154 dataset to identify 
commonly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then we performed functional 
enrichment analysis, immune cell infiltration and evaluation, correlation 
analysis between differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs) and 
immune cells, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and drug-gene 
analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 41 overlapped DEGs between the VaD and carotid 
atherosclerosis plaque datasets. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that 
these overlapped DEGs were mainly enriched in inflammatory and immune-related 
processes. Immunocyte infiltration and evaluation results showed that M0 
macrophages, M2 macrophages, and T cells gamma delta had a dominant abundance in 
carotid atherosclerosis plaque samples, and M0 macrophages showed a 
significantly different infiltration percentage between the early and advanced 
stage plaques group. Resting CD4 memory T cells, M2 macrophages, and naive B 
cells were the top three highest infiltrating fractions in VaD. Furthermore, B 
cells and NK cells showed a different infiltration percentage between VaD and 
matched controls. We identified 12 DEIRGs, and the result of correlation 
analysis revealed that these DEIRGs were closely related to differentially 
expressed immune cells. We identified five key DEIRGs based on ROC analysis. The 
drug-gene interaction analysis showed that four drugs (avacopan, CCX354, 
BMS-817399, and ASK-8007) could be potential drugs for VaD and carotid 
atherosclerotic plaques treatment.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings indicated that inflammatory and 
immune-related processes be a crucial common pathophysiological mechanism shared 
by VaD and carotid plaques. This study might provide new insights into common 
molecular mechanisms between VaD and carotid plaques and potential targets for 
the treatment.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor cell-derived DNA/RNA to screen for 
targetable genomic alterations is now widely available and has become part of 
routine practice in oncology. NGS testing strategies depend on cancer type, 
disease stage and the impact of results on treatment selection. The European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has recently published recommendations for 
the use of NGS in patients with advanced cancer. We complement the ESMO 
recommendations with a practical review of how oncologists should read and 
interpret NGS reports. A concise and straightforward NGS report contains details 
of the tumor sample, the technology used and highlights not only the most 
important and potentially actionable results, but also other pathogenic 
alterations detected. Variants of unknown significance should also be listed. 
Interpretation of NGS reports should be a joint effort between molecular 
pathologists, tumor biologists and clinicians. Rather than relying and acting on 
the information provided by the NGS report, oncologists need to obtain a basic 
level of understanding to read and interpret NGS results. Comprehensive 
annotated databases are available for clinicians to review the information 
detailed in the NGS report. Molecular tumor boards do not only stimulate debate 
and exchange, but may also help to interpret challenging reports and to ensure 
continuing medical education.

Despite an estimated heritability of ~50%, genome-wide association studies of 
opioid use disorder (OUD) have revealed few genome-wide significant loci. We 
conducted a cross-ancestry meta-analysis of OUD in the Million Veteran Program 
(N = 425,944). In addition to known exonic variants in OPRM1 and FURIN, we 
identified intronic variants in RABEPK, FBXW4, NCAM1 and KCNN1. A meta-analysis 
including other datasets identified a locus in TSNARE1. In total, we identified 
14 loci for OUD, 12 of which are novel. Significant genetic correlations were 
identified for 127 traits, including psychiatric disorders and other substance 
use-related traits. The only significantly enriched cell-type group was CNS, 
with gene expression enrichment in brain regions previously associated with 
substance use disorders. These findings increase our understanding of the 
biological basis of OUD and provide further evidence that it is a brain disease, 
which may help to reduce stigma and inform efforts to address the opioid 
epidemic.

BACKGROUND: Up to 80% of patients surviving acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection present persistent anomalies in 
pulmonary function after hospital discharge. There is a limited understanding of 
the mechanistic pathways linked to post-acute pulmonary sequelae.
AIM: To identify the molecular underpinnings associated with severe lung 
diffusion involvement in survivors of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS.
METHODS: Survivors attended to a complete pulmonary evaluation 3 months after 
hospital discharge. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed using Illumina 
technology in whole-blood samples from 50 patients with moderate to severe 
diffusion impairment (DLCO<60%) and age- and sex-matched individuals with 
mild-normal lung function (DLCO≥60%). A transcriptomic signature for optimal 
classification was constructed using random forest. Transcriptomic data were 
analyzed for biological pathway enrichment, cellular deconvolution, 
cell/tissue-specific gene expression and candidate drugs.
RESULTS: RNA-seq identified 1357 differentially expressed transcripts. A model 
composed of 14 mRNAs allowed the optimal discrimination of survivors with severe 
diffusion impairment (AUC=0.979). Hallmarks of lung sequelae involved cell death 
signaling, cytoskeleton reorganization, cell growth and differentiation and the 
immune response. Resting natural killer (NK) cells were the most important 
immune cell subtype for the prediction of severe diffusion impairment. 
Components of the signature correlated with neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte 
counts. A variable expression profile of the transcripts was observed in lung 
cell subtypes and bodily tissues. One upregulated gene, TUBB4A, constitutes a 
target for FDA-approved drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: This work defines the transcriptional programme associated with 
post-acute pulmonary sequelae and provides novel insights for targeted 
interventions and biomarker development.

Numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate the relation of tumor 
proximity to cancer prognosis and treatment efficacy in colorectal cancer. 
However, the molecular pathways and prognoses of left- and right-sided 
colorectal cancers are different, and this difference has not been fully 
investigated at the genomic level. In this study, a set of data science 
approaches, including six feature selection methods and three classification 
models, were used in predicting tumor location from gene expression profiles. 
Specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) 
evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the classification ability. Gene 
ontology enrichment analysis was applied by the Gene Ontology PANTHER 
Classification System. For the most significant 50 genes, protein-protein 
interactions and drug-gene interactions were analyzed using the GeneMANIA, 
CytoScape, CytoHubba, MCODE, and DGIdb databases. The highest classification 
accuracy (90%) is achieved with the most significant 200 genes when the 
ensemble-decision tree classification model is used with the ReliefF feature 
selection method. Molecular pathways and drug interactions are investigated for 
the most significant 50 genes. It is concluded that a machine-learning-based 
approach could be useful to discover the significant genes that may have an 
important role in the development of new therapies and drugs for colorectal 
cancer.

At present, most patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are in the 
middle or advanced stages at the time of diagnosis. Advanced OSCC patients have 
a poor prognosis after traditional therapy, and the complex heterogeneity of 
OSCC has been proven to be one of the main reasons. Single-cell sequencing 
technology provides a powerful tool for dissecting the heterogeneity of cancer. 
However, most of the current studies at the single-cell level are static, while 
the development of cancer is a dynamic process. Thus, understanding the 
development of cancer from a dynamic perspective and formulating corresponding 
therapeutic measures for achieving precise treatment are highly necessary, and 
this is also one of the main study directions in the field of oncology. In this 
study, we combined the static and dynamic analysis methods based on single-cell 
RNA-Seq data to comprehensively dissect the complex heterogeneity and 
evolutionary process of OSCC. Subsequently, for clinical practice, we revealed 
the association between cancer heterogeneity and the prognosis of patients. More 
importantly, we pioneered the concept of pseudo-time score of patients, and we 
quantified the levels of heterogeneity based on the dynamic development process 
to evaluate the relationship between the score and the survival status at the 
same stage, finding that it is closely related to the prognostic status. The 
pseudo-time score of patients could not only reflect the tumor status of 
patients but also be used as an indicator of the effects of drugs on the 
patients so that the medication strategy can be adjusted on time. Finally, we 
identified candidate drugs and proposed precision medication strategies to 
control the condition of OSCC in two respects: treatment and blocking.

PURPOSE: There is a bidirectional relationship between periodontitis and type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to further explore the 
pathogenesis of this comorbidity, screen out ferroptosis-related genes involved 
in the pathological process, and predict potential drug targets to develop new 
therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: Common cross-talk genes were identified from periodontitis datasets 
(GSE16134, GSE10334 and GSE106090) and T2DM databases (DisGeNET and GeneCard). 
Then, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, PPI network analysis and hub gene 
identification were performed. The association between ferroptosis and 
periodontitis with T2DM was investigated by Pearson correlation analysis. Core 
ferroptosis-related cross-talk genes were identified and verified by qRT-PCR. 
Potential drugs targeting these core genes were predicted via DGIDB.
RESULTS: In total, 67 cross-talk genes and two main signalling pathways 
(immuno-inflammatory pathway and AGE-RAGE signalling pathway) were identified. 
Pearson correlation analysis indicated that ferroptosis served as a crucial 
target in the pathological mechanism and treatment of periodontitis with T2DM. 
IL-1β, IL-6, NFE2L2 and ALOX5 were identified as core ferroptosis-related genes 
and the qRT-PCR detection results were statistically different. In total, 13 
potential drugs were screened out, among which, Echinacea and Ibudilast should 
be developed first.
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the common 
pathogenesis of periodontitis and T2DM and provides new insights into the role 
of ferroptosis in this comorbidity. In addition, two drugs with potential 
clinical application value were identified. The potential utility of these drugs 
requires further experimental investigation.

Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe clinical syndrome, and 
ischemia-reperfusion injury is an important cause of acute kidney injury. The 
aim of the present study was to investigate the related genes and pathways in 
the mouse model of acute kidney injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury 
(IRI-AKI). Method: Two public datasets (GSE39548 and GSE131288) originating from 
the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were analyzed using the R 
software limma package, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
identified. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genomes (KEGG) and gene 
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed using the differentially expressed 
genes. Furthermore, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed 
to investigate hub genes, and transcription factor (TF)-hub gene and miRNA-hub 
gene networks were constructed. Drugs and molecular compounds that could 
interact with hub genes were predicted using the DGIdb. Result: A total of 323 
common differentially expressed genes were identified in the renal 
ischemia-reperfusion injury group compared with the control group. Among these, 
260 differentially expressed genes were upregulated and 66 differentially 
expressed genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis results showed that these common 
differentially expressed genes were enriched in positive regulation of cytokine 
production, muscle tissue development, and other biological processes, 
indicating that they were involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), 
PI3K-Akt, TNF, apoptosis, and Epstein-Barr virus infection signaling pathways. 
Protein-protein interaction analysis showed 10 hub genes, namely, Jun, Stat3, 
MYC, Cdkn1a, Hif1a, FOS, Atf3, Mdm2, Egr1, and Ddit3. Using the STRUST database, 
starBase database, and DGIdb database, it was predicted that 34 transcription 
factors, 161 mi-RNAs, and 299 drugs or molecular compounds might interact with 
hub genes. Conclusion: Our findings may provide novel potential biomarkers and 
insights into the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury-acute kidney 
injury through a comprehensive analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus data, which 
may provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment of 
ischemia-reperfusion injury-acute kidney injury.

(1) Background: Phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are characteristic 
features of cancer patients. To tackle patients' heterogeneity, immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) represent some the most promising therapeutic 
approaches. However, approximately 50% of cancer patients that are eligible for 
treatment with ICIs do not respond well, especially patients with no targetable 
mutations. Over the years, multiple patient stratification techniques have been 
developed to identify homogenous patient subgroups, although matching a patient 
subgroup to a treatment option that can improve patients' health outcomes 
remains a challenging task. (2) Methods: We extended our Subgroup Discovery 
algorithm to identify patient subpopulations that could potentially benefit from 
immuno-targeted combination therapies in four cancer types: head and neck 
squamous carcinoma (HNSC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous carcinoma 
(LUSC), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). We employed the proportional odds 
model to identify significant drug targets and the corresponding compounds that 
increased the likelihood of stable disease versus progressive disease in cancer 
patients with the EGFR wild-type (WT) gene. (3) Results: Our pipeline identified 
six significant drug targets and thirteen specific compounds for cancer patients 
with the EGFR WT gene. Three out of six drug targets-FCGR2B, IGF1R, and 
KIT-substantially increased the odds of having stable disease versus progressive 
disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) of more than 6 months was a common 
feature among the investigated subgroups. (4) Conclusions: Our approach could 
help to better select responders for immuno-targeted combination therapies and 
improve health outcomes for cancer patients with no targetable mutations.

BACKGROUND: Biomedical translational science is increasingly using computational 
reasoning on repositories of structured knowledge (such as UMLS, SemMedDB, 
ChEMBL, Reactome, DrugBank, and SMPDB in order to facilitate discovery of new 
therapeutic targets and modalities. The NCATS Biomedical Data Translator project 
is working to federate autonomous reasoning agents and knowledge providers 
within a distributed system for answering translational questions. Within that 
project and the broader field, there is a need for a framework that can 
efficiently and reproducibly build an integrated, standards-compliant, and 
comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph that can be downloaded in standard 
serialized form or queried via a public application programming interface (API).
RESULTS: To create a knowledge provider system within the Translator project, we 
have developed RTX-KG2, an open-source software system for building-and hosting 
a web API for querying-a biomedical knowledge graph that uses an 
Extract-Transform-Load approach to integrate 70 knowledge sources (including the 
aforementioned core six sources) into a knowledge graph with provenance 
information including (where available) citations. The semantic layer and schema 
for RTX-KG2 follow the standard Biolink model to maximize interoperability. 
RTX-KG2 is currently being used by multiple Translator reasoning agents, both in 
its downloadable form and via its SmartAPI-registered interface. Serializations 
of RTX-KG2 are available for download in both the pre-canonicalized form and in 
canonicalized form (in which synonyms are merged). The current canonicalized 
version (KG2.7.3) of RTX-KG2 contains 6.4M nodes and 39.3M edges with a 
hierarchy of 77 relationship types from Biolink.
CONCLUSION: RTX-KG2 is the first knowledge graph that integrates UMLS, SemMedDB, 
ChEMBL, DrugBank, Reactome, SMPDB, and 64 additional knowledge sources within a 
knowledge graph that conforms to the Biolink standard for its semantic layer and 
schema. RTX-KG2 is publicly available for querying via its API at 
arax.rtx.ai/api/rtxkg2/v1.2/openapi.json . The code to build RTX-KG2 is publicly 
available at github:RTXteam/RTX-KG2 .

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder caused by 
pathogenic variants in TSC1 and TSC2 genes. TSC patients present with seizures 
and brain abnormalities such as tubers and subependymal giant cells astrocytoma 
(SEGA). Despite common molecular and clinical features, the severity of the 
disease varies greatly, even intrafamilially. The second hit hypothesis suggests 
that an additional, inactivating mutation in the remaining functional allele 
causes a more severe phenotype and therefore explains the phenotypic 
variability. Recently, second hit mutations have been detected frequently in 
mTORopathies. To investigate the pathophysiological effects of second hit 
mutations, several mouse models have been developed. Here, we opted for a double 
mutant zebrafish model that carries a LOF mutation both in the tsc2 and the 
depdc5 gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a second-hit 
model has been studied in zebrafish. Significantly, the DEP domain-containing 
protein 5 (DEPDC5) gene has an important role in the regulation of mTORC1, and 
the combination of a germline TSC2 and somatic DEPDC5 mutation has been 
described in a TSC patient with intractable epilepsy. Our depdc5 -/- x tsc2 -/- 
double mutant zebrafish line displayed greatly increased levels of mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTORC1) activity, augmented seizure susceptibility, and 
early lethality which could be rescued by rapamycin. Histological analysis of 
the brain revealed ventricular dilatation in the tsc2 and double homozygotes. 
RNA-sequencing showed a linear relation between the number of differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) and the degree of mTORC1 hyperactivity. Enrichment 
analysis of their transcriptomes revealed that many genes associated with 
neurological developmental processes were downregulated and mitochondrial genes 
were upregulated. In particular, the transcriptome of human SEGA lesions 
overlapped strongly with the double homozygous zebrafish larvae. The data 
highlight the clinical relevance of the depdc5 -/- x tsc2 -/- double mutant 
zebrafish larvae that showed a more severe phenotype compared to the single 
mutants. Finally, analysis of gene-drug interactions identified interesting 
pharmacological targets for SEGA, underscoring the value of our small zebrafish 
vertebrate model for future drug discovery efforts.

Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a common and serious neurological disease, 
and multiple pathways of cell apoptosis are implicated in its pathogenesis. 
Recently, extensive studies have indicated that pyroptosis is involved in 
various diseases, especially cerebrovascular diseases. However, the exact 
mechanism of interaction between pyroptosis and IS is scarcely understood. Thus, 
we aimed to investigate the impact of pyroptosis on IS-mediated systemic 
inflammation. Methods: First, the RNA regulation patterns mediated by 33 
pyroptosis-related genes identified in 20 IS samples and 20 matched-control 
samples were systematically evaluated. Second, a series of bioinformatics 
algorithms were used to investigate the contribution of PRGs to IS pathogenesis. 
We determined three composition classifiers of PRGs which potentially 
distinguished healthy samples from IS samples according to the risk score using 
single-variable logistic regression, LASSO-Cox regression, and multivariable 
logistic regression analyses. Third, 20 IS patients were classified by 
unsupervised consistent cluster analysis in relation to pyroptosis. The 
association between pyroptosis and systemic inflammation characteristics was 
explored, which was inclusive of immune reaction gene sets, infiltrating 
immunocytes and human leukocyte antigen genes. Results: We identified that AIM2, 
SCAF11, and TNF can regulate immuno-inflammatory responses after strokes via the 
production of inflammatory factors and activation of the immune cells. 
Meanwhile, we identified distinct expression patterns mediated by pyroptosis and 
revealed their immune characteristics, differentially expressed genes, signaling 
pathways, and target drugs. Conclusion: Our findings lay a foundation for 
further research on pyroptosis and IS systemic inflammation, to improve IS 
prognosis and its responses to immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are of increasing interest in the 
study of psoriasis mechanisms. This study aims to screen potential diagnostic 
indicators affected by DNA methylation for psoriasis based on bioinformatics 
using multiple machine learning algorithms and to preliminarily explore its 
molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: GSE13355, GSE14905, and GSE73894 were collected from the gene 
expression omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 
differentially methylated region- (DMR-) genes between psoriasis and control 
samples were combined to obtain differentially expressed methylated genes. 
Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established to 
analyze the interaction between differentially expressed methylated genes. 
Moreover, the hub genes of psoriasis were screened by the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector 
Machine (SVM), which were further performed single-gene gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA) to clarify the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The druggable genes 
were predicted using DGIdb. Finally, the expressions of hub genes in psoriasis 
lesions and healthy controls were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 
quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR).
RESULTS: In this study, a total of 767 DEGs and 896 DMR-genes were obtained. 
Functional enrichment showed that they were significantly associated with skin 
development, skin barrier function, immune/inflammatory response, and cell 
cycle. The combined transcriptomic and DNA methylation data resulted in 33 
differentially expressed methylated genes, of which GJB2 was the final 
identified hub gene for psoriasis, with robust diagnostic power. IHC and RT-qPCR 
showed that GJB2 was significantly higher in psoriasis samples than those in 
healthy controls. Additionally, GJB2 may be involved in the development and 
progression of psoriasis by disrupting the body's immune system, mediating the 
cell cycle, and destroying the skin barrier, in addition to possibly inducing 
diseases related to the skeletal aspects of psoriasis. Moreover, OCTANOL and 
CARBENOXOLONE were identified as promising compounds through the DGIdb database.
CONCLUSION: The abnormal expression of GJB2 might play a critical role in 
psoriasis development and progression. The genes identified in our study might 
serve as a diagnostic indicator and therapeutic target in psoriasis.

BACKGROUND: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a disabling orthopedic 
disease, which is impacted by infiltration of immune cells. Thus, the aim of the 
current research was to determine the inflammation-related biomarkers in ONFH.
METHODS: GSE123568 dataset with control and steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the 
femoral head (SONFH) samples were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected by limma R 
package and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to 
explore the co-expression genes and modules. We obtained inflammation-related 
genes (IRGs) from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Then, the IRGs 
associated with SONFH (IRGs-SONFH) were screened out and analyzed by Gene 
Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. A 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established using the Search Tool 
for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database, and hub genes 
were identified by the MCODE algorithm. Based on the hub genes, we constructed a 
lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network.
RESULTS: We identified 535 DEGs between control and SONFH samples. The WGCNA 
clearly indicated that the brown module was most significantly associated with 
SONFH. We identified 25 IRGs-SONFH through WGCNA module genes, DEGs and IRGs. A 
total of 4 hub genes (CD14, CYBB, NOD2, and TLR1) were identified by Cytoscape. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined that the 
expressions of the four genes could distinguish SONFH from controls as evidenced 
by the area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.7. Finally, we constructed a 
competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network which included 67 lncRNAs, 1 miRNA 
(hsa-miR-320a), and 1 mRNA (NOD2).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified 4 hub genes as potential inflammation-related 
biomarkers of SONFH. Moreover, we proposed a ceRNA network of lncRNAs targeting 
hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-320a, and NOD2 as a potential RNA regulatory pathway that 
controls disease progression in ONFH.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified many genetic loci 
that are robustly associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the 
underlying biological mechanisms are still unknown for most of these loci, 
hindering the progress to medical translation. Evidence suggests that the 
genetic influence on CAD susceptibility may act partly through vascular smooth 
muscle cells (VSMCs).
METHODS: We undertook genotyping, RNA sequencing, and cell behavior assays on a 
large bank of VSMCs (n>1499). Expression quantitative trait locus and splicing 
quantitative trait locus analyses were performed to identify genes with an 
expression that was influenced by CAD-associated variants. To identify candidate 
causal genes for CAD, we ascertained colocalizations of VSMC expression 
quantitative trait locus signals with CAD association signals by performing 
causal variants identification in associated regions analysis and the summary 
data-based mendelian randomization test. Druggability analysis was then 
performed on the candidate causal genes. CAD risk variants were tested for 
associations with VSMC proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Collective 
effects of multiple CAD-associated variants on VSMC behavior were estimated by 
polygenic scores.
RESULTS: Approximately 60% of the known CAD-associated variants showed 
statistically significant expression quantitative trait locus or splicing 
quantitative trait locus effects in VSMCs. Colocalization analyses identified 84 
genes with expression quantitative trait locus signals that significantly 
colocalized with CAD association signals, identifying them as candidate causal 
genes. Druggability analysis indicated that 38 of the candidate causal genes 
were druggable, and 13 had evidence of drug-gene interactions. Of the 
CAD-associated variants tested, 139 showed suggestive associations with VSMC 
proliferation, migration, or apoptosis. A polygenic score model explained up to 
5.94% of variation in several VSMC behavior parameters, consistent with 
polygenic influences on VSMC behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis shows that a large percentage of CAD 
loci can modulate gene expression in VSMCs and influence VSMC behavior. Several 
candidate causal genes identified are likely to be druggable and thus represent 
potential therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the leading cause of 
death in patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC). However, the unclear 
pathogenesis of cSCC limits the application of molecular targeted therapy.
METHODS: Three microarray datasets (GSE2503, GSE45164, and GSE66359) were 
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). After identifying the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumor and nontumor tissues, five kinds 
of analyses, namely, functional annotation, protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network, hub gene selection, TF-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network analysis, and 
ferroptosis mechanism, were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 146 DEGs were identified with significant differences, 
including 113 upregulated genes and 33 downregulated genes. The enriched 
functions and pathways of the DEGs included microtubule-based movement, ATP 
binding, cell cycle, P53 signaling pathway, oocyte meiosis, and PLK1 signaling 
events. Nine hub genes were identified (CDK1, AURKA, RRM2, CENPE, CCNB1, 
KIAA0101, ZWINT, TOP2A, and ASPM). Finally, RRM2, AURKA, and SAT1 were 
identified as significant ferroptosis-related genes in cSCC. The differential 
expression of these genes has been verified in two other independent datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: By integrated bioinformatic analysis, the hub genes identified in 
this study elucidated the molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis and 
progression of cSCC and are expected to become future biomarkers or therapeutic 
targets.

Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that seriously 
affects the quality of people. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of OA has not 
been fully known. Therefore, this study aimed to construct a ceRNA regulatory 
network related to OA to explore the pathogenesis of OA. Methods: Differentially 
expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs), microRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were 
obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus microarray data (GSE175959, GSE105027, 
and GSE169077). The miRNA response elements and target mRNAs were identified 
using bioinformatics approaches. Additionally, a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was 
established using Cytoscape version 3.8.0. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of mRNAs in the network were 
conducted to explore the possible mechanisms underlying OA development. 
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed to determine the hub 
genes. Based on the hub genes, a sub network was constructed using Cytoscape 
3.8.0 version. Finally, connectivity map (CMap) and drug-gene interaction 
database (DGIdb) analyses were performed to identify the potential therapeutic 
targets for OA. Results: Altogether, five DEcircRNAs, 89 DEmiRNAs, and 345 
DEmRNAs were identified. Moreover, a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was established 
using three circRNAs, seven miRNAs, and 37 mRNAs. GO and KEGG analyses 
demonstrated that the mRNAs in the network could be related to the occurrence 
and development of OA. PPI analysis was performed and six key genes, namely 
serpin family H member 1 [SERPINH1], collagen type VIII alpha 2 chain [COL8A2], 
collagen type XV alpha 1 chain [COL15A1], collagen type VI alpha 3 chain 
[COL6A3], collagen type V alpha 1 chain [COL5A1], and collagen type XI alpha 1 
chain [COL11A1], were identified. Furthermore, a circRNA-miRNA-hub gene 
subnetwork was established in accordance with two circRNAs (hsa_circ_0075320 and 
hsa_circ_0051428), two miRNAs (hsa-miR-6124 and hsa-miR-1207-5p), and six hub 
genes (COL11A1, SERPINH1, COL6A3, COL5A1, COL8A2, and COL15A1). Finally, three 
chemicals (noscapine, diazepam, and TG100-115) based on CMap analysis and two 
drugs (collagenase Clostridium histolyticum and ocriplasmin) based on DGIdb were 
discovered as potential treatment options for OA. Conclusion: This study 
presents novel perspectives on the pathogenesis and treatment of OA based on 
circRNA-related competitive endogenous RNA regulatory networks.

We carried out a genome-wide association analysis including 51,194 cases of 
hypothyroidism and 443,383 controls. In total, 139 risk loci were associated to 
hypothyroidism with genes involved in lymphocyte function. Candidate genes 
associated with hypothyroidism were identified by using molecular quantitative 
trait loci, colocalization, and enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. Mendelian 
randomization (MR) identified 42 blood expressed genes and circulating proteins 
as candidate causal molecules in hypothyroidism. Drug-gene interaction analysis 
provided evidence that immune checkpoint and tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in 
cancer therapy increase the risk of hypothyroidism. Hence, integrative mapping 
and MR support that expression of genes and proteins enriched in lymphocyte 
function are associated with the risk of hypothyroidism and provide genetic 
evidence for drug-induced hypothyroidism and identify actionable potential drug 
targets.

Most disease-gene association methods do not account for gene-gene interactions, 
even though these play a crucial role in complex, polygenic diseases like 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). To discover new genes whose interactions may 
contribute to pathology, we introduce GeneEMBED. This approach compares the 
functional perturbations induced in gene interaction network neighborhoods by 
coding variants from disease versus healthy subjects. In two independent AD 
cohorts of 5,169 exomes and 969 genomes, GeneEMBED identified novel candidates. 
These genes were differentially expressed in post mortem AD brains and modulated 
neurological phenotypes in mice. Four that were differentially overexpressed and 
modified neurodegeneration in vivo are PLEC, UTRN, TP53, and POLD1. Notably, 
TP53 and POLD1 are involved in DNA break repair and inhibited by approved drugs. 
While these data show proof of concept in AD, GeneEMBED is a general approach 
that should be broadly applicable to identify genes relevant to risk mechanisms 
and therapy of other complex diseases.

Genome-wide CRISPR screens have been extremely useful in identifying therapeutic 
targets in diverse cancers by defining genes that are essential for malignant 
growth. However, most CRISPR screens were performed in vitro and thus cannot 
identify genes that are essential for interactions with the microenvironment 
in vivo. Here, we report genome-wide CRISPR screens in 2 in vivo murine models 
of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driven by the KMT2A/MLLT3 fusion or by the 
constitutive coexpression of Hoxa9 and Meis1. Secondary validation using a 
focused library identified 72 genes specifically essential for leukemic growth 
in vivo, including components of the major histocompatibility complex class I 
complex, Cd47, complement receptor Cr1l, and the β-4-galactosylation pathway. 
Importantly, several of these in vivo-specific hits have a prognostic effect or 
are inferred to be master regulators of protein activity in human AML cases. For 
instance, we identified Fermt3, a master regulator of integrin signaling, as 
having in vivo-specific dependency with high prognostic relevance. Overall, we 
show an experimental and computational pipeline for genome-wide functional 
screens in vivo in AML and provide a genome-wide resource of essential drivers 
of leukemic growth in vivo.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by high heritability and 
clinical heterogeneity. The main core symptoms are social communication 
deficits. There are no medications approved for the treatment of these symptoms, 
and medications used to treat non-specific symptoms have serious side effects. 
To identify potential drugs for repurposing to effectively treat ASD core 
symptoms, we studied ASD risk genes within networks of protein-protein 
interactions of gene products. We first defined an ASD network from 
network-based analyses, and identified approved drugs known to interact with 
proteins within this network. Thereafter, we evaluated if these drugs can change 
ASD-associated gene expression perturbations in genes in the ASD network. This 
was done by analyses of drug-induced versus ASD-associated gene expression, 
where opposite gene expression perturbations in drug versus ASD indicate that 
the drug could counteract ASD-associated perturbations. Four drugs showing 
significant (p < 0.05) opposite gene expression perturbations in drug versus ASD 
were identified: Loperamide, bromocriptine, drospirenone, and progesterone. 
These drugs act on ASD-related biological systems, indicating that these drugs 
could effectively treat ASD core symptoms. Based on our bioinformatics analyses 
of ASD genetics, we shortlist potential drug repurposing candidates that warrant 
clinical translation to treat core symptoms in ASD.

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major blindness-causing disease that is 
characterized by an arrest of normal vascular development and neovascularization 
of the retina. Previous studies have shown that genetic factors may be 
associated with the development and severity of ROP. However, the genes and 
mechanisms underlying ROP remain unclear. We aimed to identify hub genes in ROP 
and drugs related to these genes by integrative analysis. The expression 
profiles of GSE158799 and GSE135844 were acquired from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
identified. Then, an integrative analysis was performed including Gene Ontology 
(GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, transcription factor 
(TF)-gene, and miRNA-gene networks analysis. Moreover, we verified hub genes and 
identified potential drugs. 225 common DEGs were identified. Biological function 
analysis indicated that angiogenesis, cell surface, cell adhesion, extracellular 
matrix, and focal adhesion genes were enriched among DEGs. The PI3K/Akt 
signalingpathway, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor 
interaction were markedly enriched in the KEGG pathway analysis. Finally, 5 hub 
genes related to the nosogenesis of ROP were identified and found to be targeted 
by VEGFA inhibitors, TLR4 antagonists, and sunitinib. The present study showed 
that VEGFA, ACTA2, MKI67, CD68, and TLR4 are potential hub genes involved in the 
pathogenesis of ROP. Moreover, TLR4 antagonists and sunitinib may be new 
candidate drugs for ROP therapy, in addition to VEGFA inhibitors.

Background: Previous studies revealed that the gene signatures are associated 
with the modulation and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 
However, identifying critical transcriptional signatures in the blood of PAH 
patients remains lacking. Methods: The differentially expressed transcriptional 
signatures in the blood of PAH patients were identified by a meta-analysis from 
four microarray datasets. Then we investigated the enrichment of gene ontology 
and KEGG pathways and identified top hub genes. Besides, we investigated the 
correlation of crucial hub genes with immune infiltrations, hallmark gene sets, 
and blood vessel remodeling genes. Furthermore, we investigated the diagnostic 
efficacy of essential hub genes and their expression validation in an 
independent cohort of PAH, and we validate the expression level of hub genes in 
monocrotaline (MCT) induced PAH rats' model. Finally, we have identified the 
FDA-approved drugs that target the hub genes and their molecular docking. 
Results: We found 1,216 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 521 
up-regulated and 695 down-regulated genes, in the blood of the PAH patients. The 
up-regulated DEGs are significantly associated with the enrichment of KEGG 
pathways mainly involved with immune regulation, cellular signaling, and 
metabolisms. We identified 13 master transcriptional regulators targeting the 
dysregulated genes in PAH. The STRING-based investigation identified the 
function of hub genes associated with multiple immune-related pathways in PAH. 
The expression levels of RPS27A, MAPK1, STAT1, RPS6, FBL, RPS3, RPS2, and GART 
are positively correlated with ssGSEA scores of various immune cells as 
positively correlated with the hallmark of oxidative stress. Besides, we found 
that these hub genes also regulate the vascular remodeling in PAH. Furthermore, 
the expression levels of identified hub genes showed good diagnostic efficacy in 
the blood of PAH, and we validated most of the hub genes are consistently 
dysregulated in an independent PAH cohort. Validation of hub genes expression 
level in the monocrotaline (MCT)-induced lung tissue of rats with PAH revealed 
that 5 screened hub genes (MAPK1, STAT1, TLR4, TLR2, GART) are significantly 
highly expressed in PAH rats, and 4 screened hub genes (RPS6, FBL, RPS3, and 
RPS2) are substantially lowly expressed in rats with PAH. Finally, we analyzed 
the interaction of hub proteins and FDA-approved drugs and revealed their 
molecular docking, and the results showed that MAPK1, TLR4, and GART interact 
with various drugs with appropriate binding affinity. Conclusion: The identified 
blood-derived key transcriptional signatures significantly correlate with immune 
infiltrations, hypoxia, glycolysis, and blood vessel remodeling genes. These 
findings may provide new insight into the diagnosis and treatment of PAH 
patients.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the malignant epithelial tumors with a 
high metastasis rate. This study aimed to screen potential novel biomarkers 
involved in NPC metastasis. Microarray data of locoregionally advanced NPC 
(LA-NPC; GSE103611) were obtained from the database of Gene Expression Omnibus. 
The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LA-NPC tissues with and 
without distant metastasis after radical treatment were screened. Functional 
analysis was performed and the protein-protein interaction and submodule were 
analyzed. The univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify 
prognostic genes in NPC in the validation microarray dataset GSE102349. The 
drug-gene interactions and key genes were identified. Totally, 107 DEGs were 
identified. The upregulated DEGs and the key nodes in the protein-protein 
interaction network were associated with pathways or biological processes 
related to the cell cycle. Four genes including CD44, B2M, PTPN11, and TRIM74 
were associated with disease-free survival in NPC. The drug-gene interaction 
analysis revealed that upregulated genes CXCL10, CD44, B2M, XRCC5, and RPL11 
might be potential druggable genes for patients with LA-NPC metastasis by 
regulating cell cycle, autophagy, and drug resistance. Upregulated CXCL10, CD44, 
B2M, XRCC5, and RPL11 might play important roles in LA-NPC metastasis by 
regulating cell cycle-related pathways.

Diabetes and its related complications are associated with long term damage and 
failure of various organ systems. The microvascular complications of diabetes 
considered in this study are diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, and 
diabetic nephropathy. The aim is to identify the weighted co-expressed and 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), major pathways, and their miRNA, 
transcription factors (TFs) and drugs interacting in all the three conditions. 
The primary goal is to identify vital DEGs in all the three conditions. The 
overlapped five genes (AKT1, NFKB1, MAPK3, PDPK1, and TNF) from the DEGs and the 
co-expressed genes were defined as key genes, which differentially expressed in 
all the three cases. Then the protein-protein interaction network and gene set 
linkage analysis (GSLA) of key genes was performed. GSLA, gene ontology, and 
pathway enrichment analysis of the key genes elucidates nine major pathways in 
diabetes. Subsequently, we constructed the miRNA-gene and transcription 
factorgene regulatory network of the five gene of interest in the nine major 
pathways were studied. hsa-mir-34a-5p, a major miRNA that interacted with all 
the five genes. RELA, FOXO3, PDX1 and SREBF1 were the TFs interacting with the 
major five gene of interest. Finally, drug-gene interaction network elucidates 
five potential drugs to treat the genes of interest. This research reveals 
biomarker genes, miRNA, TFs, and therapeutic drugs in the key signaling 
pathways, which may help us, understand the processes of all three secondary 
microvascular problems and aid in disease detection and management.

Genetically informed drug development and repurposing is an attractive prospect 
for improving patient outcomes in psychiatry; however, the effectiveness of 
these endeavors is confounded by heterogeneity. We propose an approach that 
links interventions implicated by disorder-associated genetic risk, at the 
population level, to a framework that can target these compounds to individuals. 
Specifically, results from genome-wide association studies are integrated with 
expression data to prioritize individual "directional anchor" genes for which 
the predicted risk-increasing direction of expression could be counteracted by 
an existing drug. While these compounds represent plausible therapeutic 
candidates, they are not likely to be equally efficacious for all individuals. 
To account for this heterogeneity, we constructed polygenic scores restricted to 
variants annotated to the network of genes that interact with each directional 
anchor gene. These metrics, which we call a pharmagenic enrichment score (PES), 
identify individuals with a higher burden of genetic risk, localized in 
biological processes related to the candidate drug target, to inform precision 
drug repurposing. We used this approach to investigate schizophrenia and bipolar 
disorder and reveal several compounds targeting specific directional anchor 
genes that could be plausibly repurposed. These genetic risk scores, mapped to 
the networks associated with target genes, revealed biological insights that 
cannot be observed in undifferentiated genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS). 
For example, an enrichment of these partitioned scores in schizophrenia cases 
with otherwise low PRS. In summary, genetic risk could be used more specifically 
to direct drug repurposing candidates that target particular genes implicated in 
psychiatric and other complex disorders.

Herbal medicine, a multi-component treatment, has been extensively practiced for 
treating various symptoms and diseases. However, its molecular mechanism of 
action on the human body is unknown, which impedes the development and 
application of herbal medicine. To address this, recent studies are increasingly 
adopting systems pharmacology, which interprets pharmacological effects of drugs 
from consequences of the interaction networks that drugs might have. Most 
conventional network- based approaches collect associations of herb-compound, 
compound-target, and target-disease from individual databases, respectively, and 
construct an integrated network of herb-compound- target-disease to study the 
complex mechanisms underlying herbal treatment. More recently, rapid advances in 
highthroughput omics technology have led numerous studies to exploring gene 
expression profiles induced by herbal treatments to elicit information on direct 
associations between herbs and genes at the genome-wide scale. In this review, 
we summarize key databases and computational methods utilized in systems 
pharmacology for studying herbal medicine. We also highlight recent studies that 
identify modes of action or novel indications of herbal medicine by harnessing 
drug-induced transcriptome data. [BMB Reports 2022; 55(9): 417-428].

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor in 
adults. Glioma stem like cells (GSC) represent the highest cellular hierarchy in 
GBM and have a determining role in tumor growth, recurrence and patient 
prognosis. However, a better definition of GSC subpopulations, especially at the 
surgical resection margin, is warranted for improved oncological treatment 
options. The present study interrogated cells expressing CD105 (CD105+) 
specifically within the tumor front and the pre-invasive niche as a potential 
GSC subpopulation. GBM primary cell lines were generated from patients (n = 18) 
and CD105+ cells were isolated and assessed for stem-like characteristics. In 
vitro, CD105+ cells proliferated and enriched in serum-containing medium but not 
in serum-free conditions. CD105+ cells were characterized by Nestin+, Vimentin+ 
and SOX2-, clearly distinguishing them from SOX2+ GCS. GBM CD105+ cells 
differentiated into osteocytes and adipocytes but not chondrocytes. Exome 
sequencing revealed that GBM CD105+ cells matched 83% of somatic mutations in 
the Cancer cell line encyclopedia, indicating a malignant phenotype and in vivo 
xenotransplantation assays verified their tumorigenic potential. Cytokine assays 
showed that immunosuppressive and protumorigenic cytokines such as IL6, IL8, 
CCL2, CXCL-1 were produced by CD105+ cells. Finally, screening for 88 clinical 
drugs revealed that GBM CD105+ cells are resistant to most chemotherapeutics 
except Doxorubicin, Idarubicin, Fludarabine and ABT-751. Our study provides a 
rationale for targeting tumoral CD105+ cells in order to reshape the tumor 
microenvironment and block GBM progression.

Acute myocardial infraction is the most severe type of coronary artery disease 
and remains a substantial burden to the health care system globally. Although 
myocardial reperfusion is critical for ischemic cardiac tissue survival, the 
reperfusion itself could cause paradoxical injury. This paradoxical phenomenon 
is known as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and the exact molecular mechanism 
of IRI is still far from being elucidated and is a topic of controversy. 
Meanwhile, ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of cell death that has been 
reported to be associated with various cardiovascular diseases. Thus, we 
explored the potential ferroptosis mechanism and target in cardiac IRI via 
bioinformatics analysis and experiment. GSE4105 data were obtained from the GEO 
database and consist of a rat IRI model and control. After identifying 
differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) and hub genes of 
cardiac IRI, we performed enrichment analysis, coexpression analysis, drug-gene 
interaction prediction, and mRNA-miRNA regulatory network construction. 
Moreover, we validated and explored the multitemporal expression of hub genes in 
a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9C2 cell injury model under different 
conditions via RT-qPCR. A total of 43 DEFRGs and 7 hub genes (tumor protein p53 
[Tp53], tumor necrosis factor [Tnf], hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha 
[Hif1a], interleukin 6 [Il6], heme oxygenase 1 [Hmox1], X-box binding protein 1 
[Xbp1], and caspase 8 [Casp8]) were screened based on bioinformatics analysis. 
The functional annotation of these genes revealed apoptosis, and the related 
signaling pathways could have association with the pathogenesis of ferroptosis 
in cardiac IRI. In addition, the expression of the seven hub genes in IRI models 
were found higher than that of control under different H/R conditions and time 
points. In conclusion, the analysis of 43 DEFRGs and 7 hub genes could reveal 
the potential biological pathway and mechanism of ferroptosis in cardiac IRI. In 
addition, the multitemporal expression change of hub genes in H9C2 cells under 
different H/R conditions could provide clues for further ferroptosis mechanism 
exploring, and the seven hub genes could be potential biomarkers or therapeutic 
targets in cardiac IRI.

Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors. High-grade gliomas, 
represented by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have a poor prognosis and are 
prone to recurrence. The standard treatment strategy is tumor removal combined 
with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, such as temozolomide (TMZ). However, even 
after conventional treatment, they still have a high recurrence rate, resulting 
in an increasing demand for effective anti-glioma drugs. Drug repurposing is a 
method of reusing drugs that have already been widely approved for new 
indication. It has the advantages of reduced research cost, safety, and 
increased efficiency. Disulfiram (DSF), originally approved for alcohol 
dependence, has been repurposed for adjuvant chemotherapy in glioma. This 
article reviews the drug repurposing method and the progress of research on 
disulfiram reuse for glioma treatment.

Cervical cancer (CC) is considered as the fourth most common women 
cancer globally.that shows malignant features of local infiltration and invasion 
into adjacent organs and tissues. There are several individual studies in the 
literature that explored CC-causing hub-genes (HubGs), however, we observed that 
their results are not so consistent. Therefore, the main objective of this study 
was to explore hub of the HubGs (hHubGs) that might be more representative 
CC-causing HubGs compare to the single study based HubGs. We reviewed 52 
published articles and found 255 HubGs/studied-genes in total. Among them, we 
selected 10 HubGs (CDK1, CDK2, CHEK1, MKI67, TOP2A, BRCA1, PLK1, CCNA2, CCNB1, 
TYMS) as the hHubGs by the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. 
Then, we validated their differential expression patterns between CC and control 
samples through the GPEA database. The enrichment analysis of HubGs revealed 
some crucial CC-causing biological processes (BPs), molecular functions (MFs) 
and cellular components (CCs) by involving hHubGs. The gene regulatory network 
(GRN) analysis identified four TFs proteins and three miRNAs as the key 
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of hHubGs. Then, we 
identified hHubGs-guided top-ranked FDA-approved 10 candidate drugs and 
validated them against the state-of-the-arts independent receptors by molecular 
docking analysis. Finally, we investigated the binding stability of the 
top-ranked three candidate drugs (Docetaxel, Temsirolimus, Paclitaxel) by using 
100 ns MD-based MM-PBSA simulations and observed their stable performance. 
Therefore the finding of this study might be the useful resources for CC 
diagnosis and therapies.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response is important in dilated cardiomyopathy 
(DCM). However, the expression of inflammatory response genes (IRGs) and 
regulatory mechanisms in DCM has not been well characterized.
METHODS: We analyzed 27,665 cells of single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of four 
DCM samples and two healthy controls (HC). IRGs among differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) of active cell clusters were screened from the Molecular Signatures 
Database (MSigDB). The bulk sequencing dataset of 166 DCM patients and 166 HC 
was analyzed to explore the common IRGs. The biological functions of the IRGs 
were analyzed according to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. IRG-related transcription factors (TFs) were 
determined using the TRRUST database. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network was constructed using the STRING database. Then, we established the 
noncoding RNA (ncRNA) regulatory network based on the StarBase database. 
Finally, the potential drugs that target IRGs were explored using the Drug Gene 
Interaction Database (DGIdb).
RESULTS: The proportions of dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, NK cells, and T 
cells were increased in DCM patients, whereas monocytes were decreased. DCs 
expressed more IRGs in DCM. The GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the 
functional characteristics of active cells mainly focused on the immune 
response. Thirty-nine IRGs were commonly expressed among active cell cluster 
DEGs, bulk RNA DEGs, and inflammatory response-related genes. ETS1 plays an 
important role in regulation of IRG expression. The competing endogenous RNA 
regulatory network showed the relationship between ncRNA and IRGs. Sankey 
diagram showed that arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) played a major role in 
regulation between TFs and potential drugs.
CONCLUSION: DCs infiltrate into the myocardium and contribute to the immune 
response in DCM. The transcription factor ETS1 plays an important role in 
regulation of IRGs. Moreover, ALOX5 may be a potential therapeutic target for 
DCM.

Objective: Despite being a powerful tool to identify novel variants, genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) are not sufficient to explain the biological function 
of variants. In this study, we aimed to elucidate at the gene level the 
biological mechanisms involved in gastric cancer (GC) development and to 
identify candidate drug target genes. Materials and methods: We conducted a 
systematic review for GWAS on GC following the PRISMA guidelines. Single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-level meta-analysis and gene-based analysis (GBA) 
were performed to identify SNPs and genes significantly associated with GC. 
Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), disease network, pathway enrichment, 
gene ontology, gene-drug, and chemical interaction analyses were conducted to 
elucidate the function of the genes identified by GBA. Results: A review of GWAS 
on GC identified 226 SNPs located in 91 genes. In the comprehensive GBA, 44 
genes associated with GC were identified, among which 12 genes (THBS3, GBAP1, 
KRTCAP2, TRIM46, HCN3, MUC1, DAP3, EFNA1, MTX1, PRKAA1, PSCA, and ABO) were 
eQTL. Using disease network and pathway analyses, we identified that PRKAA, 
THBS3, and EFNA1 were significantly associated with the PI3K-Alt-mTOR-signaling 
pathway, which is involved in various oncogenic processes, and that MUC1 acts as 
a regulator in both the PI3K-Alt-mTOR and P53 signaling pathways. Furthermore, 
RPKAA1 had the highest number of interactions with drugs and chemicals. 
Conclusion: Our study suggests that PRKAA1, a gene in the 
PI3K-Alt-mTOR-signaling pathway, could be a potential target gene for drug 
development associated with GC in the future. Systematic Review Registration:

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent cause of mortality and morbidity. 
The molecular drivers of HF are still largely unknown.
RESULTS: We aimed to identify circulating proteins causally associated with HF 
by leveraging genome-wide genetic association data for HF including 47,309 cases 
and 930,014 controls. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with 
multiple cis instruments as well as network and enrichment analysis using data 
from blood protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) (2,965 blood proteins) 
measured in 3,301 individuals. Nineteen blood proteins were causally associated 
with HF, were not subject to reverse causality and were enriched in 
ligand-receptor and glycosylation molecules. Network pathway analysis of the 
blood proteins showed enrichment in NF-kappa B, TGF beta, lipid in 
atherosclerosis and fluid shear stress. Cross-phenotype analysis of HF 
identified genetic overlap with cardiovascular drugs, myocardial infarction, 
parental longevity and low-density cholesterol. Multi-trait MR identified causal 
associations between HF-associated blood proteins and cardiovascular outcomes. 
Multivariable MR showed that association of BAG3, MIF and APOA5 with HF were 
mediated by the blood pressure and coronary artery disease. According to the 
directional effect and biological action, 7 blood proteins are targets of 
existing drugs or are tractable for the development of novel therapeutics. Among 
the pathways, sialyl Lewis x and the activin type II receptor are potential 
druggable candidates.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrative MR analyses of the blood proteins identified 
causally-associated proteins with HF and revealed pleiotropy of the blood 
proteome with cardiovascular risk factors. Some of the proteins or pathway 
related mechanisms could be targeted as novel treatment approach in HF.

Currently, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are 
widely prevalent in the elderly population, and accumulating evidence implies a 
strong link between them. For example, patients with T2DM have a higher risk of 
developing neurocognitive disorders, including AD, but the exact mechanisms are 
still unclear. This time, by combining bioinformatics analysis and in vivo 
experimental validation, we attempted to find a common biological link between 
AD and T2DM. We firstly downloaded the gene expression profiling (AD: GSE122063; 
T2DM: GSE161355) derived from the temporal cortex. To find the associations, 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the two datasets were filtered and 
intersected. Based on them, enrichment analysis was carried out, and the least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression and 
support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithms were 
used to identify the specific genes. After verifying in the external dataset and 
in the samples from the AD and type 2 diabetes animals, the shared targets of 
the two diseases were finally determined. Based on them, the ceRNA networks were 
constructed. Besides, the logistic regression and single-sample gene set 
enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were performed. As a result, 62 DEGs were totally 
identified between AD and T2DM, and the enrichment analysis indicated that they 
were much related to the function of synaptic vesicle and MAPK signaling 
pathway. Based on the evidence from external dataset and RT-qPCR, CARTPT, EPHA5, 
and SERPINA3 were identified as the marker genes in both diseases, and their 
clinical significance and biological functions were further analyzed. In 
conclusion, discovering and exploring the marker genes that are dysregulated in 
both 2 diseases could help us better comprehend the intrinsic relationship 
between T2DM and AD, which may inspire us to develop new strategies for facing 
the dilemmas of clinical or basic research in cognitive dysfunction.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as a persistent abnormality in the 
structure and function of kidneys and leads to high morbidity and mortality in 
individuals across the world. Globally, approximately 8%-16% of the population 
is affected by CKD. Proper screening, staging, diagnosis, and the appropriate 
management of CKD by primary care clinicians are essential in preventing the 
adverse outcomes associated with CKD worldwide. In light of this, the 
identification of biomarkers for the appropriate management of CKD is urgently 
required. Growing evidence has suggested the role of mRNAs and microRNAs in CKD, 
however, the gene expression profile of CKD is presently uncertain. The present 
study aimed to identify diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for 
patients with CKD. The human microarray profile datasets, consisting of normal 
samples and treated samples were analyzed thoroughly to unveil the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After selection, the interrelationship 
among DEGs was carried out to identify the overlapping DEGs, which were 
visualized using the Cytoscape program. Furthermore, the PPI network was 
constructed from the String database using the selected DEGs. Then, from the PPI 
network, significant modules and sub-networks were extracted by applying the 
different centralities methods (closeness, betweenness, stress, etc.) using 
MCODE, Cytohubba, and Centiserver. After sub-network analysis we identified six 
overlapped hub genes (RPS5, RPL37A, RPLP0, CXCL8, HLA-A, and ANXA1). 
Additionally, the enrichment analysis was undertaken on hub genes to determine 
their significant functions. Furthermore, these six genes were used to find 
their associated miRNAs and targeted drugs. Finally, two genes CXCL8 and HLA-A 
were common for Ribavirin drug (the gene-drug interaction), after docking 
studies HLA-A was selected for further investigation. To conclude our findings, 
we can say that the identified hub genes and their related miRNAs can serve as 
potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CKD treatment 
strategies.

Due to the explosion of cancer genome data and the urgent needs for cancer 
treatment, it is becoming increasingly important and necessary to easily and 
timely analyze and annotate cancer genomes. However, tumor heterogeneity is 
recognized as a serious barrier to annotate cancer genomes at the individual 
patient level. In addition, the interpretation and analysis of cancer 
multi-omics data rely heavily on existing database resources that are often 
located in different data centers or research institutions, which poses a huge 
challenge for data parsing. Here we present CCAS (Cancer genome Consensus 
Annotation System, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ccas/#/home), a one-stop and 
comprehensive annotation system for the individual patient at multi-omics level. 
CCAS integrates 20 widely recognized resources in the field to support data 
annotation of 10 categories of cancers covering 395 subtypes. Data from each 
resource are manually curated and standardized by using ontology frameworks. 
CCAS accepts data on single nucleotide variant/insertion or deletion, 
expression, copy number variation, and methylation level as input files to build 
a consensus annotation. Outputs are arranged in the forms of tables or figures 
and can be searched, sorted, and downloaded. Expanded panels with additional 
information are used for conciseness, and most figures are interactive to show 
additional information. Moreover, CCAS offers multidimensional annotation 
information, including mutation signature pattern, gene set enrichment analysis, 
pathways and clinical trial related information. These are helpful for 
intuitively understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumors and discovering key 
functional genes.

Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful genomics technology to interrogate 
the cellular composition and behaviors of complex systems. While the number of 
scRNA-seq datasets and available computational analysis tools have grown 
exponentially, there are limited systematic data sharing strategies to allow 
rapid exploration and re-analysis of single-cell datasets, particularly in the 
cardiovascular field. We previously introduced PlaqView, an open-source web 
portal for the exploration and analysis of published atherosclerosis single-cell 
datasets. Now, we introduce PlaqView 2.0 (www.plaqview.com), which provides 
expanded features and functionalities as well as additional cardiovascular 
single-cell datasets. We showcase improved PlaqView functionality, backend data 
processing, user-interface, and capacity. PlaqView brings new or improved tools 
to explore scRNA-seq data, including gene query, metadata browser, cell identity 
prediction, ad hoc RNA-trajectory analysis, and drug-gene interaction 
prediction. PlaqView serves as one of the largest central repositories for 
cardiovascular single-cell datasets, which now includes data from human aortic 
aneurysm, gene-specific mouse knockouts, and healthy references. PlaqView 2.0 
brings advanced tools and high-performance computing directly to users without 
the need for any programming knowledge. Lastly, we outline steps to generalize 
and repurpose PlaqView's framework for single-cell datasets from other fields.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicates that the immune microenvironment plays 
a key role in the genesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study 
aimed to establish an immune-related gene (IRG) signature and determine its 
clinical prognostic value in patients with CRC.
METHODS: The RNA sequencing and associated clinical data of CRC were downloaded 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We then screened for 
differentially expressed IRGs by intersecting with IRGs obtained from the 
Immunology Database and Analysis Portal. Functional enrichment analyses were 
carried out to determine the potential biological functions and pathways of the 
IRGs. We also explored the specific molecular mechanisms of the IRGs by 
constructing regulatory networks. Prognostic IRGs were obtained by LASSO 
regression analysis, and subsequently, gene models were constructed in the TCGA 
dataset to confirm the predictive capacity of these IRGs. Finally, we used the 
TIMER tool to assess the immune properties of prognostic IRGs and correlate them 
with immune cells.
RESULTS: We identified 409 differentially expressed IRGs in patients with CRC. 
Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses 
suggested that these differentially expressed IRGs were significantly related to 
102 cancer signalling pathways and various biological functions. Based on the 
prediction and interaction results, we obtained 59 TF-IRG, 48 miRNA-IRG, and 214 
drug-IRG interaction networks for CRC. Four prognostic genes (POMC, TNFRSF19, 
FGF2, and SCG2) were developed by integrating 47 survival-related IRGs and 42 
characteristic CRC genes. The results of gene model showed that patients in the 
low risk group had better survival outcomes compared to those in the high risk 
group. The expression of POMC, TNFRSF19, FGF2, and SCG2 was significantly 
correlated with immune cells.
CONCLUSION: This study identified some valid IRGs, and these findings can 
provide strong evidence for precision immunotherapy in patients with CRC.

Adoptive T cell therapies (ACT) have been curative for a limited number of 
cancer patients. The sensitization of cancer cells to T cell killing may expand 
the benefit of these therapies for more patients. To this end, we use a 
three-step approach to identify cancer genes that disfavor T cell immunity. 
First, we profile gene transcripts upregulated by cancer under selection 
pressure from T cell killing. Second, we identify potential tumor gene targets 
and pathways that disfavor T cell killing using signaling pathway activation 
libraries and genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Finally, we 
implement pharmacological perturbation screens to validate these targets and 
identify BIRC2, ITGAV, DNPEP, BCL2, and ERRα as potential ACT-drug combination 
candidates. Here, we establish that BIRC2 limits antigen presentation and T cell 
recognition of tumor cells by suppressing IRF1 activity and provide evidence 
that BIRC2 inhibition in combination with ACT is an effective strategy to 
increase efficacy.

Most current research has focused on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) alone; however, it is important to 
understand the complex mechanism of COPD progression to LUAD. This study is the 
first to explore the unique and jointly molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis 
of COPD and LUAD across several datasets based on a variety of analysis methods. 
We used weighted correlation network analysis to search hub genes in two 
datasets from public databases: GSE10072 and GSE76925. We explored the unique 
and jointly molecular mechanistic signatures of the two diseases in pathogenesis 
through enrichment analysis, immune infiltration analysis, and therapeutic 
targets analysis. Finally, the results were confirmed using real-time 
quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Fifteen hub genes were identified: GPI, 
EZH2, EFNA4, CFB, ENO1, SH3PXD2B, SELL, CORIN, MAD2L1, CENPF, TOP2A, ASPM, 
IGFBP2, CDKN2A, and ELF3. For the first time, SELL, CORIN, GPI, and EFNA4 were 
found to play a role in the etiology of COPD and LUAD. The LUAD genes identified 
were primarily involved in the cell cycle and DNA replication processes; COPD 
genes we found were related to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, ribosome, and 
T/B-cell receptor signaling pathways. The tumor microenvironment of LUAD 
pathogenesis was influenced by CD4 + T cells, type 1 regulatory T cells, and T 
helper 1 cells. T follicular helper cells, natural killer T cells, and B cells 
all impact the immunological inflammation in COPD. The results of drug targets 
analysis suggest that cisplatin and tretinoin, as well as bortezomib and 
metformin may be potential targeted therapy for patients with COPD combined 
LUAD. These signatures may be provided a new direction for developing early 
interventions and treatments to improve the prognosis of COPD and LUAD.

Senescent cells accumulate within tissues during aging and secrete an array of 
pro-inflammatory molecules known as senescent-associated secretory phenotype 
(SASP), which contribute to the appearance and progression of various chronic 
degenerative diseases. Novel pharmacological approaches aimed at modulating or 
eliminating senescent cells´ harmful effects have recently emerged: Senolytics 
are molecules that selectively eliminate senescent cells, while senomorphics 
modulate or decrease the inflammatory response to specific SASP. So far, the 
physicochemical, structural, and pharmacological properties that define these 
two kinds of pharmacological approaches remain unclear. Therefore, the 
identification and correct choice of molecules, based on their physicochemical, 
structural, and pharmacological properties, likely to exhibit the desired 
senotherapeutic activity is crucial for developing effective, selective, and 
safe senotherapies. Here we compared the physicochemical, structural, and 
pharmacological properties of 84 senolytics and 79 senomorphics using a 
chemoinformatic and systems pharmacology approach. We found great 
physicochemical, structural, and pharmacological similarities between them, also 
reflected in their cellular responses measured through transcriptome 
perturbations. The identified similarities between senolytics and senomorphics 
might explain the dual activity of some of those molecules. These findings will 
help design and discover new, more effective, and highly selective 
senotherapeutic agents.

OBJECTIVE: To identify hallmark genes and biomolecular processes in aortitis 
using high-throughput gene expression profiling, and to provide a range of 
potentially new drug targets (genes) and therapeutics from a pharmacogenomic 
network analysis.
METHODS: Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on surgically resected ascending 
aortic tissues from inflammatory aneurysms (giant cell arteritis [GCA] with or 
without polymyalgia rheumatica, n = 8; clinically isolated aortitis [CIA], 
n = 17) and noninflammatory aneurysms (n = 25) undergoing surgical aortic 
repair. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the 2 patient groups were 
identified while controlling for clinical covariates. A protein-protein 
interaction model, drug-gene target information, and the DEGs were used to 
construct a pharmacogenomic network for identifying promising drug targets and 
potentially new treatment strategies in aortitis.
RESULTS: Overall, tissue gene expression patterns were the most associated with 
disease state than with any other clinical characteristic. We identified 159 and 
93 genes that were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, 
in inflammatory aortic aneurysms compared to noninflammatory aortic aneurysms. 
We found that the up-regulated genes were enriched in immune-related functions, 
whereas the down-regulated genes were enriched in neuronal processes. Notably, 
gene expression profiles of inflammatory aortic aneurysms from patients with GCA 
were no different than those from patients with CIA. Finally, our 
pharmacogenomic network analysis identified genes that could potentially be 
targeted by immunosuppressive drugs currently approved for other inflammatory 
diseases.
CONCLUSION: We performed the first global transcriptomics analysis in 
inflammatory aortic aneurysms from surgically resected aortic tissues. We 
identified signature genes and biomolecular processes, while finding that CIA 
may be a limited presentation of GCA. Moreover, our computational network 
analysis revealed potential novel strategies for pharmacologic interventions and 
suggests future biomarker discovery directions for the precise diagnosis and 
treatment of aortitis.

INTRODUCTION: Bronchial aspirates (BAS) obtained during invasive mechanical 
ventilation (IMV) constitutes a useful tool for molecular phenotyping and 
decision making.
AIM: To identify the proteomic determinants associated with disease 
pathogenesis, all-cause mortality and respiratory sequelae in BAS samples from 
critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS.
METHODS: Multicenter study including 74 critically ill patients with COVID-19 
and non-COVID-19 ARDS. BAS were obtained by bronchoaspiration after IMV 
initiation. Three hundred sixty-four proteins were quantified using proximity 
extension assay (PEA) technology. Random forest models were used to assess 
predictor importance.
RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding factors, CST5, NADK, SRPK2 and TGF-α 
were differentially detected in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. In random 
forest models for COVID-19, CST5, DPP7, NADK, KYAT1 and TYMP showed the highest 
variable importance. In COVID-19 patients, reduced levels of ENTPD2 and PTN were 
observed in nonsurvivors of ICU stay, even after adjustment. AGR2, NQO2, IL-1α, 
OSM and TRAIL showed the strongest associations with in-ICU mortality and were 
used to construct a protein-based prediction model. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed 
a clear separation in mortality risk between subgroups of PTN, ENTPD2 and the 
prediction model. Cox regression models supported these findings. In survivors, 
the levels of FCRL1, NTF4 and THOP1 in BAS samples obtained during the ICU stay 
correlated with lung function (i.e., DLCO levels) 3 months after hospital 
discharge. Similarly, Flt3L and THOP1 levels were correlated with radiological 
features (i.e., TSS). These proteins are expressed in immune and nonimmune lung 
cells. Poor host response to viral infectivity and an inappropriate reparative 
mechanism seem to be linked with the pathogenesis of the disease and fatal 
outcomes, respectively.
CONCLUSION: BAS proteomics identified novel factors associated with the 
pathology of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS and its adverse outcomes. BAS-based protein 
testing emerges as a novel tool for risk assessment in the ICU.

Skin cutaneous melanoma is a malignant and highly metastatic skin tumor, and its 
morbidity and mortality are still rising worldwide. However, the molecular 
mechanisms that promote melanoma metastasis are unclear. Two datasets (GSE15605 
and GSE46517) were retrieved to identify the differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs), including 23 normal skin tissues (N), 77 primary melanoma tissues (T) 
and 85 metastatic melanoma tissues (M). Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were performed to explore the functions of 
the DEGs. We constructed protein-protein interaction network using the STRING 
database and Cytoscape software. Using the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape, we 
identified the most significant hub genes by five analytical methods (Degree, 
Bottleneck, MCC, MNC, and EPC). Hub gene expression was validated using the 
UALCAN website. Clinical relevance was investigated using The Cancer Genome 
Atlas resources. Finally, we explored the association between 
metastasis-associated genes and immune infiltrates through the Tumor Immune 
Estimation Resource (TIMER) database and performed drug-gene interaction 
analysis using the Drug-Gene Interaction database. A total of 294 specific genes 
were related to melanoma metastasis and were mainly involved in the positive 
regulation of locomotion, mitotic cell cycle process, and epithelial cell 
differentiation. Four hub genes (CDK1, FOXM1, KIF11, and RFC4) were identified 
from the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape. CDK1 was significantly upregulated in 
metastatic melanoma compared with primary melanoma, and high CDK1 expression was 
positively correlated with worse overall survival. Immune infiltration analysis 
revealed that CDK1 expression negatively correlated with macrophage infiltration 
(Rho = - 0.164, P = 2.02e-03) and positively correlated with neutrophil cells 
(Rho = 0.269, P = 2.72e-07) in SKCM metastasis. In addition, we identified that 
CDK1 had a close interaction with 10 antitumor drugs. CDK1 was identified as a 
hub gene involved in the progression of melanoma metastasis and may be regarded 
as a therapeutic target for melanoma patients to improve prognosis and prevent 
metastasis in the future.

A keloid is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiopathogenesis that 
requires ill-defined treatment. Existing evidence indicates that the immune 
system plays an important role in the occurrence and development of keloid. 
However, there is still a lack of research on the immune-related signatures of 
keloid. Here we identified immune-related signatures in keloid and explored 
their pathological mechanisms. Transcriptomic datasets (GSE7890, GSE92566, and 
GSE44270) of keloid and normal skin tissues were obtained from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus database. The overlap of differentially expressed genes and 
immune-related genes was considered as differentially expressed immune-related 
genes (DEIGs). Functional analysis, expression, and distribution were applied to 
explore the function and characteristics of DEIGs, and the expression of these 
DEIGs in keloid and normal skin tissues was verified by immunohistochemistry. 
Finally, we conducted interactive network analysis and immune infiltration 
analysis to determine the therapeutic potential and immune correlation. We 
identified four DEIGs (LGR5, PTN, JAG1, and DKK1). In these datasets, only 
GSE7890 met the screening criteria. In the GSE7890 dataset, DKK1 and PTN were 
downregulated in keloid, whereas JAG1 and LGR5 were upregulated in keloid. In 
addition, we obtained the same conclusion through immunohistochemistry. 
Functional analysis indicated that these four DEIGs were mainly involved in stem 
cell, cell cycle, UV response, and therapy resistance. Through interactive 
network analysis, we found that these DEIGs were associated with drugs currently 
used to treat keloid, such as hydrocortisone, androstanolone, irinotecan, 
oxaliplatin, BHQ-880, and lecoleucovorin. Finally, many immune cells, including 
CD8+ T cells, resting memory CD4+ T cells, and M1 macrophages, were obtained by 
immune infiltration analysis. In conclusion, we identified four immune signaling 
molecules associated with keloid (LGR5, PTN, JAG1, and DKK1). These 
immune-related signaling molecules may be important modules in the pathogenesis 
of keloid. Additionally, we developed novel therapeutic targets for the 
treatment of this challenging disease.

High-throughput DNA sequencing has allowed for the identification of genomic 
alterations and their impact on tumor development, progression, and therapeutic 
responses. In PSCC, for which the incidence has progressively increased 
worldwide, there are still limited data on the molecular mechanisms involved in 
the disease pathogenesis. In this study, we characterized the mutational 
signature of 30 human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated PSCC cases from Latin 
Americans, using whole-exome sequencing. Copy number variations (CNVs) were also 
identified and compared to previous array-generated data. Enrichment analyses 
were performed to reveal disrupted pathways and to identify alterations mapped 
to HPV integration sites (HPVis) and miRNA-mRNA hybridization regions. Among the 
most frequently mutated genes were NOTCH1, TERT, TTN, FAT1, TP53, CDKN2A, RYR2, 
CASP8, FBXW7, HMCN2, and ITGA8. Of note, 92% of these altered genes were 
localized at HPVis. We also found mutations in ten novel genes (KMT2C, SMARCA4, 
PTPRB, AJUBA, CR1, KMT2D, NBEA, FAM135B, GTF2I, and CIC), thus increasing our 
understanding of the potential HPV-disrupted pathways. Therefore, our study 
reveals innovative targets with potential therapeutic benefits for 
HPV-associated PSCCs. The CNV analysis by sequencing (CNV-seq) revealed five 
cancer-associated genes as the most frequent with gains (NOTCH1, MYC, NUMA1, 
PLAG1, and RAD21), while 30% of the tumors showed SMARCA4 with loss. 
Additionally, four cancer-associated genes (CARD11, CSMD3, KDR, and TLX3) 
carried untranslated regions (UTRs) variants, which may impact gene regulation 
by affecting the miRNAs hybridization regions. Altogether, these data contribute 
to the characterization of the mutational spectrum and its impact on cellular 
signaling pathways in PSCC, thus reinforcing the pivotal role of HPV infection 
in the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors.

Multifocal colorectal cancer (CRC) comprises both clonally independent primary 
tumors caused by inherited predisposition and clonally related tumors mainly due 
to intraluminal spreading along an intact basement membrane. The distinction 
between these multifocal CRCs is essential because therapeutic strategies vary 
according to the clonal association of multiple tumor masses. Here, we report 
one unique case of synchronous intestinal cancer (SIC) with tumors occurring 
along the entire bowel tract, including the small intestine. We established six 
patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and patient-derived cell lines (PDCs) from 
each site of the SIC, which were subjected to extensive genomic, transcriptomic, 
and epigenomic sequencing. We also estimated the drug responses of each 
multifocal SIC to 25 clinically relevant therapeutic compounds to validate how 
the clinically actionable alternations between SICs were associated with drug 
sensitivity. Our data demonstrated distinct clonal associations across different 
organs, which were consistently supported by multi-omics analysis, as well as 
the accordant responses to various therapeutic compounds. Our results indicated 
the imminent drawback of a single tumor-based diagnosis of multifocal CRC and 
suggested the necessity of an in-depth molecular analysis of all tumor regions 
to avoid unexpected resistance to the currently available targeted therapies.

Autoimmune diseases (ADs) are at a significantly higher risk of cancers with 
unclear mechanism. By searching GWAS catalog database and Medline, susceptible 
genes for five common ADs, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 
rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and idiopathic 
inflammatory myopathies, were collected and then were overlapped with cancer 
driver genes. Single-cell transcriptome analysis was performed in the 
comparation between SLE and related cancer. We identified 45 carcinogenic 
autoimmune disease risk (CAD) genes, which were mainly enriched in T cell 
signaling pathway and B cell signaling pathway. Integrated single-cell analysis 
revealed immune cell signaling was significantly downregulated in renal cancer 
compared with SLE, while stemness signature was significantly enriched in both 
renal cancer or lymphoma and SLE in specific subpopulations. Drugs targeting CAD 
genes were shared between ADs and cancer. Our study highlights the common and 
specific features between ADs and related cancers, and sheds light on a new 
discovery of treatments.

Despite advances in pharmacology and neuroscience, the path to new medications 
for psychiatric disorders largely remains stagnated. Drug repurposing offers a 
more efficient pathway compared with de novo drug discovery with lower cost and 
less risk. Various computational approaches have been applied to mine the vast 
amount of biomedical data generated over recent decades. Among these methods, 
network-based drug repurposing stands out as a potent tool for the comprehension 
of multiple domains of knowledge considering the interactions or associations of 
various factors. Aligned well with the poly-pharmacology paradigm shift in drug 
discovery, network-based approaches offer great opportunities to discover 
repurposing candidates for complex psychiatric disorders. In this review, we 
present the potential of network-based drug repurposing in psychiatry focusing 
on the incentives for using network-centric repurposing, major network-based 
repurposing strategies and data resources, applications in psychiatry and 
challenges of network-based drug repurposing. This review aims to provide 
readers with an update on network-based drug repurposing in psychiatry. We 
expect the repurposing approach to become a pivotal tool in the coming years to 
battle debilitating psychiatric disorders.

Recent genome-wide association studies uncovered part of blood pressure's 
heritability. However, there is still a vast gap between genetics and biology 
that needs to be bridged. Here, we followed up blood pressure genome-wide 
summary statistics of over 750,000 individuals, leveraging comprehensive 
epigenomic and transcriptomic data from blood with a follow-up in cardiovascular 
tissues to prioritise likely causal genes and underlying blood pressure 
mechanisms. We first prioritised genes based on coding consequences, multilayer 
molecular associations, blood pressure-associated expression levels, and 
coregulation evidence. Next, we followed up the prioritised genes in multilayer 
studies of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, functional enrichment, 
and their potential suitability as drug targets. Our analyses yielded 1880 
likely causal genes for blood pressure, tens of which are targets of the 
available licensed drugs. We identified 34 novel genes for blood pressure, 
supported by more than one source of biological evidence. Twenty-eight (82%) of 
these new genes were successfully replicated by transcriptome-wide association 
analyses in a large independent cohort (n = ~220,000). We also found a 
substantial mediating role for epigenetic regulation of the prioritised genes. 
Our results provide new insights into genetic regulation of blood pressure in 
terms of likely causal genes and involved biological pathways offering 
opportunities for future translation into clinical practice.

India confines more than 17% of the world's population and has a diverse genetic 
makeup with several clinically relevant rare mutations belonging to many 
sub-group which are undervalued in global sequencing datasets like the 1000 
Genome data (1KG) containing limited samples for Indian ethnicity. Such 
databases are critical for the pharmaceutical and drug development industry 
where diversity plays a crucial role in identifying genetic disposition towards 
adverse drug reactions. A qualitative and comparative sequence and structural 
study utilizing variant information present in the recently published, largest 
curated Indian genome database (IndiGen) and the 1000 Genome data was performed 
for variants belonging to the kinase coding genes, the second most targeted 
group of drug targets. The sequence-level analysis identified similarities and 
differences among different populations based on the nsSNVs and amino acid 
exchange frequencies whereas a comparative structural analysis of IndiGen 
variants was performed with pathogenic variants reported in UniProtKB Humsavar 
data. The influence of these variations on structural features of the protein, 
such as structural stability, solvent accessibility, hydrophobicity, and the 
hydrogen-bond network was investigated. In-silico screening of the known drugs 
to these Indian variation-containing proteins reveals critical differences 
imparted in the strength of binding due to the variations present in the Indian 
population. In conclusion, this study constitutes a comprehensive investigation 
into the understanding of common variations present in the second largest 
population in the world and investigating its implications in the sequence, 
structural and pharmacogenomic landscape. The preliminary investigation reported 
in this paper, supporting the screening and detection of ADRs specific to the 
Indian population could aid in the development of techniques for pre-clinical 
and post-market screening of drug-related adverse events in the Indian 
population.

Endometriosis remains a common but challenging gynecological disease among 
reproductive-aged women with an unclear pathogenesis and limited therapeutic 
options. Numerous pieces of evidence suggest that NF-κB signaling, a major 
regulator of inflammatory responses, is overactive in endometriotic lesions and 
contributes to the onset, progression, and recurrence of endometriosis. Several 
factors, such as estrogen, progesterone, oxidative stress, and noncoding RNAs, 
can regulate NF-κB signaling in endometriosis. In the present review, we discuss 
the mechanisms by which these factors regulate NF-κB during endometriosis 
progression and provide an update on the role of NF-κB in affecting 
endometriotic cells, peritoneal macrophages (PMs) as well as 
endometriosis-related symptoms, such as pain and infertility. Furthermore, the 
preclinical drugs for blocking NF-κB signaling in endometriosis are summarized, 
including plant-derived medicines, NF-κB inhibitors, other known drugs, and the 
potential anti-NF-κB drugs predicted through the Drug-Gene Interaction Database. 
The present review discusses most of the studies concerning the multifaceted 
role of NF-κB signaling in endometriosis and provides a summary of 
NF-κB-targeted treatment in detail.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the relationship between primary ovarian 
insufficiency and autophagy, we detected and got the expression profile of human 
granulosa cell line SVOG, which was with or without LPS induced. The expression 
profile was analyzed with the focus on the autophagy genes, among which hub 
genes were identified.
RESULTS: Totally, 6 genes were selected as candidate hub genes which might 
correlate with the process of primary ovarian insufficiency. The expression of 
hub genes was then validated by quantitative real-time PCR and two of them had 
significant expression change. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to observe 
the features of hub genes, including hub gene-RBP/TF/miRNA/drug network 
construction, functional analysis, and protein-protein interaction network. 
Pearson's correlation analysis was also performed to identify the correlation 
between hub genes and autophagy genes, among which there were four autophagy 
genes significantly correlated with hub genes, including ATG4B, ATG3, ATG13, and 
ULK1.
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that autophagy might play an essential role in 
the process and underlying molecular mechanism of primary ovarian insufficiency, 
which was revealed for the first time and may help to provide a molecular 
foundation for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for 
primary ovarian insufficiency.

The manifestation of intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity hinders the 
development of ubiquitous cancer treatments, thus requiring a tailored therapy 
for each cancer type. Specifically, the reprogramming of cellular metabolism has 
been identified as a source of potential drug targets. Drug discovery is a long 
and resource-demanding process aiming at identifying and testing compounds early 
in the drug development pipeline. While drug repurposing efforts (i.e., 
inspecting readily available approved drugs) can be supported by a mechanistic 
rationale, strategies to further reduce and prioritize the list of potential 
candidates are still needed to facilitate feasible studies. Although a variety 
of 'omics' data are widely gathered, a standard integration method with modeling 
approaches is lacking. For instance, flux balance analysis is a metabolic 
modeling technique that mainly relies on the stoichiometry of the metabolic 
network. However, exploring the network's topology typically neglects 
biologically relevant information. Here we introduce Transcriptomics-Informed 
Stoichiometric Modelling And Network analysis (TISMAN) in a recombinant 
innovation manner, allowing identification and validation of genes as targets 
for drug repurposing using glioblastoma as an exemplar.

Nociceptors are a type of sensory neuron that are integral to most forms of 
pain. Targeted disruption of nociceptor sensitization affords unique 
opportunities to prevent pain. An emerging model for nociceptors are sensory 
neurons derived from human stem cells. Here, we subjected five groups to 
high-throughput sequencing: human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) prior 
to differentiation, mature hiPSC-derived sensory neurons, mature co-cultures 
containing hiPSC-derived astrocytes and sensory neurons, mouse dorsal root 
ganglion (DRG) tissues, and mouse DRG cultures. Co-culture of nociceptors and 
astrocytes promotes expression of transcripts enriched in DRG tissues. 
Comparisons of the hiPSC models to tissue samples reveal that many key 
transcripts linked to pain are present. Markers indicative of a range of 
neuronal subtypes present in the DRG were detected in mature hiPSCs. 
Intriguingly, translation factors were maintained at consistently high 
expression levels across species and culture systems. As a proof of concept for 
the utility of this resource, we validated expression of eukaryotic initiation 
factor 5A (eIF5A) in DRG tissues and hiPSC samples. eIF5A is subject to a unique 
posttranslational hypusine modification required for its activity. Inhibition of 
hypusine biosynthesis prevented hyperalgesic priming by inflammatory mediators 
in vivo and diminished hiPSC activity in vitro. Collectively, our results 
illuminate the transcriptomes of hiPSC sensory neuron models. We provide a 
demonstration for this resource through our investigation of eIF5A. Our findings 
reveal hypusine as a potential target for inflammation associated pain in males.

More than 800 million people suffer from kidney disease, yet the mechanism of 
kidney dysfunction is poorly understood. In the present study, we define the 
genetic association with kidney function in 1.5 million individuals and identify 
878 (126 new) loci. We map the genotype effect on the methylome in 443 kidneys, 
transcriptome in 686 samples and single-cell open chromatin in 57,229 kidney 
cells. Heritability analysis reveals that methylation variation explains a 
larger fraction of heritability than gene expression. We present a multi-stage 
prioritization strategy and prioritize target genes for 87% of kidney function 
loci. We highlight key roles of proximal tubules and metabolism in kidney 
function regulation. Furthermore, the causal role of SLC47A1 in kidney disease 
is defined in mice with genetic loss of Slc47a1 and in human individuals 
carrying loss-of-function variants. Our findings emphasize the key role of bulk 
and single-cell epigenomic information in translating genome-wide association 
studies into identifying causal genes, cellular origins and mechanisms of 
complex traits.

Cardiometabolic disorders have known inflammatory implications, and peripheral 
measures of inflammation and cardiometabolic disorders are common in persons 
with psychotic disorders. Inflammatory signatures are also related to 
neurobiological and behavioral changes in psychosis. Relationships between 
systemic inflammation and cardiometabolic genetic risk in persons with psychosis 
have not been examined. Thirteen peripheral inflammatory markers and genome-wide 
genotyping were assessed in 122 participants (n ​= ​86 psychosis, n ​= ​36 
healthy controls) of European ancestry. Cluster analyses of inflammatory markers 
classified higher and lower inflammation subgroups. Single-trait genetic risk 
scores (GRS) were constructed for each participant using previously reported 
GWAS summary statistics for the following traits: schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder, major depressive disorder, coronary artery disease, type-2 diabetes, 
low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and 
waist-to-hip ratio. Genetic correlations across traits were quantified. 
Principal component (PC) analysis of the cardiometabolic GRSs generated six PC 
loadings used in regression models to examine associations with inflammation 
markers. Functional module discovery explored biological mechanisms of the 
inflammation association of cardiometabolic GRS genes. A subgroup of 38% persons 
with psychotic disorders was characterized with higher inflammation status. 
These higher inflammation individuals had lower BACS scores (p ​= ​0.038) 
compared to those with lower inflammation. The first PC of the cardiometabolic 
GRS matrix was related to higher inflammation status in persons with psychotic 
disorders (OR ​= ​2.037, p ​= ​0.001). Two of eight modules within the 
functional interaction network of cardiometabolic GRS genes were enriched for 
immune processes. Cardiometabolic genetic risk may predispose some individuals 
with psychosis to elevated inflammation which adversely impacts cognition 
associated with illness.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a typical 
Gastro-Intestinal (GI) tract neoplasm. This study was conducted to know the 
Differential Expressed Genes (DEGs) profile of ESCC along with hub gene 
screening, lncRNA identification, and drug-genes interactions.
METHODS: GSE161533, GSE20347, GSE45670 microarray datasets were retrieved from 
the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GEO2R was used for the DEGs 
identification, whereas GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG enrichment analysis were 
performed in DAVID. PPI network constructed using STRING and visualized with 
Cytoscape app with the help of MCODE. The top ten connectivity genes were 
selected as hub genes-further survival analysis was performed in the 
Kaplan-Meier plotter. Moreover, Boxplot, pathological stage plots were 
constructed using GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis). The 
methylation heatmap assembled in the DiseaseMeth version 2.0. lncRNA (Long 
non-coding RNA) was identified comparing the list of genes in HUGO, and 
Gene-drug interactions were accumulated from the DgiDB platform.
RESULTS: This experiment showed 16 upregulated, and 59 downregulated DEGs shared 
among the three datasets. Biological process analysis showed significant terms 
such as extracellular matrix disassembly and collagen catabolism. The 
extracellular region was detected as the most crucial cellular compartment. 
Notably, metalloen dopeptidease and serine-type endopeptidase activity showed 
significant molecular functions term. In contrast, transcriptional misregulation 
was a highly substantial KEGG pathway. Kaplan-Meier plotter showed higher 
expression of CXCL8, SPP1, MMP13, CXCL1, and TOP2A have a significant impact on 
the overall survival of the patients. Nine out of ten hub genes have 
significantly different expression levels than normal and cancer tissues. HYMAI 
was the only lncRNA commonly expressed upregulated among the three datasets. 
Drug-gene interaction showed multiple genes have no drug options exist till now.

OBJECTIVE: This study identified underlying genetic molecules associated with 
histologically unstable carotid atherosclerotic plaques through bioinformatics 
analysis that may be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
METHODS: Three transcriptome datasets (GSE41571, GSE120521 and E-MTAB-2055) and 
one non-coding RNA dataset (GSE111794) that met histological grouping criteria 
of unstable plaque were downloaded. The common differentially expressed genes 
(co-DEGs) of unstable plaques identified from three mRNA datasets were annotated 
by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics (KEGG). A 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to present the 
interaction between co-DEGs and screen out hub genes. MiRNet database and 
GSE111794 dataset were used to identify the miRNAs targeting hub 
genes. Associated transcription factors (TFs) and drugs were also predicted. 
These predicted results were used to construct miRNA/TFs-hub gene and drug-hub 
gene regulatory networks.
RESULTS: A total of 105 co-DEGs were identified, including 42 up-regulated genes 
and 63 down-regulated genes, which were mainly enriched in collagen-containing 
extracellular matrix, focal adhesion, actin filament bundle, chemokine signaling 
pathway and regulates of actin cytoskeleton. Ten hub genes (up-regulated: HCK, 
C1QC, CD14, FCER1G, LCP1 and RAC2; down-regulated: TPM1, MYH10, PLS3 and FMOD) 
were screened. HCK and RAC2 were involved in chemokine signaling pathway, MYH10 
and RAC2 were involved in regulation of actin cytoskeleton. We also predicted 12 
miRNAs, top5 TFs and 25 drugs targeting hub genes. In the miRNA/TF-hub gene 
regulatory network, PLS3 was the most connected hub genes and was targeted by 
six miRNAs and all five screened TFs. In the drug-hub gene regulatory network, 
HCK was targeted by 20 drugs including 10 inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: We screened 10 hub genes and predicted miRNAs and TFs targeting 
them. These molecules may play a crucial role in the progression of 
histologically unstable carotid plaques and serve as potential biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets.

Objective: To explore the possible biological functions of the differentially 
expressed genes in patients with benign tracheal stenosis, and to provide a 
valuable molecular basis for investigating the pathogenesis of benign tracheal 
stenosis. Method: Whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on blood samples 
collected from patients with benign tracheal stenosis and normal controls. 
Differentially expressed mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA were analyzed using the 
DESeq2 package. The protein interaction networks for differentially expressed 
mRNAs were constructed by STRING. The results of gene co-expression network 
analysis, Starbase database prediction, and differential gene expression were 
combined to construct a competing endogenous RNA network. The transcription 
factors of key genes were predicted using the Network Analyst database and a 
transcription factor-mRNA regulatory network was constructed. The classical 
pathways, intermolecular interaction networks, and upstream regulatory 
components of key genes were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). 
Finally, the DGIDB database was used to predict the potential therapeutic drugs 
to target the identified key genes. Result: Based on mRNA, lncRNA and circRNA 
expression data, we found that differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in 
oxygen transport, neutrophil activation, immune response, and oxygen binding. 
Then the pearson correlation between mRNAs of 46 key genes and lncRNAs and 
cricRNAs were calculated, and the correlation greater than 0.9 were selected to 
construct the co-expression network of "mRNA-lncRA" and "mRNA-cricRNA." 
Moreover, a "lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA" network and a "circRNA-miRNA-mRNA" network were 
constructed. IPA analysis showed that the 46 key genes were significantly 
associated with inflammatory activation and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
The constructed TF-mRNA regulatory network was composed of 274 nodes and 573 
interacting pairs. 251 potential therapeutic drugs were identified from the 
DGIDB database. Conclusion: This study analyzed the differential genes 
associated with benign tracheal stenosis and explored the potential regulatory 
mechanisms, providing a scientific reference for further studies on the 
pathogenesis of benign tracheal stenosis.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, currently available 
therapies have limited success. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are pivotal 
cells in the stroma of gastric tumors posing a great risk for progression and 
chemoresistance. The poor prognostic signature for CAFs is not clear in gastric 
cancer, and drugs that target CAFs are lacking in the clinic. In this study, we 
aim to identify a poor prognostic gene signature for CAFs, targeting which may 
increase the therapeutic success in gastric cancer.
METHODS: We analyzed four GEO datasets with a network-based approach and 
validated key CAF markers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Asian Cancer 
Research Group (ACRG) cohorts. We implemented stepwise multivariate Cox 
regression guided by a pan-cancer analysis in TCGA to identify a poor prognostic 
gene signature for CAF infiltration in gastric cancer. Lastly, we conducted a 
database search for drugs targeting the signature genes.
RESULTS: Our study revealed the COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, FN1, and SPARC 
as the key CAF markers in gastric cancer. Analysis of the TCGA and ACRG cohorts 
validated their upregulation and poor prognostic significance. The stepwise 
multivariate Cox regression elucidated COL1A1 and COL5A1, together with ITGA4, 
Emilin1, and TSPAN9 as poor prognostic signature genes for CAF infiltration. The 
search on drug databases revealed collagenase clostridium histolyticum, 
ocriplasmin, halofuginone, natalizumab, firategrast, and BIO-1211 as the 
potential drugs for further investigation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the central role of extracellular matrix 
components secreted and remodeled by CAFs in gastric cancer. The gene signature 
we identified in this study carries high potential as a predictive tool for poor 
prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Elucidating the mechanisms by which the 
signature genes contribute to poor patient outcomes can lead to the discovery of 
more potent molecular-targeted agents and increase the therapeutic success in 
gastric cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) along with 
infiltrating immune cells landscape and their potential mechanisms in the 
progression of atherosclerosis from onset to plaque rupture.
METHODS: In this study, three atherosclerosis-related microarray datasets were 
downloaded from the NCBI-GEO database. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 
was performed for interpreting the biological insights of gene expression data. 
The CIBERSORTx algorithm was applied to infer the relative proportions of 
infiltrating immune cells of the atherosclerotic samples. DEGs of the datasets 
were screened using R. The protein interaction network was constructed via 
STRING. The cluster genes were analyzed by the Cytoscape software. Gene ontology 
(GO) enrichment was performed via geneontology.org. The least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression algorithm and receiver 
operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to build machine 
learning models for differentiating atherosclerosis status. The Pearson 
correlation analysis was carried out to illustrate the relationship between 
cluster genes and immune cells. The expression levels of the cluster genes were 
validated in two external cohorts. Transcriptional factors and drug-gene 
interaction analysis were performed to investigate the promising targets for 
atherosclerosis intervention.
RESULTS: Pathways related to immunoinflammatory responses were identified 
according to GSEA analysis, and the detailed fractions infiltrating immune cells 
were compared between the early and advanced atherosclerosis. Additionally, we 
identified 170 DEGs in atherosclerosis progression (|log2FC|≥1 and adjusted p < 
0.05). They were mainly enriched in GO terms relating to inflammatory response 
and innate immune response. A cluster of nine genes, such as ITGB2, C1QC, LY86, 
CTSS, C1QA, CSF1R, LAPTM5, VSIG4, and CD163, were found to be significant, and 
their correlations with infiltrating immune cells were calculated. The cluster 
genes were also validated to be upregulated in two external cohorts. Moreover, 
C1QA and ITGB2 may exert pathogenic functions in the entire process of 
atherogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: We reanalyzed the transcriptomic signature of atherosclerosis 
development from onset to plaque rupture along with the landscape of the immune 
cell, as well as revealed new insights and specific prospective DEGs for the 
investigation of disease-associated dynamic molecular processes and their 
regulations with immune cells.

BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic immune disease that involves 
multiple systems. As the pathogenesis of BD is not clear, and new treatments are 
needed, we used bioinformatics to identify potential drugs and validated them in 
mouse models.
METHODS: Behcet's disease-related target genes and proteins were screened in the 
PubMed and UVEOGENE databases. The biological functions and pathways of the 
target genes were analyzed in detail by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network was constructed by the STRING database, and hub genes were 
identified by the Cytoscape plug-in CytoHubba. Gene-drug interactions were 
identified from the DGIdb database. Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice 
were used as an animal model for drug validation.
RESULTS: A total of 249 target genes and proteins with significant differences 
in BD were screened, and the results of functional enrichment analysis suggested 
that these genes and proteins were more located on the cell membrane, involved 
in regulating the production of cytokines and affecting the activity of 
cytokines. They mainly regulated "Cytokine- Cytokine receptor interaction", 
"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)" and "IL-17 signaling Pathway". In addition, 
10 hub genes were obtained through PPI network construction and CytoHubba 
analysis, among which the top 3 hub genes were closely related to BD. The DGIdb 
analysis enriched seven drugs acting together on the top 3 hub genes, four of 
which were confirmed for the treatment of BD or its complications. There is no 
evidence in the research to support the results in omeprazole, rabeprazole, and 
celastrol. However, animal experiments showed that rabeprazole and celastrol 
reduced anterior chamber inflammation and retinal inflammation in EAU mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The functional analysis of genes and proteins related to BD, 
identification of hub genes, and validation of potential drugs provide new 
insights into the disease mechanism and potential for the treatment of BD.

The search for effective therapeutic targets in fields like regenerative 
medicine and cancer research has generated interest in cell fate reprogramming. 
This cellular reprogramming paradigm can drive cells to a desired target state 
from any initial state. However, methods for identifying reprogramming targets 
remain limited for biological systems that lack large sets of experimental data 
or a dynamical characterization. We present NETISCE, a novel computational tool 
for identifying cell fate reprogramming targets in static networks. In 
combination with machine learning algorithms, NETISCE estimates the attractor 
landscape and predicts reprogramming targets using signal flow analysis and 
feedback vertex set control, respectively. Through validations in studies of 
cell fate reprogramming from developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology, we 
show that NETISCE can predict previously identified cell fate reprogramming 
targets and identify potentially novel combinations of targets. NETISCE extends 
cell fate reprogramming studies to larger-scale biological networks without the 
need for full model parameterization and can be implemented by experimental and 
computational biologists to identify parts of a biological system relevant to 
the desired reprogramming task.

Aberrant DNA methylation has emerged as a hallmark in several cancers and 
contributes to risk, oncogenesis, progression, and prognosis. In this study, we 
performed imputation-based and conventional methylome-wide association analyses 
for breast cancer (BrCa) and prostate cancer (PrCa). The imputation-based 
approach identified DNA methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) 
associated with BrCa and PrCa risk utilising genome-wide association summary 
statistics (NBrCa = 228,951, NPrCa = 140,254) and prebuilt methylation 
prediction models, while the conventional approach identified CpG associations 
utilising TCGA and GEO experimental methylation data (NBrCa = 621, NPrCa = 241). 
Enrichment analysis of the association results implicated 77 and 81 genetically 
influenced CpGs for BrCa and PrCa, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of 
differential gene expression around these CpGs suggests a 
genome-epigenome-transcriptome mechanistic relationship. Conditional analyses 
identified multiple independent secondary SNP associations (Pcond < 0.05) around 
28 BrCa and 22 PrCa CpGs. Cross-cancer analysis identified eight common CpGs, 
including a strong therapeutic target in SREBF1 (17p11.2)-a key player in lipid 
metabolism. These findings highlight the utility of integrative analysis of 
multi-omic cancer data to identify robust biomarkers and understand their

Cancer progression is linked to aberrant protein glycosylation due to the 
overexpression of several glycosylation enzymes. These enzymes are 
underexploited as potential anticancer drug targets and the development of 
rapid-screening methods and identification of glycosylation inhibitors are 
highly sought. An integrated bioinformatics and mass spectrometry-based 
glycomics-driven glycoproteomics analysis pipeline was performed to identify an 
N-glycan inhibitor against lung cancer cells. Combined network pharmacology and 
in silico screening approaches were used to identify a potential inhibitor, 
pictilisib, against several glycosylation-related proteins, such as 
Alpha1-6FucT, GlcNAcT-V, and Alpha2,6-ST-I. A glycomics assay of lung cancer 
cells treated with pictilisib showed a significant reduction in the fucosylation 
and sialylation of N-glycans, with an increase in high mannose-type glycans. 
Proteomics analysis and in vitro assays also showed significant upregulation of 
the proteins involved in apoptosis and cell adhesion, and the downregulation of 
proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, mRNA processing, and protein 
translation. Site-specific glycoproteomics analysis further showed that 
glycoproteins with reduced fucosylation and sialylation were involved in 
apoptosis, cell adhesion, DNA damage repair, and chemical response processes. To 
determine how the alterations in N-glycosylation impact glycoprotein dynamics, 
modeling of changes in glycan interactions of the ITGA5-ITGB1 (Integrin alpha 
5-Integrin beta-1) complex revealed specific glycosites at the interface of 
these proteins that, when highly fucosylated and sialylated, such as in 
untreated A549 cells, form greater hydrogen bonding interactions compared to the 
high mannose-types in pictilisib-treated A549 cells. This study highlights the 
use of mass spectrometry to identify a potential glycosylation inhibitor and 
assessment of its impact on cell surface glycoprotein abundance and 
protein-protein interaction.

Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe respiratory disorder occurring in critical 
care medicine, with high rates of mortality and morbidity. This study aims to 
screen the potential biomarkers for ALI. Microarray data of lung tissues from 
lung-specific geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase large subunit 1 knockout and 
wild-type mice treated with lipopolysaccharide were downloaded. Differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between ALI and wild-type mice were screened. Functional 
analysis and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) modules were analyzed. 
Finally, a miRNA-transcription factor (TF)-target regulation network was 
constructed. Totally, 421 DEGs between ALI and wild-type mice were identified. 
The upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in the peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, and fatty acid metabolic 
process, while downregulated DEGs were related to cytokine-cytokine receptor 
interaction and regulation of cytokine production. Cxcl5, Cxcl9, Ccr5, and Cxcr4 
were key nodes in the PPI network. In addition, three miRNAs (miR505, miR23A, 
and miR23B) and three TFs (PU1, CEBPA, and CEBPB) were key molecules in the 
miRNA-TF-target network. Nine genes including ADRA2A, P2RY12, ADORA1, CXCR1, and 
CXCR4 were predicted as potential druggable genes. As a conclusion, ADRA2A, 
P2RY12, ADORA1, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCR1, and CXCR4 might be novel markers and 
potential druggable genes in ALI by regulating inflammatory response.

Lung cancer is the most common cancer in men and women. This cancer is divided 
into two main types, namely non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell 
lung cancer (SCLC). Around 85 to 90 percent of lung cancers are 
NSCLC. Repositioning potent candidate drugs in NSCLC treatment is one of the 
important topics in cancer studies. Drug repositioning (DR) or drug repurposing 
is a method for identifying new therapeutic uses of existing drugs. The current 
study applies a computational drug repositioning method to identify candidate 
drugs to treat NSCLC patients. To this end, at first, the transcriptomics 
profile of NSCLC and healthy (control) samples was obtained from the GEO 
database with the accession number GSE21933. Then, the gene co-expression 
network was reconstructed for NSCLC samples using the WGCNA, and two significant 
purple and magenta gene modules were extracted. Next, a list of transcription 
factor genes that regulate purple and magenta modules' genes was extracted from 
the TRRUST V2.0 online database, and the TF-TG (transcription factors-target 
genes) network was drawn. Afterward, a list of drugs targeting TF-TG genes was 
obtained from the DGIdb V4.0 database, and two drug-gene interaction networks, 
including drug-TG and drug-TF, were drawn. After analyzing gene co-expression 
TF-TG, and drug-gene interaction networks, 16 drugs were selected as potent 
candidates for NSCLC treatment. Out of 16 selected drugs, nine drugs, namely 
Methotrexate, Olanzapine, Haloperidol, Fluorouracil, Nifedipine, Paclitaxel, 
Verapamil, Dexamethasone, and Docetaxel, were chosen from the drug-TG 
sub-network. In addition, nine drugs, including Cisplatin, Daunorubicin, 
Dexamethasone, Methotrexate, Hydrocortisone, Doxorubicin, Azacitidine, 
Vorinostat, and Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, were selected from the drug-TF 
sub-network. Methotrexate and Dexamethasone are common in drug-TG and drug-TF 
sub-networks. In conclusion, this study proposed 16 drugs as potent candidates 
for NSCLC treatment through analyzing gene co-expression, TF-TG, and drug-gene 
interaction networks.

The KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements (KMT2A-r) are associated with a diverse 
spectrum of acute leukemias. Although most KMT2A-r are restricted to nine 
partner genes, we have recently revealed that KMT2A-USP2 fusions are often 
missed during FISH screening of these genetic alterations. Therefore, 
complementary methods are important for appropriate detection of any KMT2A-r. 
Here we use a machine learning model to unravel the most appropriate markers for 
prediction of KMT2A-r in various types of acute leukemia. A Random Forest and 
LightGBM classifier was trained to predict KMT2A-r in patients with acute 
leukemia. Our results revealed a set of 20 genes capable of accurately 
estimating KMT2A-r. The SKIDA1 (AUC: 0.839; CI: 0.799-0.879) and LAMP5 (AUC: 
0.746; CI: 0.685-0.806) overexpression were the better markers associated with 
KMT2A-r compared to CSPG4 (also named NG2; AUC: 0.722; CI: 0.659-0.784), 
regardless of the type of acute leukemia. Of importance, high expression levels 
of LAMP5 estimated the occurrence of all KMT2A-USP2 fusions. Also, we performed 
drug sensitivity analysis using IC50 data from 345 drugs available in the GDSC 
database to identify which ones could be used to treat KMT2A-r leukemia. We 
observed that KMT2A-r cell lines were more sensitive to 5-Fluorouracil (5FU), 
Gemcitabine (both antimetabolite chemotherapy drugs), WHI-P97 (JAK-3 inhibitor), 
Foretinib (MET/VEGFR inhibitor), SNX-2112 (Hsp90 inhibitor), AZD6482 (PI3Kβ 
inhibitor), KU-60019 (ATM kinase inhibitor), and Pevonedistat (NEDD8-activating 
enzyme (NAE) inhibitor). Moreover, IC50 data from analyses of ex-vivo drug 
sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors reveals that Foretinib is a promising 
drug option for AML patients carrying FLT3 activating mutations. Thus, we 
provide novel and accurate options for the diagnostic screening and therapy of 
KMT2A-r leukemia, regardless of leukemia subtype.

BACKGROUND: Mechanisms underlying ischemia/reperfusion injury-acute kidney 
injury (IRI-AKI) are not fully elucidated. We conducted an integrative analysis 
of IRI-AKI by bioinformatics methods.
METHODS: We screened gene expression profiles of the IRI-AKI at early phase from 
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were identified and enrichment pathways were conducted based on gene 
ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, and Gene 
set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Immune cell infiltration analysis was performed 
to reveal the change of the microenvironment cell types. We constructed 
protein-protein interaction (PPI), and Cytoscape with plug-ins to find hub genes 
and modules. We performed robust rank aggregation (RRA) to combine DEGs and 
analyzed the target genes for miRNA/transcription factor (TF) and drug-gene 
interaction networks.
RESULTS: A total of 239 and 384 DEGs were identified in GSE87024 and GSE34351 
separately, with the 73 common DEGs. Enrichment analysis revealed that the 
significant pathways involve mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, 
interleukin-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, etc. RRA 
analysis detected a total of 27 common DEGs. Immune cell infiltration analysis 
showed the plasma cells reduced and T cells increased in IRI-AKI. We identified 
JUN, ATF3, FOS, EGR1, HMOX1, DDIT3, JUNB, NFKBIZ, PPP1R15A, CXCL1, ATF4, and 
HSPA1B as hub genes. The target genes interacted with 23 miRNAs and 116 drugs or 
molecular compounds such as curcumin, staurosporine, and deferoxamine.
CONCLUSION: Our study first focused on the early IRI-AKI adopting RRA analysis 
to combine DEGs in different datasets. We identified significant biomarkers and 
crucial pathways involved in IRI-AKI and first construct the immune landscape 
and detected the potential therapeutic targets of the IRI-AKI by drug-gene 
network.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique to 
decipher tissue composition at the single-cell level and to inform on disease 
mechanisms, tumor heterogeneity, and the state of the immune microenvironment. 
Although multiple methods for the computational analysis of scRNA-seq data 
exist, their application in a clinical setting demands standardized and 
reproducible workflows, targeted to extract, condense, and display the 
clinically relevant information. To this end, we designed scAmpi (Single Cell 
Analysis mRNA pipeline), a workflow that facilitates scRNA-seq analysis from raw 
read processing to informing on sample composition, clinically relevant gene and 
pathway alterations, and in silico identification of personalized candidate drug 
treatments. We demonstrate the value of this workflow for clinical decision 
making in a molecular tumor board as part of a clinical study.

BACKGROUND: Knowledges graphs (KGs) serve as a convenient framework for 
structuring knowledge. A number of computational methods have been developed to 
generate KGs from biomedical literature and use them for downstream tasks such 
as link prediction and question answering. However, there is a lack of 
computational tools or web frameworks to support the exploration and 
visualization of the KG themselves, which would facilitate interactive knowledge 
discovery and formulation of novel biological hypotheses.
METHOD: We developed a web framework for Knowledge Graph Exploration and 
Visualization (KGEV), to construct and visualize KGs in five stages: triple 
extraction, triple filtration, metadata preparation, knowledge integration, and 
graph database preparation. The application has convenient user interface tools, 
such as node and edge search and filtering, data source filtering, neighborhood 
retrieval, and shortest path calculation, that work by querying a backend graph 
database. Unlike other KGs, our framework allows fast retrieval of relevant 
texts supporting the relationships in the KG, thus allowing human reviewers to 
judge the reliability of the knowledge extracted.
RESULTS: We demonstrated a case study of using the KGEV framework to perform 
research on COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an explosion of relevant 
literature, making it challenging to make full use of the vast and heterogenous 
sources of information. We generated a COVID-19 KG with heterogenous 
information, including literature information from the CORD-19 dataset, as well 
as other existing knowledge from eight data sources. We showed the utility of 
KGEV in three intuitive case studies to explore and query knowledge on COVID-19. 
A demo of this web application can be accessed at http://covid19nlp.wglab.org . 
Finally, we also demonstrated a turn-key adaption of the KGEV framework to study 
clinical phenotypic presentation of human diseases by Human Phenotype Ontology 
(HPO), illustrating the versatility of the framework.
CONCLUSION: In an era of literature explosion, the KGEV framework can be applied 
to many emerging diseases to support structured navigation of the vast amount of 
newly published biomedical literature and other existing biological knowledge in 
various databases. It can be also used as a general-purpose tool to explore and 
query gene-phenotype-disease-drug relationships interactively.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that enhancer methylation has strong and 
dynamic regulatory effects on gene expression. Some transcription factors (TFs) 
can auto- and cross-regulate in a feed-forward manner, and cooperate with their 
enhancers to form core transcriptional regulatory circuitries (CRCs). However, 
the elaborated regulatory mechanism between enhancer methylation and CRC remains 
the tip of the iceberg. Here, we revealed that DNA methylation could drive the 
tissue-specific enhancer basal transcription and target gene expression in human 
cancers. By integrating methylome, transcriptome, and 3D genomic data, we 
identified enhancer methylation triplets (enhancer methylation-enhancer 
transcription-target gene expression) and dissected potential regulatory 
patterns within them. Moreover, we observed that cancer-specific core TFs 
regulated by enhancers were able to shape their enhancer methylation forming the 
enhancer methylation-driven CRCs (emCRCs). Further parsing of clinical 
implications showed rewired emCRCs could serve as druggable targets and 
prognostic risk markers. In summary, the integrative analysis of enhancer 
methylation regulome would facilitate portraying the cancer epigenomics 
landscape and developing the epigenetic anti-cancer approaches.

As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens human health globally, 
infectious disorders have become one of the most challenging problem for the 
medical community. Natural products (NP) have been a prolific source of 
antimicrobial agents with widely divergent structures and a range vast 
biological activities. A dataset comprising 618 articles, including 646 NP-based 
compounds from 672 species of natural sources with biological activities against 
21 infectious pathogens from five categories, was assembled through manual 
selection of published articles. These data were used to identify 268 NP-based 
compounds classified into ten groups, which were used for network pharmacology 
analysis to capture the most promising lead-compounds such as agelasine D, 
dicumarol, dihydroartemisinin and pyridomycin. The distribution of maximum 
Tanimoto scores indicated that compounds which inhibited parasites exhibited low 
diversity, whereas the chemistries inhibiting bacteria, fungi, and viruses 
showed more structural diversity. A total of 331 species of medicinal plants 
with compounds exhibiting antimicrobial activities were selected to classify the 
family sources. The family Asteraceae possesses various compounds against C. 
neoformans, the family Anacardiaceae has compounds against Salmonella typhi, the 
family Cucurbitacea against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the 
family Ancistrocladaceae against Plasmodium. This review summarizes currently 
available data on NP-based antimicrobials against refractory infections to 
provide information for further discovery of drugs and synthetic strategies for 
anti-infectious agents.

Objective: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical immune modulators to maintain 
immune homeostasis and limit pulmonary hypertension (PH). This study was aimed 
to identify Treg-related genes (TRGs) in PH. Methods: The gene expression 
profile from lungs of PH patients was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database. The abundance of Tregs was estimated by the xCell algorithm, the 
correlation of which with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed. 
DEGs with a |Pearson correlation coefficient| >0.4 were identified as TRGs. 
Functional annotation and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were 
analyzed. A gene signature for 25 hub TRGs (TRGscore) was generated by a single 
sample scoring method to determine its accuracy to distinguish PH from control 
subjects. TRGs were validated in datasets of transcriptional profiling of PH 
cohorts and in lung tissues of experimental PH mice. Results: A total of 819 
DEGs were identified in lungs of 58 PAH patients compared to that of 25 control 
subjects of dataset GSE117261. In total, 165 of all these DEGs were correlated 
with the abundance of Tregs and identified as TRGs, with 90 upregulated genes 
and 75 downregulated genes compared to that of control subjects. The upregulated 
TRGs were enriched in negative regulation of multiple pathways, such as 
cAMP-mediated signaling and I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling, and regulated 
by multiple genes encoding transcriptional factors including HIF1A. Furthermore, 
25 hub genes categorized into three clusters out of 165 TRGs were derived, and 
we identified 27 potential drugs targeting 10 hub TRGs. The TRGscore based on 25 
hub TRGs was higher in PH patients and could distinguish PH from control 
subjects (all AUC >0.7). Among them, 10 genes including NCF2, MNDA/Ifi211, HCK, 
FGR, CSF3R, AQP9, S100A8, G6PD/G6pdx, PGD, and TXNRD1 were significantly reduced 
in lungs of severe PH patients of dataset GSE24988 as well as in lungs of 
hypoxic PH mice compared to corresponding controls. Conclusion: Our finding will 
shed some light on the Treg-associated therapeutic targets in the progression of 
PH and emphasize on TRGscore as a novel indicator for PH.

Background: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), characterized by diverse 
pathological changes, causes low back pain (LBP). However, prophylactic and 
delaying treatments for IDD are limited. The aim of our study was to investigate 
the gene network and biomarkers of IDD and suggest potential therapeutic 
targets. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with IDD were 
identified by analyzing the mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA expression profiles of IDD 
cases from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) analysis as well as miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA networks were conducted. 
Moreover, we obtained 71 hub genes and performed a comprehensive analysis 
including GO, KEGG, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene set variation 
analysis (GSVA), Disease Ontology (DO), methylation analysis, receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, immune infiltration analysis, and potential 
drug identification. We finally used qRT-PCR to verify 13 significant DEGs in 
normal and degenerative nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). Results: We identified 
305 DEGs closely related to IDD. The GO and KEGG analyses indicated that changes 
in IDD are significantly associated with enrichment of the inflammatory and 
immune response. GSEA analysis suggested that cell activation involved in the 
inflammatory immune response amide biosynthetic process was the key for the 
development of IDD. The GSVA suggested that DNA repair, oxidative 
phosphorylation, peroxisome, IL-6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, and apoptosis were 
crucial in the development of IDD. Among the 71 hub genes, the methylation 
levels of 11 genes were increased in IDD. A total of twenty genes showed a high 
functional similarity and diagnostic value in IDD. The result of the immune cell 
infiltration analysis indicated that seven genes were closely related to active 
natural killer cells. The most relevant targeted hub genes for potential drug or 
molecular compounds were MET and PIK3CD. Also, qRT-PCR results showed that 
ARHGAP27, C15orf39, DEPDC1, DHRSX, MGAM, SLC11A1, SMC4, and LINC00887 were 
significantly downregulated in degenerative NPCs; H19, LINC00685, mir-185-5p, 
and mir-4306 were upregulated in degenerative NPCs; and the expression level of 
mir-663a did not change significantly in normal and degenerative NPCs. 
Conclusion: Our findings may provide new insights into the functional 
characteristics and mechanism of IDD and aid the development of IDD 
therapeutics.

Despite advancements made in the therapeutic strategies on hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), the survival rate of HCC patient is not satisfactory enough. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need for the valuable prognostic biomarkers in HCC 
therapy. In this study, we aimed to screen hub genes correlated with prognosis 
of HCC via multiple databases. 117 HCC-related genes were obtained from the 
intersection of the four databases. We subsequently identify 10 hub genes (JUN, 
IL10, CD34, MTOR, PTGS2, PTPRC, SELE, CSF1, APOB, MUC1) from PPI network by 
Cytoscape software analysis. Significant differential expression of hub genes 
between HCC tissues and adjacent tissues were observed in UALCAN, HCCDB and HPA 
databases. These hub genes were significantly associated with immune cell 
infiltrations and immune checkpoints. The hub genes were correlated with 
clinical parameters and survival probability of HCC patients. 147 potential 
targeted therapeutic drugs for HCC were identified through the DGIdb database. 
These hub genes could be used as novel prognostic biomarkers for HCC therapy.

Forkhead-box-P family include FOXP1/2/3/4 and its clinical significance still 
remains unclear in breast cancer (BRCA). We analysed the expressions of FOXPs in 
BRCA patients to determine diagnostic and prognostic values. Our results 
indicated that the transcriptional levels of FOXP3/4 were up-regulated in BRCA 
patients, but FOXP2 were down-regulated. No statistically significant 
correlation were found between the expression levels of FOXPs in Pathologic 
stage. FOXP2/3 had a significantly high AUC value in the detection of breast 
cancer, with 96.8% or 95.7% in accuracy respectively. Our study also suggested 
that BRCA patients with high transcription levels of FOXP1/2/4 were 
significantly associated with longer Overall Survival (OS). In contrast, BRCA 
patients with high transcription level of FOXP3 was not statistically related 
with OS. Our work revealed that FOXPs were closely related to the alteration of 
extensive immune checkpoints in breast invasive carcinoma. Additionally, FOXP3 
has a significant positive correlation with PDCD1, CD274, CTLA4 and TMB in 
breast cancer, and FOXP3 expression showed a statistically significant 
correlation with infiltration of immune cells. Finally, we found that FOXP3 
expression predicted the breast cancer cells response to anticancer drugs. 
Altogether, our work strongly suggested that FOXPs could serve as a biomarker 
for tumor detection, therapeutic design and prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common microvascular complication of 
diabetes and a major cause of end-stage renal disease, resulting in a 
substantial socioeconomic burden around the world. Some unknown biomarkers, 
mechanisms, and potential novel agents regarding DN are yet to be identified.
METHODS: GSE30528 and GSE1009 were downloaded as training datasets to identify 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of DN. Common DEGs were selected for 
further analysis. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) analyses of DEGs were performed to explore molecular mechanisms and 
pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was used to identify 
the top 10 hub genes of DN. Expression profiles of the hub genes were validated 
in GSE96804 and GSE47183 datasets. The clinical correlation analyses were 
conducted to confirm the association between key genes and clinical 
characteristics in the Nephroseq v5 database. The Drug Gene Interaction Database 
was used to predict potential targeted drugs.
RESULTS: 345 and 1228 DEGs were identified in GSE30528 and GSE1009, 
respectively; and 120 common DEGs were found. The biological process of DEGs was 
significantly enriched in kidney development. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal 
adhesion, complement and coagulation cascades were significantly enriched KEGG 
pathways. The identified top10 hub genes were VEGFA, NPHS1, WT1, TJP1, CTGF, 
FYN, SYNPO, PODXL, TNNT2, and BMP2. VEGFA, NPHS1, WT1, CTGF, SYNPO, PODXL, and 
TNNT2 were significantly downregulated in DN. VEGFA, NPHS1, WT1, CTGF, SYNPO, 
and PODXL were positively correlated with glomerular filtration rate. The 
targeted drugs or molecular compounds were enalapril, sildenafil, and 
fenofibrate target for VEGFA; losartan target for NPHS1; halofuginone, 
deferoxamine, curcumin, and sirolimus target for WT1; and purpurogallin target 
for TNNT2.
CONCLUSIONS: VEGFA, NPHS1, WT1, CTGF, SYNPO, and PODXL are promising biomarkers 
for diagnosing and evaluating the progression of DN. The drug-gene interaction 
analyses provide a list of candidate drugs for the precise treatment of DN.

The standard therapy administered to patients with advanced esophageal cancer 
remains uniform, despite its two main histological subtypes, namely esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (AC), are being 
increasingly considered to be different. The identification of potential drug 
target genes between SCC and AC is crucial for more effective treatment of these 
diseases, given the high toxicity of chemotherapy and resistance to administered 
medications. Herein we attempted to identify and rank differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) in SCC vs. AC using ensemble feature selection methods. RNA-seq 
data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Fudan-Taizhou Institute of Health 
Sciences (China). Six feature filters algorithms were used to identify DEGs. We 
built robust predictive models for histological subtypes with the random forest 
(RF) classification algorithm. Pathway analysis also be performed to investigate 
the functional role of genes. 294 informative DEGs (87 of them are newly 
discovered) have been identified. The areas under receiver operator curve (AUC) 
were higher than 99.5% for all feature selection (FS) methods. Nine genes (i.e., 
ERBB3, ATP7B, ABCC3, GALNT14, CLDN18, GUCY2C, FGFR4, KCNQ5, and CACNA1B) may 
play a key role in the development of more directed anticancer therapy for SCC 
and AC patients. The first four of them are drug targets for chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy of esophageal cancer and involved in pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics pathways. Research identified novel DEGs in SCC and AC, and 
detected four potential drug targeted genes (ERBB3, ATP7B, ABCC3, and GALNT14) 
and five drug-related genes.

Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare subtype of soft tissue sarcoma 
characterized by an unbalanced translocation, resulting in ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion 
that transcriptionally upregulates MET expression. The European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 90101 "CREATE" phase II trial evaluated 
the MET inhibitor crizotinib in ASPS patients, achieving only limited antitumor 
activity. We performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of ASPS tissue samples 
collected in this trial to identify potential biomarkers correlating with 
treatment outcome. A tissue microarray containing 47 ASPS cases was used for the 
characterization of the tumor microenvironment using multiplex 
immunofluorescence. DNA isolated from 34 available tumor samples was analyzed to 
detect recurrent gene copy number alterations (CNAs) and mutations by 
low-coverage whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. Pathway 
enrichment analysis was used to identify diseased-associated pathways in ASPS 
sarcomagenesis. Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox regression, and the Fisher's exact 
test were used to correlate histopathological and molecular findings with 
clinical data related to crizotinib treatment, aiming to identify potential 
factors associated with patient outcome. Tumor microenvironment characterization 
showed the presence of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 in 10 and 2 tumors, respectively, and 
the absence of PD-1 in all specimens. Apart from CD68, other immunological 
markers were rarely expressed, suggesting a low level of tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes in ASPS. By CNA analysis, we detected a number of broad and focal 
alterations. The most common alteration was the loss of chromosomal region 
1p36.32 in 44% of cases. The loss of chromosomal regions 1p36.32, 1p33, 1p22.2, 
and 8p was associated with shorter progression-free survival. Using whole-exome 
sequencing, 13 cancer-associated genes were found to be mutated in at least 
three cases. Pathway enrichment analysis identified genetic alterations in NOTCH 
signaling, chromatin organization, and SUMOylation pathways. NOTCH4 
intracellular domain dysregulation was associated with poor outcome, while 
inactivation of the beta-catenin/TCF complex correlated with improved outcome in 
patients receiving crizotinib. ASPS is characterized by molecular heterogeneity. 
We identify genetic aberrations potentially predictive of treatment outcome 
during crizotinib therapy and provide additional insights into the biology of 
ASPS, paving the way to improve treatment approaches for this extremely rare 
malignancy.

Bioinformatics is an amalgamation of biology, mathematics and computer science. 
It is a science which gathers the information from biology in terms of molecules 
and applies the informatic techniques to the gathered information for 
understanding and organizing the data in a useful manner. With the help of 
bioinformatics, the experimental data generated is stored in several databases 
available online like nucleotide database, protein databases, GENBANK and 
others. The data stored in these databases is used as reference for experimental 
evaluation and validation. Till now several online tools have been developed to 
analyze the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomics, epigenomics and metabolomics 
data. Some of them include Human Splicing Finder (HSF), Exonic Splicing Enhancer 
Mutation taster, and others. A number of SNPs are observed in the non-coding, 
intronic regions and play a role in the regulation of genes, which may or may 
not directly impose an effect on the protein expression. Many mutations are 
thought to influence the splicing mechanism by affecting the existing splice 
sites or creating a new sites. To predict the effect of mutation (SNP) on 
splicing mechanism/signal, HSF was developed. Thus, the tool is helpful in 
predicting the effect of mutations on splicing signals and can provide data even 
for better understanding of the intronic mutations that can be further validated 
experimentally. Additionally, rapid advancement in proteomics have steered 
researchers to organize the study of protein structure, function, relationships, 
and dynamics in space and time. Thus the effective integration of all of these 
technological interventions will eventually lead to steering up of 
next-generation systems biology, which will provide valuable biological insights 
in the field of research, diagnostic, therapeutic and development of 
personalized medicine.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and multifactorial disorder 
with a prevalence ranging between 6-10% in the general population and ~35% in 
individuals with high lifetime trauma exposure. Growing evidence indicates that 
the immune system may contribute to the etiology of PTSD, suggesting the 
inflammatory dysregulation as a hallmark feature of PTSD. However, the potential 
interplay between the central and peripheral immune system, as well as the 
biological mechanisms underlying this dysregulation remain poorly understood. 
The activation of the HPA axis after trauma exposure and the subsequent 
activation of the inflammatory system mediated by glucocorticoids is the most 
common mechanism that orchestrates an exacerbated immunological response in 
PTSD. Recent high-throughput analyses in peripheral and brain tissue from both 
humans with and animal models of PTSD have found that changes in gene regulation 
via epigenetic alterations may participate in the impaired inflammatory 
signaling in PTSD. The goal of this review is to assess the role of the 
inflammatory system in PTSD across tissue and species, with a particular focus 
on the genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics domains. We 
conducted an integrative multi-omics approach identifying TNF (Tumor Necrosis 
Factor) signaling, interleukins, chemokines, Toll-like receptors and 
glucocorticoids among the common dysregulated pathways in both central and 
peripheral immune systems in PTSD and propose potential novel drug targets for 
PTSD treatment.

BACKGROUND: Pyroptosis has been shown to be involved in the overall process of 
atherosclerosis. This study was aimed at investigating pyroptosis-related gene 
expression patterns in atherosclerosis and their diagnostic significance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In GSE100927, fifty-four pyroptosis-related genes were 
identified. Between atherosclerotic plaques and normal samples, the expression 
patterns of pyroptosis-related genes were significantly different. In order to 
construct a pyroptosis-related risk score signature (PRSS), the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was combined with multivariate logistic 
regression to screen twelve genes. The diagnostic efficiency of the PRSS 
performed well in GSE43292, as shown by the results of receiver-operating 
characteristics (ROCs). Consensus clustering identified two expression patterns 
of pyroptosis-related genes in different statuses of atherosclerotic plaque in 
GSE163154. The biological behavior of the different clusters was examined by the 
gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed that the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the two clusters were enriched in the 
immune response. The Cytoscape software was used to construct protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) networks for hub gene screening. Following that, the Drug Gene 
Interaction Database (DGIdb) was utilized to find 47 possible medicines and 
chemical compounds that interact with hub genes in atherosclerotic plaques.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that pyroptosis-related genes 
contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis and may serve as biomarkers in 
clinical diagnosis as well as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of AS.

The molecular determinants of tissue composition of the human brain remain 
largely unknown. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on this topic 
have had limited success due to methodological constraints. Here, we apply 
advanced whole-brain analyses on multi-shell diffusion imaging data and 
multivariate GWAS to two large scale imaging genetic datasets (UK Biobank and 
the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study) to identify and validate 
genetic association signals. We discover 503 unique genetic loci that have 
impact on multiple regions of human brain. Among them, more than 79% are 
validated in either of two large-scale independent imaging datasets. Key 
molecular pathways involved in axonal growth, astrocyte-mediated 
neuroinflammation, and synaptogenesis during development are found to 
significantly impact the measured variations in tissue-specific imaging 
features. Our results shed new light on the biological determinants of brain 
tissue composition and their potential overlap with the genetic basis of 
neuropsychiatric disorders.

BACKGROUND: There is still an unmet need for therapeutic drugs for patients with 
an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), especially for candidates unsuitable for 
surgical or interventional repair. Therefore, the purpose of this in silico 
study is to identify significant genes and regulatory mechanisms in AAA patients 
to predicate the potential therapeutic compounds for significant genes.
METHODS: The GSE57691 dataset was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
and used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and weighted 
correlation network analysis (WGCNA). The biological function of DEGs was 
determined using gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG). AAA-related genes were obtained from the Comparative 
Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) using the keywords: aortic aneurysm and abdominal. 
The hub genes in AAA were obtained by overlapping DEGs, WGCNA-based hub genes, 
and CTD-based genes. The diagnostic values of hub genes were determined using 
ROC curve analysis. Hereby, a TF-miRNA-hub gene network was constructed based on 
the miRnet database. Using these data, potential therapeutic compounds for the 
therapy of AAA were predicted based on the Drug Gene Interaction Database 
(DGIdb).
RESULTS: A total of 218 DEGs (17 upregulated and 201 downregulated) and their 
biological function were explored; 4093 AAA-related genes were derived by text 
mining. Three hub modules and 144 hub genes were identified by WGCNA. asparagine 
synthetase (ASNS), axin-related protein 2 (AXIN2), melanoma cell adhesion 
molecule (MCAM), and the testis-specific Y-encoded-like protein 1 (TSPYL1) were 
obtained as intersecting hub genes and the diagnostic values were confirmed with 
ROC curves. As potential compounds targeting the hub genes, asparaginase was 
identified as the target compound for ASNS. Prednisolone and abiraterone were 
identified as compounds targeting TSPYL1. For MCAM and TSPYL1, no potential 
therapeutic compound could be predicted.
CONCLUSION: Using WGCNA analysis and text mining, pre-existing gene expression 
data were used to provide novel insight into potential AAA-related protein 
targets. For two of these targets, compounds could be predicted.

There is a rapid rise in cases of Type-2-diabetes mellitus (T2DM) globally, 
irrespective of the geography, ethnicity or any other variable factors. The 
molecular mechanisms that could cause the condition of T2DM need to be more 
thoroughly analysed to understand the clinical manifestations and to derive 
better therapeutic regimes. Tools in bioinformatics are used to trace out key 
gene elements and to identify the key causative gene elements and their possible 
therapeutic agents. Microarray datasets were retrieved from the Gene expression 
omnibus database and studied using R to derive different expressed gene (DEG) 
elements. With the comparison of the expressed genes with disease specific genes 
in DisGeNET, the final annotated genes were taken for analysis. Gene Ontology 
studies, Protein-protein interaction (PPI), Co-expression analysis, Gene-drug 
interactions were performed to scale down the hub genes and to identify the 
novelty across the genes analysed so far. In vivo and invitro analysis of key 
genes and the trace of interaction pathway is crucial to better understand the 
unique outcomes from the novel genes, forming the basis to understand the 
pathway that ends up causing T2DM. Afterwards, docking was executed enabling 
recognition of interacting residues involved in inhibition. The complex CCL5-265 
and CD8A-40585 thus docked showed best results as is evident from its PCA 
analysis and MMGBSA calculation. There is now scope for deriving candidate drugs 
that could possibly detect personalized therapies for T2DM.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a monogenic lipid disorder which promotes 
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Owing to the lack of sufficient 
published information, this study aims to identify the potential genetic 
biomarkers for FH by studying the global gene expression profile of blood cells. 
The microarray expression data of FH patients and controls was analyzed by 
different computational biology methods like differential expression analysis, 
protein network mapping, hub gene identification, functional enrichment of 
biological pathways, and immune cell restriction analysis. Our results showed 
the dysregulated expression of 115 genes connected to lipid homeostasis, immune 
responses, cell adhesion molecules, canonical Wnt signaling, mucin type O-glycan 
biosynthesis pathways in FH patients. The findings from expanded protein 
interaction network construction with known FH genes and subsequent Gene 
Ontology (GO) annotations have also supported the above findings, in addition to 
identifying the involvement of dysregulated thyroid hormone and ErbB signaling 
pathways in FH patients. The genes like CSNK1A1, JAK3, PLCG2, RALA, and ZEB2 
were found to be enriched under all GO annotation categories. The subsequent 
phenotype ontology results have revealed JAK3I, PLCG2, and ZEB2 as key hub genes 
contributing to the inflammation underlying cardiovascular and immune response 
related phenotypes. Immune cell restriction findings show that above three genes 
are highly expressed by T-follicular helper CD4+ T cells, naïve B cells, and 
monocytes, respectively. These findings not only provide a theoretical basis to 
understand the role of immune dysregulations underlying the atherosclerosis 
among FH patients but may also pave the way to develop genomic medicine for 
cardiovascular diseases.

Immune-associated biomarkers can predict lung metastases from colorectal cancer. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from sample data extracted 
from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. The DEGs were screened from the 
lung metastasis (LM) and primary cancer (PC) groups of the Moffitt Cancer Center 
cohort dataset. Then, the tumor immune microenvironment and abundance of immune 
cell infiltration analyses were performed, and the immune-related DEGs were 
retrieved. In addition, the transcription factor (TF)-miRNA-mRNA network was 
constructed and enrichment analyses of the immune-related DEGs and upregulated 
and downregulated DEGs were carried out. Then, the protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network was conducted and the drug-gene interaction was predicted. A total 
of 268 DEGs were screened. The Immune_Score of samples in the LM group was 
significantly higher compared with the PC group. The infiltration ratio of M0 
macrophages and M2 macrophages of samples was higher than others. A total of 54 
immune-related DEGs in M0 macrophages were screened. Moreover, the TF-miRNA-mRNA 
network was constructed among 8 miRNA-mRNA and 50 TF-mRNA, and the secreted 
phosphoprotein 1 was regulated by 12 TFs, and the oxidized low-density 
lipoprotein receptor 1 was regulated by 3 miRNAs and 3 TFs. The TF SAM pointed 
domain containing ETS TF was also a downregulated DEG. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that the DEGs in the TF-miRNA-mRNA 
network were mainly involved in the interleukin-7 signaling pathway and cell 
adhesion molecules. In total, 23 protein interactions in this PPI network of M0 
macrophage cells were involved in 27 mRNAs. There were 38 drug-gene interactions 
of immune-related DEGs of M0 macrophage cells predicted to contain 34 small 
molecule drugs and 8 mRNAs. Finally, the CON cohort dataset verified that the 
infiltration ratio of M0 and M2 macrophages of the samples was higher.

Patellar instability (PI) is a common knee injury in adolescents, but the 
crucial biomarkers and molecular mechanisms associated with it remain unclear. 
We established a PI mouse model and investigated PI-related changes in gene 
expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) 
analysis and enrichment analysis were performed to identify crucial genes and 
pathways associated with PI. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction, 
DEG-miRNA, DEG-transcription factors, and DEG-drug interaction networks were 
constructed to reveal hub genes, molecular mechanism, and potential drugs for 
PI. Finally, the reliability of the sequencing results was confirmed by 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and 
immunohistochemistry. Upon comparison with the control group, 69 genes were 
differently expressed in PI, including 17 upregulated and 52 downregulated ones. 
The DEGs were significantly enriched in Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and 
activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway and immune responses. The 
protein-protein interaction network identified ten PI-related hub genes, all of 
which are involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway or inflammation-related 
pathways. DEG-miRNA and DEG-transcription factor networks offered new insights 
for regulating DEGs post-transcriptionally. We also determined potential 
therapeutic drugs or molecular compounds that could restore dysregulated 
expression of DEGs via the DGIdb database. RT-qPCR results were consistent with 
the RNA-seq, confirming the reliability of the sequencing data. 
Immunohistochemistry results suggested that JAK1 and STAT3 expression was 
increased in PI. Our study explored the potential molecular mechanisms in PI, 
provided promising biomarkers and suggested a molecular basis for therapeutic 
targets for this condition.

Adenomatous polyps of the colon are the most common neoplastic polyps. Although 
most of adenomatous polyps do not show malign transformation, majority of 
colorectal carcinomas originate from neoplastic polyps. Therefore, understanding 
of this transformation process would help in both preventive therapies and 
evaluation of malignancy risks. This study uncovers alterations in gene 
expressions as potential biomarkers that are revealed by integration of several 
network-based approaches. In silico analysis performed on a unified microarray 
cohort, which is covering 150 normal colon and adenomatous polyp samples. 
Significant gene modules were obtained by a weighted gene co-expression network 
analysis. Gene modules with similar profiles were mapped to a colon tissue 
specific functional interaction network. Several clustering algorithms run on 
the colon-specific network and the most significant sub-modules between the 
clusters were identified. The biomarkers were selected by filtering 
differentially expressed genes which also involve in significant biological 
processes and pathways. Biomarkers were also validated on two independent 
datasets based on their differential gene expressions. To the best of our 
knowledge, such a cascaded network analysis pipeline was implemented for the 
first time on a large collection of normal colon and polyp samples. We 
identified significant increases in TLR4 and MSX1 expressions as well as 
decrease in chemokine profiles with mostly pro-tumoral activities. These 
biomarkers might appear as both preventive targets and biomarkers for risk 
evaluation. As a result, this research proposes novel molecular markers that 
might be alternative to endoscopic approaches for diagnosis of adenomatous 
polyps.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical in the development of 
coronary artery disease (CAD). However, landscapes of EMT-related genes have not 
been fully established in CAD. We identified the differentially expressed mRNAs 
and lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Pearson's 
correlation analysis, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
regression, and support vector machine reverse feature elimination algorithms 
were used to screen EMT-related lncRNAs. The cis-trans regulatory networks were 
constructed based on EMT-related lncRNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction was performed to validate the expression of EMT-related genes in 
a cohort of six patients with CAD and six healthy controls. We further estimated 
the infiltration of the immune cells in CAD patients with five algorithms, and 
the correlation between EMT-related genes and infiltrating immune cells was 
analyzed. We identified eight EMT-related lncRNAs in CAD. The area under curve 
value was greater than 0.95. The immune analysis revealed significant CD8 T 
cells, monocytes, and NK cells in CAD and found that EMT-related lncRNAs were 
correlated with these immune cell subsets. Moreover, SNAI2, an EMT-TF gene, was 
found in the trans-regulatory network of EMT-related lncRNAs. Further, we found 
SNAI2 as a biomarker for the diagnosis of CAD but it also had a close 
correlation with immune cell subsets in CAD. Eight EMT-related lncRNAs and SNAI2 
have important significance in the diagnosis of CAD patients.

Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is one of the most malignant and aggressive forms 
of cancer. Investigating the mechanisms of carcinogenesis further could lead to 
the discovery of prognostic biomarkers that could be used to guide cancer 
treatment. In this study, we conducted integrative bioinformatics analyses of 
TCGA database, STRING, cBioPortal, TRRUST, The Human Protein Atlas, and DGIdb to 
determine which hub genes contributed to tumor progression and the 
cancer-associated immunology of SKCM. The results show that immune-related 873 
differential genes grouped SKCM samples into subtypes. The initial results 
showed that the optimal number of clusters was two subgroups. Further analysis 
showed that there were significant differences in survival rate and immune 
infiltration level between the two subgroups. Subsequently, obtaining the 
different genes between groups, construct PPI to screen 6 hub genes (HLA-DPA1, 
HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5). In total, 6 MHC class II 
molecules were significantly related to overall survival. We then analyzed the 
expression of these genes along with their mutation landscapes, transcription 
factor regulation, and drug regulatory networks. In summary, our study 
identified 6 MHC class II molecules (HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRA, 
HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5) as important biomarkers in the occurrence and progression of 
SKCM tumors. Their expression levels are closely related to prognosis and immune 
infiltration and can help us better understand the tumorigenesis of SKCM.

The origins of pharmacogenetics date back to the 1950s, when it was established 
that inter-individual differences in drug response are partially determined by 
genetic factors. Since then, pharmacogenetics has grown into its own field, 
motivated by the translation of identified gene-drug interactions into 
therapeutic applications. Despite numerous challenges ahead, our understanding 
of the human pharmacogenetic landscape has greatly improved thanks to the 
integration of tools originating from disciplines as diverse as biochemistry, 
molecular biology, statistics, and computer sciences. In this review, we discuss 
past, present, and future developments of pharmacogenetics methodology, focusing 
on three milestones: how early research established the genetic basis of drug 
responses, how technological progress made it possible to assess the full extent 
of pharmacological variants, and how multi-dimensional omics datasets can 
improve the identification, functional validation, and mechanistic understanding 
of the interplay between genes and drugs. We outline novel strategies to 
repurpose and integrate molecular and clinical data originating from biobanks to 
gain insights analogous to those obtained from randomized controlled trials. 
Emphasizing the importance of increased diversity, we envision future directions 
for the field that should pave the way to the clinical implementation of 
pharmacogenetics.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is one of the two categories of inflammatory bowel 
diseases that affect the gastrointestinal tract. The heritability estimate has 
been reported to be 0.75. Several genes linked to Crohn's disease risk have been 
identified using a plethora of strategies such as linkage-based studies, 
candidate gene association studies, and lately through genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, a compendium of all the genes 
that have been associated with CD is lacking.
METHODS: We conducted functional analyses of a gene set generated from a 
systematic review where genes potentially related to CD found in the literature 
were analyzed and classified depending on the genetic evidence reported and 
putative biological function. For this, we retrieved and analyzed 2496 abstracts 
comprising 1067 human genes plus 22 publications regarding 133 genes from GWAS 
Catalog. Then, each gene was curated and categorized according to the type of 
evidence associated with Crohn's disease.
RESULTS: We identified 126 genes associated with Crohn's disease risk by 
specific experiments. Additionally, 71 genes were recognized associated through 
GWAS alone, 18 to treatment response, 41 to disease complications, and 81 to 
related diseases. Bioinformatic analysis of the 126 genes supports their 
importance in Crohn's disease and highlights genes associated with specific 
aspects such as symptoms, drugs, and comorbidities. Importantly, most genes were 
not included in commercial genetic panels suggesting that Crohn's disease is 
genetically underdiagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a total of 126 genes from PubMed and 71 from GWAS 
that showed evidence of association to diagnosis, 18 to treatment response, and 
41 to disease complications in Crohn's disease. This prioritized gene catalog 
can be explored at http://victortrevino.bioinformatics.mx/CrohnDisease .

Linkage disequilibrium and disease-associated variants in the non-coding regions 
make it difficult to distinguish the truly associated genes from the redundantly 
associated genes for complex diseases. In this study, we proposed a new 
conditional gene-based framework called eDESE that leveraged an improved 
effective chi-squared statistic to control the type I error rates and remove the 
redundant associations. eDESE initially performed the association analysis by 
mapping variants to genes according to their physical distance. We further 
demonstrated that the isoform-level eQTLs could be more powerful than the 
gene-level eQTLs in the association analysis using a simulation study. Then the 
eQTL-guided strategies, that is, mapping variants to genes according to their 
gene/isoform-level variant-gene cis-eQTLs associations, were also integrated 
with eDESE. We then applied eDESE to predict the potential susceptibility genes 
of schizophrenia and found that the potential susceptibility genes were enriched 
with many neuronal or synaptic signaling-related terms in the Gene Ontology 
knowledgebase and antipsychotics-gene interaction terms in the drug-gene 
interaction database (DGIdb). More importantly, seven potential susceptibility 
genes identified by eDESE were the target genes of multiple antipsychotics in 
DrugBank. Comparing the potential susceptibility genes identified by eDESE and 
other benchmark approaches (i.e., MAGMA and S-PrediXcan) implied that strategy 
based on the isoform-level eQTLs could be an important supplement for the other 
two strategies (physical distance and gene-level eQTLs). We have implemented 
eDESE in our integrative platform KGGSEE (http://pmglab.top/kggsee/#/) and hope 
that eDESE can facilitate the prediction of candidate susceptibility genes and 
isoforms for complex diseases in a multi-tissue context.

Current strategies to target RNA splicing mutant myeloid cancers proposes 
targeting the remaining splicing apparatus. This approach has only been modestly 
sensitizing and is also toxic to non-mutant-bearing wild-type cells. To explore 
potentially exploitable genetic interactions with spliceosome mutations, we 
combined data mining and functional screening for synthetic lethal interactions 
with an Srsf2P95H/+ mutation. Analysis of missplicing events in a series of both 
human and murine SRSF2P95H mutant samples across multiple myeloid diseases 
(acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia) was performed to identify conserved missplicing events. From this 
analysis, we identified that the cell-cycle and DNA repair pathways were 
overrepresented within the conserved misspliced transcript sets. In parallel, to 
functionally define pathways essential for survival and proliferation of 
Srsf2P95H/+ cells, we performed a genome-wide Clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeat loss-of-function screen using Hoxb8 immortalized 
R26-CreERki/+Srsf2P95H/+ and R26-CreERki/+Srsf2+/+ cell lines. We assessed loss 
of single guide RNA representation at 3 timepoints: immediately after 
Srsf2P95H/+ activation, and at 1 week and 2 weeks after Srsf2P95H/+ mutation. 
Pathway analysis demonstrated that the cell-cycle and DNA damage response 
pathways were among the top synthetic lethal pathways with Srsf2P95H/+ mutation. 
Based on the loss of guide RNAs targeting Cdk6, we identified that palbociclib, 
a CDK6 inhibitor, showed preferential sensitivity in Srsf2P95H/+ cell lines and 
in primary nonimmortalized lin-cKIT+Sca-1+ cells compared with wild-type 
controls. Our data strongly suggest that the cell-cycle and DNA damage response 
pathways are required for Srsf2P95H/+ cell survival, and that palbociclib could 
be an alternative therapeutic option for targeting SRSF2 mutant cancers.

Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most important cancers worldwide, and if it is 
diagnosed early, its progression in humans can be prevented and long-term 
survival will be achieved accordingly. This study aimed to identify novel 
micro-RNA (miRNA) and gene-based biomarkers for diagnosing BC. The microarray 
dataset of BC tissues (GSE13507) listed in the GEO database was analyzed for 
this purpose. The gene expression data from three BC tissues including 165 
primary bladder cancer (PBC), 58 normal looking-bladder mucosae surrounding 
cancer (NBMSC), and 23 recurrent non-muscle invasive tumor tissues (RNIT) were 
used to reconstruct gene co-expression networks. After preprocessing and 
normalization, deferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained and used to 
construct the weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA). Gene co-expression 
modules and low-preserved modules were extracted among BC tissues using network 
clustering. Next, the experimentally validated mRNA-miRNA interaction 
information were used to reconstruct three mRNA-miRNA bipartite networks. 
Reactome pathway database and Gene ontology (GO) was subsequently performed for 
the extracted genes of three bipartite networks and miRNAs, respectively. To 
further analyze the data, ten hub miRNAs (miRNAs with the highest degree) were 
selected in each bipartite network to reconstruct three bipartite subnetworks. 
Finally, the obtained biomarkers were comprehensively investigated and discussed 
in authentic studies. The obtained results from our study indicated a group of 
genes including PPARD, CST4, CSNK1E, PTPN14, ETV6, and ADRM1 as well as novel 
miRNAs (e.g., miR-16-5p, miR-335-5p, miR-124-3p, and let-7b-5p) which might be 
potentially associated with BC and could be a potential biomarker. Afterward, 
three drug-gene interaction networks were reconstructed to explore candidate 
drugs for the treatment of BC. The hub miRNAs in the mRNA-miRNA bipartite 
network played a fundamental role in BC progression; however, these findings 
need further investigation.

Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a highly aggressive soft tissue 
sarcoma that is characterized by the EWSR1-WT1 fusion protein. Patients present 
with hundreds of tumor implants in their abdominal cavity at various sites. To 
determine the genetic relatedness among these sites, exome and RNA sequencing 
were performed on 22 DSRCT specimens from 14 patients, four of whom had 
specimens from various tissue sites. Multi-site tumors from individual DSRCT 
patients had a shared origin and were highly related. Other than the EWSR1-WT1 
fusion, very few secondary cancer gene mutations were shared among the sites. 
Among these, ARID1A, was recurrently mutated, which corroborates findings by 
others in DSRCT patients. Knocking out ARID1A in JN-DSRCT cells using 
CRISPR/CAS9 resulted in significantly lower cell proliferation and increased 
drug sensitivity. The transcriptome data were integrated using network analysis 
and drug target database information to identify potential therapeutic 
opportunities in EWSR1-WT1-associated pathways, such as PI3K and mTOR pathways. 
Treatment of JN-DSRCT cells with the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib and mTOR inhibitor 
temsirolimus reduced cell proliferation. In addition, the low mutation burden 
was associated with an immune-cold state in DSRCT. Together, these data reveal 
multiple genomic and immune features of DSRCT and suggest therapeutic 
opportunities in patients.

Pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, that plays a significant role in 
the occurrence and progression of tumors, has been frequently investigated 
recently. However, the prognostic significance and therapeutic value of 
pyroptosis in glioma remain undetermined. In this research, we revealed the 
relationship of pyroptosis-related genes to glioma by analyzing whole 
transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset serving as the 
training set and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) dataset serving as the 
validation set. We identified two subgroups of glioma patients with disparate 
prognostic and clinical features by performing consensus clustering analysis on 
nineteen pyroptosis-related genes that were differentially expressed between 
glioma and normal brain tissues. We further derived a risk signature, using 
eleven pyroptosis-related genes, that was demonstrated to be an independent 
prognostic factor for glioma. Furthermore, we used Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to implement functional analysis of our 
gene set, and the results were closely related to immune and inflammatory 
responses in accordance with the characteristics of pyroptosis. Moreover, Gene 
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) results showed that that the high-risk group 
exhibited enriched characteristics of malignant tumors in accordance with its 
poor prognosis. Next, we analyzed different immune cell infiltration between the 
two risk groups using ssGSEA. Finally, CASP1 was identified as a core gene, so 
we subsequently selected an inhibitor targeting CASP1 and simulated molecular 
docking. In addition, the inhibitory effect of belnacasan on glioma was verified 
at the cellular level. In conclusion, pyroptosis-related genes are of great 
significance for performing prognostic stratification and developing treatment 
strategies for glioma.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth cause of cancer-related mortality 
worldwide. While many targeted therapies have been developed, the majority of 
HCC tumors do not harbor clinically actionable mutations. Protein-level 
aberrations, especially those not evident at the genomic level, present 
therapeutic opportunities but have rarely been systematically characterized in 
HCC. In this study, we performed proteogenomic analyses of 260 primary tumors 
from two HBV-related HCC patient cohorts with global mass-spectrometry (MS) 
proteomics data. Combining tumor-normal and inter-tumor analyses, we identified 
overexpressed targets including PDGFRB, FGFR4, ERBB2/3, CDK6 kinases and MFAP5, 
HMCN1, and Hsp proteins in HCC, many of which showed low frequencies of genomic 
and/or transcriptomic aberrations. Protein expression of FGFR4 kinase and Hsp 
proteins were significantly associated with response to their corresponding 
inhibitors. Our results provide a catalog of protein targets in HCC and 
demonstrate the potential of proteomics approaches in advancing precision 
medicine in cancer types lacking druggable mutations.

There have been no new drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia in several 
decades and treatment resistance represents a major unmet clinical need. The 
drugs that exist are based on serendipitous clinical observations rather than an 
evidence-based understanding of disease pathophysiology. In the present review, 
we address these bottlenecks by integrating common, rare, and expression-related 
schizophrenia risk genes with knowledge of the druggability of the human genome 
as a whole. We highlight novel drug repurposing opportunities, clinical trial 
candidates which are supported by genetic evidence, and unexplored therapeutic 
opportunities in the lesser-known regions of the schizophrenia genome. By 
identifying translational gaps and opportunities across the schizophrenia 
disease space, we discuss a framework for translating increasingly well-powered 
genetic association studies into personalized treatments for schizophrenia and 
initiating the vital task of characterizing clinically relevant drug targets in 
underexplored regions of the human genome.

Background: The current medical treatments for connective tissue 
disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (CTD-PAH) do not show 
favorable efficiency for all patients, and identification of novel drugs is 
desired. Methods: Text mining was performed to obtain CTD- and PAH-related gene 
sets, and the intersection of the two gene sets was analyzed for functional 
enrichment through DAVID. The protein-protein interaction network of the 
overlapping genes and the significant gene modules were determined using STRING. 
The enriched candidate genes were further analyzed by Drug Gene Interaction 
database to identify drugs with potential therapeutic effects on CTD-PAH. 
Results: Based on text mining analysis, 179 genes related to CTD and PAH were 
identified. Through enrichment analysis of the genes, 20 genes representing six 
pathways were obtained. To further narrow the scope of potential existing drugs, 
we selected targeted drugs with a Query Score ≥5 and Interaction Score ≥1. 
Finally, 13 drugs targeting the six genes were selected as candidate drugs, 
which were divided into four drug-gene interaction types, and 12 of them had 
initial drug indications approved by the FDA. The potential gene targets of the 
drugs on this list are IL-6 (one drug) and IL-1β (two drugs), MMP9 (one drug), 
VEGFA (three drugs), TGFB1 (one drug), and EGFR (five drugs). These drugs might 
be used to treat CTD-PAH. Conclusion: We identified 13 drugs targeting six genes 
that may have potential therapeutic effects on CTD-PAH.

The cleavage stimulation factor subunit complex is involved in the cleavage and 
polyadenylation of 3'-end pre-mRNAs that regulate mRNA formation and processing. 
However, cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 (CSTF2) was found to play a more 
critical regulatory role across cancers. General cancer data sets from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression project were thus downloaded 
for differential analysis, and the possible functions and mechanisms of CSTF2 in 
general cancer were analyzed using the Compartments database, cBioPortal 
database, Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub database, and Comparative Toxigenomics 
database using gene set enrichment analysis and R software. The results showed 
that CSTF2 could affect DNA repair and methylation in tumor cells. In addition, 
CSTF2 was associated with multiple tumor immune infiltrates in a wide range of 
cancers, and its high expression was associated with multiple immune 
checkpoints; therefore, it could serve as a potential target for many drug 
molecules. We also proved that CSTF2 promotes oral cell proliferation and 
migration. The high diagnostic efficacy of CSTF2 suggested that this gene may 
act as a new biomarker and personalized therapeutic target for a variety of 
tumors.

Myeloid neoplasms are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders driven by the 
sequential acquisition of recurrent genetic lesions. Truncating mutations in the 
chromatin remodeler ASXL1 (ASXL1MT) are associated with a high-risk disease 
phenotype with increased proliferation, epigenetic therapeutic resistance, and 
poor survival outcomes. We performed a multi-omics interrogation to define gene 
expression and chromatin remodeling associated with ASXL1MT in chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). ASXL1MT are associated with a loss of repressive 
histone methylation and increase in permissive histone methylation and 
acetylation in promoter regions. ASXL1MT are further associated with de novo 
accessibility of distal enhancers binding ETS transcription factors, targeting 
important leukemogenic driver genes. Chromatin remodeling of promoters and 
enhancers is strongly associated with gene expression and heterogenous among 
overexpressed genes. These results provide a comprehensive map of the 
transcriptome and chromatin landscape of ASXL1MT CMML, forming an important 
framework for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting 
oncogenic cis interactions.

Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is one of the most common cancers with 
high mortality worldwide. As members of the homeobox (HOX) family, homeobox-A 
(HOXA) genes have been reported to play an increasingly important role in 
tumorigenesis and the progression of multiple cancers. However, limited studies 
have investigated the potential diagnostic and prognostic roles of HOXA genes in 
KIRC. In this research, we explored the expression pattern of the HOXA gene 
family in KIRC progression by differential analysis of expression profiles from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). By using univariate Cox analysis and lasso 
regression analysis, we comprehensively evaluated the prognostic value of HOXA 
genes and eventually identified a prognostic risk model consisting of five HOXA 
genes (HOXA2, HOXA3, HOXA7, HOXA11, and HOXA13). The risk model was further 
validated as a novel independent prognostic factor for KIRC patients based on 
the calculated risk score by Kaplan-Meier analysis, univariate and multivariate 
Cox regression analyses, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis. Moreover, to explore the potential mechanism of 
tumorigenesis and clinical application of KIRC, we also developed the HOXA-based 
competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network and machine learning 
classification model. Valproic acid and tretinoin were predicted to be the most 
promising small molecules to adjuvant treatment of KIRC by mining the CMAP and 
DGIdb drug database. Subsequently, pathway and functional enrichment analyses 
provided us with new ways to search for a possible mechanism of action of drugs. 
Taken together, our study demonstrated the nonnegligible role of HOXA genes in 
KIRC and constructed an effective prognostic and diagnostic model, which offers 
novel insights into KIRC prognosis.

PURPOSE: This study is aimed at systematically analyzing the expression, 
function, and prognostic value of six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the 
prostate 1 (STEAP1) in various cancers.
METHODS: The expressions of STEAP1 between normal and tumor tissues were 
analyzed using TCGA and GTEx. Clinicopathologic data was collected from GEPIA 
and TCGA. Prognostic analysis was conducted by Cox proportional hazard 
regression and Kaplan-Meier survival. DNA methylation, mutation features, and 
molecular subtypes of cancers were also investigated. The top-100 coexpressed 
genes with STEAP1 were involved in functional enrichment analysis. ESTIMATE 
algorithm was used to analyze the correlation between STEAP1 and immunity value. 
The relationships of STEAP1 and biomarkers including tumor mutational burden 
(TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and stemness score as well as 
chemosensitivity were also illustrated.
RESULTS: Among 33 cancers, STEAP1 was overexpressed in 19 cancers such as 
cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), colon 
adenocarcinoma, and lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B cell lymphoma while was 
downregulated in 5 cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma, breast invasive 
carcinoma (BRCA), and kidney chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. STEAP1 has 
significant prognostic relationships in multiple cancers. 15 cancers exhibited 
differences of DNA methylation including bladder urothelial carcinoma, BRCA, and 
CESC. STEAP1 expression was positively correlated to immune molecules especially 
in thyroid carcinoma and negatively especially in uveal melanoma. STEAP1 was 
associated with TMB and MSI in certain cancers. In addition, STEAP1 was 
connected with increased chemosensitivity of drugs such as trametinib and 
pimasertib.
CONCLUSIONS: STEAP1 was an underlying target for prognostic prediction in 
different cancer types and a potential biomarker of TMB, MSI, tumor 
microenvironment, and chemosensitivity.

Protein interaction pathways and networks are critically-required for a vast 
range of biological processes. Improved discovery of candidate druggable 
proteins within specific cell, tissue and disease contexts will aid development 
of new treatments. Predicting protein interaction networks from gene expression 
data can provide valuable insights into normal and disease biology. For example, 
the resulting protein networks can be used to identify potentially druggable 
targets and drug candidates for testing in cell and animal disease models. The 
advent of whole-transcriptome expression profiling techniques-that catalogue 
protein-coding genes expressed within cells and tissues-has enabled development 
of individual algorithms for particular tasks. For example,: (i) gene ontology 
algorithms that predict gene/protein subsets involved in related cell processes; 
(ii) algorithms that predict intracellular protein interaction pathways; and 
(iii) algorithms that correlate druggable protein targets with known drugs 
and/or drug candidates. This review examines approaches, advantages and 
disadvantages of existing gene expression, gene ontology, and protein network 
prediction algorithms. Using this framework, we examine current efforts to 
combine these algorithms into pipelines to enable identification of druggable 
targets, and associated known drugs, using gene expression datasets. In doing 
so, new opportunities are identified for development of powerful algorithm 
pipelines, suitable for wide use by non-bioinformaticians, that can predict 
protein interaction networks, druggable proteins, and related drugs from user 
gene expression datasets.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the shared mechanism and candidate drugs 
of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Sjögren's syndrome (SS).
METHODS: MS- and SS-related susceptibility genes and differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were identified by bioinformatics analysis based on genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome data from GWAS catalog and Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway enrichment, Gene Ontology (GO) 
analysis, and protein-protein interaction analysis for susceptibility genes and 
DEGs were performed. The drugs targeting common pathways/genes were obtained 
through Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), DrugBank database, and 
Drug-Gene Interaction (DGI) Database. The target genes of 
approved/investigational drugs for MS and SS were obtained through DrugBank and 
compared with the common susceptibility genes.
RESULTS: Based on GWAS data, we found 14 hub common susceptibility genes 
(HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRA, STAT3, JAK1, HLA-B, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, TYK2, IL2RA, and MAPK1), with 8 drugs targeting two or more 
than two genes, and 28 common susceptibility pathways, with 15 drugs targeting 
three or more than three pathways. Based on transcriptome data, we found 3 hub 
common DEGs (STAT1, GATA3, PIK3CA) with 3 drugs and 10 common risk pathways with 
435 drugs. "JAK-STAT signaling pathway" was included in common susceptibility 
pathways and common risk pathways at the same time. There were 133 overlaps 
including JAK-STAT inhibitors between agents from GWAS and transcriptome data. 
Besides, we found that IL2RA and HLA-DRB1, identified as hub common 
susceptibility genes, were the targets of daclizumab and glatiramer that were 
used for MS, indicating that daclizumab and glatiramer may be therapeutic for 
SS.
CONCLUSION: We observed the shared mechanism of MS and SS, in which JAK-STAT 
signaling pathway played a vital role, which may be the genetic and molecular 
bases of comorbidity of MS with SS. Moreover, JAK-STAT inhibitors were potential 
therapies for MS and SS, especially for their comorbidity.

PURPOSE: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a result of trauma exposure 
and is related to psychological suffering as a long-lasting health issue. 
Further analysis of the networks and genes involved in PTSD are critical to the 
molecular mechanisms of PTSD.
METHODS: In this study, we aimed to identify key genes and molecular interaction 
networks involved in the pathogenesis of PTSD by integrating mRNA and miRNA 
data.
RESULTS: By integrating three high-throughput datasets, 5606 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, including five differentially expressed 
miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 5525 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs). Nineteen 
upregulated and 46 downregulated DEmRNAs were identified in both GSE64813 and 
GSE89866 datasets, while five upregulated DEmiRNAs were found in the GSE87768 
dataset. Functional annotations of these DEmRNAs indicated that they were mainly 
enriched in blood coagulation, cell adhesion, platelet activation, and 
extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. Integrated protein-protein and 
miRNA-protein interaction networks among the DEGs were established with the help 
of 65 nodes and 121 interactions. Finally, 286 small molecules were obtained 
based on the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb). Three genes, 
prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1), beta-tubulin gene (TUBB1), and 
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), were the most promising targets 
for PTSD therapy. Additionally, the present study also provided a higher 
performance diagnostic model for PTSD based on 17 DEmRNAs, which was validated 
in two independent datasets, GSE109409 and GSE63878.
CONCLUSION: Our data provides a new molecular aspect that ECM-receptor 
interaction and the platelet activation process could be the potential molecular 
mechanism of PTSD, and the genes involved in this process may be promising 
therapeutic targets. A higher-performance diagnostic model for PTSD has also 
been identified.

Xerostomia (subjective complaint of dry mouth) is commonly associated with 
salivary gland hypofunction. Molecular mechanisms associated with xerostomia 
pathobiology are poorly understood, thus hampering drug development. Our 
objectives were to (i) use text-mining tools to investigate xerostomia and dry 
mouth concepts, (ii) identify associated molecular interactions involving genes 
as candidate drug targets, and (iii) determine how drugs currently used in 
clinical trials may impact these genes and associated pathways. PubMed and 
PubMed Central were used to identify search terms associated with xerostomia 
and/or dry mouth. Search terms were queried in pubmed2ensembl. Protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) networks were determined using the gene/protein network 
visualization program search tool for recurring instances of neighboring genes 
(STRING). A similar program, Cytoscape, was used to determine PPIs of 
overlapping gene sets. The drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb) and the 
clinicaltrials.gov database were used to identify potential drug targets from 
the xerostomia/dry mouth PPI gene set. We identified 64 search terms in common 
between xerostomia and dry mouth. STRING confirmed PPIs between identified genes 
(CL = 0.90). Cytoscape analysis determined 58 shared genes, with 
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction representing the most significant pathway 
(p = 1.29 × 10-23) found in the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG). 
Fifty-four genes in common had drug interactions, per DGIdb analysis. Eighteen 
drugs, targeting the xerostomia/dry mouth PPI network, have been evaluated for 
xerostomia, head and neck cancer oral complications, and Sjögren's Syndrome. The 
PPI network genes IL6R, EGFR, NFKB1, MPO, and TNFSF13B constitute a possible 
biomarker signature of xerostomia. Validation of the candidate biomarkers is 
necessary to better stratify patients at the genetic and molecular levels to 
facilitate drug development or to monitor response to treatment.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a multifactorial disorder, which is partly 
heritable. Herein, we implemented a mapping of CAD-associated candidate genes by 
using genome-wide enhancer-promoter conformation (H3K27ac-HiChIP) and expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Enhancer-promoter anchor loops from human 
coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) explained 22% of the heritability 
for CAD. 3D enhancer-promoter genome mapping of CAD-genes in HCASMC was enriched 
in vascular eQTL genes. By using colocalization and Mendelian randomization 
analyses, we identified 58 causal candidate vascular genes including some 
druggable targets (MAP3K11, CAMK1D, PDGFD, IPO9 and CETP). A network analysis of 
causal candidate genes was enriched in TGF beta and MAPK pathways. The 
pharmacologic inhibition of causal candidate gene MAP3K11 in vascular SMC 
reduced the expression of athero-relevant genes and lowered cell migration, a 
cardinal process in CAD. Genes connected to enhancers are enriched in vascular 
eQTL and druggable genes causally associated with CAD.

In response to vascular injury vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) alternate 
between a differentiated (contractile) and a dedifferentiated (synthetic) state 
or phenotype. Although parts of the signaling cascade regulating the phenotypic 
switch have been described, the role of miRNAs is still incompletely understood. 
To systematically address this issue, we have established a microscopy-based 
quantitative assay and identified 23 miRNAs that induced contractile phenotypes 
when over-expressed. These were then correlated to miRNAs identified from 
RNA-sequencing when comparing cells in the contractile and synthetic states. 
Using both approaches, six miRNAs (miR-132-3p, miR-138-5p, miR-141-3p, 
miR-145-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-22-3p) were filtered as candidates that induce 
the phenotypic switch from synthetic to contractile. To identify potentially 
common regulatory mechanisms of these six miRNAs, their predicted targets were 
compared with five miRNAs sharing ZBTB20, ZNF704, and EIF4EBP2 as common 
potential targets and four miRNAs sharing 16 common potential targets. The 
interaction network consisting of these 19 targets and additional 18 hub targets 
were created to facilitate validation of miRNA-mRNA interactions by suggesting 
the most plausible pairs. Furthermore, the information on drug candidates was 
integrated into the network to predict novel combinatorial therapies that 
encompass the complexity of miRNAs-mediated regulation. This is the first study 
that combines a phenotypic screening approach with RNA sequencing and 
bioinformatics to systematically identify miRNA-mediated pathways and to detect 
potential drug candidates to positively influence the phenotypic switch of 
VSMCs.

Understanding the mechanisms of tissue-specific transcriptional regulation is 
crucial as mis-regulation can cause a broad range of diseases. Here, we 
investigated transcription factors (TF) that are indispensable for the 
topological control of tissue specific and cell-type specific regulatory 
networks as a function of their binding to regulatory elements on promoters and 
enhancers of corresponding target genes. In particular, we found that 
promoter-binding TFs that were indispensable for regulatory network control 
regulate genes that are tissue-specifically expressed and overexpressed in 
corresponding cancer types. In turn, indispensable, enhancer-binding TFs were 
enriched with disease and signaling genes as they control an increasing number 
of cell-type specific regulatory networks. Their target genes were cell-type 
specific for blood and immune-related cell-types and over-expressed in 
blood-related cancers. Notably, target genes of indispensable enhancer-binding 
TFs in cell-type specific regulatory networks were enriched with cancer drug 
targets, while target genes of indispensable promoter-binding TFs were bona-fide 
targets of cancer drugs in corresponding tissues. Our results emphasize the 
significant role control analysis of regulatory networks plays in our 
understanding of transcriptional regulation, demonstrating potential therapeutic 
implications in tissue-specific drug discovery research.

Neuropathic pain (NP) involves metabolic processes that are regulated by 
metabolic genes and their non-coding regulator genes such as microRNAs (miRNAs). 
Here, we aimed at exploring the key miRNA signatures regulating metabolic genes 
involved in NP pathogenesis. We downloaded NP-related data from public databases 
and identified differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs through 
differential gene expression analysis. The miRNA target prediction was 
performed, and integration with the differentially expressed metabolic genes 
(DEMGs) was used for constructing the miRNA-DEMG network. Subsequently, 
functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis 
were performed to explore the role of DEMGs in the regulatory network. The drug 
prediction was performed based on the DEMGs in the miRNA-DEMG network. A total 
of 8251 differentially expressed mRNAs (4193 upregulated and 4058 
downregulated), and 959 differentially expressed miRNAs (455 upregulated and 504 
downregulated) were identified. Moreover, after target gene prediction, a 
miRNA-DEMG network composed of 22 miRNAs and 113 mRNAs was constructed. The 
network was constituted of 135 nodes and 236 edges. We found that DEMGs in the 
network were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways and metabolic processes. A 
total of 1200 drugs were predicted as potential therapeutics for NP based on the 
differentially expressed genes, while 170 drugs were predicted for the DEMGs in 
the miRNA-DEMG network. Conclusively, our study predicted drugs that may be 
effective against the metabolic changes induced by miRNA dysregulation in NP. 
This information will help further reveal the pathological mechanism of NP and 
provide more treatment options for NP patients.

Precision medicine emphasizes fine-grained diagnostics, taking individual 
variability into account to enhance treatment effectiveness. Parkinson’s disease 
(PD) heterogeneity among individuals proves the existence of disease subtypes, 
so subgrouping patients is vital for better understanding disease mechanisms and 
designing precise treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify PD 
subtypes using RNA-Seq data in a combined pipeline including unsupervised 
machine learning, bioinformatics, and network analysis. Two hundred and ten post 
mortem brain RNA-Seq samples from PD (n = 115) and normal controls (NCs, n = 95) 
were obtained with systematic data retrieval following PRISMA statements and a 
fully data-driven clustering pipeline was performed to identify PD subtypes. 
Bioinformatics and network analyses were performed to characterize the disease 
mechanisms of the identified PD subtypes and to identify target genes for drug 
repurposing. Two PD clusters were identified and 42 DEGs were found (p adjusted 
≤ 0.01). PD clusters had significantly different gene network structures (p < 
0.0001) and phenotype-specific disease mechanisms, highlighting the differential 
involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulating adult neurogenesis. NEUROD1 
was identified as a key regulator of gene networks and ISX9 and PD98059 were 
identified as NEUROD1-interacting compounds with disease-modifying potential, 
reducing the effects of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This hybrid data 
analysis approach could enable precision medicine applications by providing 
insights for the identification and characterization of pathological subtypes. 
This workflow has proven useful on PD brain RNA-Seq, but its application to 
other neurodegenerative diseases is encouraged.

Background: Loss or partial loss of one X chromosome induces Turner syndrome 
(TS) in females, causing major medical concerns, including otologic disorders. 
However, the underlying genetic pathophysiology of otologic disorders in TS is 
mostly unclear. Methods: Ear-related genes of TS (TSEs) were identified by 
analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in two Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO)-derived expression profiles and ear-genes in the Comparative Toxicogenomic 
Database (CTD). Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG), and Disease Ontology (DO) analyses; Gene Set Enrichment 
Analysis (GSEA); and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were adopted to study 
biological functions. Moreover, hub genes within the TSEs were identified by 
assessing protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene-microRNA, and 
gene-transcription factor (TF) networks. Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) 
analysis was performed to predict molecular drugs for TS. Furthermore, three 
machine-learning analysis outcomes were comprehensively compared to explore 
optimal biomarkers of otologic disorders in TS. Finally, immune cell 
infiltration was analyzed. Results: The TSEs included 30 significantly 
upregulated genes and 14 significantly downregulated genes. Enrichment analyses 
suggested that TSEs play crucial roles in inflammatory responses, phospholipid 
and glycerolipid metabolism, transcriptional processes, and epigenetic 
processes, such as histone acetylation, and their importance for inner ear 
development. Subsequently, we described three hub genes in the PPI network and 
confirmed their involvement in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and immune cell 
regulation and roles in maintaining normal auditory function. We also 
constructed gene-microRNA and gene-TF networks. A novel biomarker (SLC25A6) of 
the pathogenesis of otologic disorders in TS was identified by comprehensive 
comparisons of three machine-learning analyses with the best predictive 
performance. Potential therapeutic agents in TS were predicted using the DGIdb. 
Immune cell infiltration analysis showed that TSEs are related to 
immune-infiltrating cells. Conclusion: Overall, our findings have deepened the 
understanding of the pathophysiology of otologic disorders in TS and made 
contributions to present a promising biomarker and treatment targets for 
in-depth research.

By combining 6 druggable genome resources, we identify 6,083 genes as potential 
druggable genes (PDGs). We characterize their expression, recurrent genomic 
alterations, cancer dependencies, and therapeutic potentials by integrating 
genome, functionome, and druggome profiles across cancers. 81.5% of PDGs are 
reliably expressed in major adult cancers, 46.9% show selective expression 
patterns, and 39.1% exhibit at least one recurrent genomic alteration. We 
annotate a total of 784 PDGs as dependent genes for cancer cell growth. We 
further quantify 16 cancer-related features and estimate a PDG cancer drug 
target score (PCDT score). PDGs with higher PCDT scores are significantly 
enriched for genes encoding kinases and histone modification enzymes. 
Importantly, we find that a considerable portion of high PCDT score PDGs are 
understudied genes, providing unexplored opportunities for drug development in 
oncology. By integrating the druggable genome and the cancer genome, our study 
thus generates a comprehensive blueprint of potential druggable genes across 
cancers.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe and progressive disease that 
affects the heart and lungs and a global health concern that impacts individuals 
and society. Studies have reported that some proteins related to mitochondrial 
metabolic functions could play an essential role in the pathogenesis of PAH, and 
their specific expression and biological function are still unclear. We 
successfully constructed a monocrotaline- (MCT-) induced PAH rat model in the 
present research. Then, the label-free quantification proteomic technique was 
used to determine mitochondrial proteins between the PAH group (n = 6) and the 
normal group (n = 6). Besides, we identified 1346 mitochondrial differentially 
expressed proteins (DEPs) between these two groups. Gene Ontology (GO) and the 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to analyze the mainly 
mitochondrial DEPs' biological functions and the signal pathways. Based on the 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and functional 
enrichment, we screened 19 upregulated mitochondrial genes (Psmd1, Psmc4, 
Psmd13, Psmc2, etc.) and 123 downregulated mitochondrial genes (Uqcrfs1, Uqcrc1, 
Atp5c1, Atp5a1, Uqcrc2, etc.) in rats with PAH. Furthermore, in an independent 
cohort dataset and experiments with rat lung tissue using qPCR, validation 
results consistently showed that 6 upregulated mitochondrial genes (Psmd2, 
Psmc4, Psmc3, Psmc5, Psmd13, and Psmc2) and 3 downregulated mitochondrial genes 
(Lipe, Cat, and Prkce) were significantly differentially expressed in the lung 
tissue of PAH rats. Using the RNAInter database, we predict potential miRNA 
target hub mitochondrial genes at the transcriptome level. We also identified 
bortezomib and carfilzomib as the potential drugs for treatment in PAH. Finally, 
this study provides us with a new perspective on critical biomarkers and 
treatment strategies in PAH.

Drug repurposing identifies new clinical indications for existing drugs. It can 
be used to overcome common problems associated with cancers, such as 
heterogeneity and resistance to established therapies, by rapidly adapting known 
drugs for new treatment. In this study, we utilized a recommendation system 
learning model to prioritize candidate cancer drugs. We designed a drug-drug 
pathway functional similarity by integrating multiple genetic and epigenetic 
alterations such as gene expression, copy number variation (CNV), and DNA 
methylation. When compared with other similarities, such as SMILES chemical 
structures and drug targets based on the protein-protein interaction network, 
our approach provided better interpretable models capturing drug response 
mechanisms. Furthermore, our approach can achieve comparable accuracy when 
evaluated with other learning models based on large public datasets (CCLE and 
GDSC). A case study about the Erlotinib and OSI-906 (Linsitinib) indicated that 
they have a synergistic effect to reduce the growth rate of tumors, which is an 
alternative targeted therapy option for patients. Taken together, our 
computational method characterized drug response from the viewpoint of a 
multi-omics pathway and systematically predicted candidate cancer drugs with 
similar therapeutic effects.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is accountable for 
the protracted COVID-19 pandemic. Its high transmission rate and pathogenicity 
led to health emergencies and economic crisis. Recent studies pertaining to the 
understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited 
the indispensable role of ion channels in viral infection inside the host. 
Moreover, machine learning (ML)-based algorithms are providing a higher accuracy 
for host-SARS-CoV-2 protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In this study, PPIs of 
SARS-CoV-2 proteins with human ion channels (HICs) were trained on the 
PPI-MetaGO algorithm. PPI networks (PPINs) and a signaling pathway map of HICs 
with SARS-CoV-2 proteins were generated. Additionally, various U.S. food and 
drug administration (FDA)-approved drugs interacting with the potential HICs 
were identified. The PPIs were predicted with 82.71% accuracy, 84.09% precision, 
84.09% sensitivity, 0.89 AUC-ROC, 65.17% Matthews correlation coefficient score 
(MCC) and 84.09% F1 score. Several host pathways were found to be altered, 
including calcium signaling and taste transduction pathway. Potential HICs could 
serve as an initial set to the experimentalists for further validation. The 
study also reinforces the drug repurposing approach for the development of host 
directed antiviral drugs that may provide a better therapeutic management 
strategy for infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 complications still present a huge burden on healthcare systems and 
warrant predictive risk models to triage patients and inform early intervention. 
Here, we profile 893 plasma proteins from 50 severe and 50 mild-moderate 
COVID-19 patients, and 50 healthy controls, and show that 375 proteins are 
differentially expressed in the plasma of severe COVID-19 patients. These 
differentially expressed plasma proteins are implicated in the pathogenesis of 
COVID-19 and present targets for candidate drugs to prevent or treat severe 
complications. Based on the plasma proteomics and clinical lab tests, we also 
report a 12-plasma protein signature and a model of seven routine clinical tests 
that validate in an independent cohort as early risk predictors of COVID-19 
severity and patient survival. The risk predictors and candidate drugs described 
in our study can be used and developed for personalized management of SARS-CoV-2 
infected patients.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the host genetic architecture and viral immunity 
contributes to the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics for 
controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Alterations of immune responses in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells play a crucial role in the detrimental progression of 
COVID-19. However, the effects of host genetic factors on immune responses for 
severe COVID-19 remain largely unknown.
METHODS: We constructed a computational framework to characterize the host 
genetics that influence immune cell subpopulations for severe COVID-19 by 
integrating GWAS summary statistics (N = 969,689 samples) with four independent 
scRNA-seq datasets containing healthy controls and patients with mild, moderate, 
and severe symptom (N = 606,534 cells). We collected 10 predefined gene sets 
including inflammatory and cytokine genes to calculate cell state score for 
evaluating the immunological features of individual immune cells.
RESULTS: We found that 34 risk genes were significantly associated with severe 
COVID-19, and the number of highly expressed genes increased with the severity 
of COVID-19. Three cell subtypes that are CD16+monocytes, megakaryocytes, and 
memory CD8+T cells were significantly enriched by COVID-19-related genetic 
association signals. Notably, three causal risk genes of CCR1, CXCR6, and ABO 
were highly expressed in these three cell types, respectively. 
CCR1+CD16+monocytes and ABO+ megakaryocytes with significantly up-regulated 
genes, including S100A12, S100A8, S100A9, and IFITM1, confer higher risk to the 
dysregulated immune response among severe patients. CXCR6+ memory CD8+ T cells 
exhibit a notable polyfunctionality including elevation of proliferation, 
migration, and chemotaxis. Moreover, we observed an increase in cell-cell 
interactions of both CCR1+ CD16+monocytes and CXCR6+ memory CD8+T cells in 
severe patients compared to normal controls among both PBMCs and lung tissues. 
The enhanced interactions of CXCR6+ memory CD8+T cells with epithelial cells 
facilitate the recruitment of this specific population of T cells to airways, 
promoting CD8+T cell-mediated immunity against COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: We uncover a major genetics-modulated immunological shift between 
mild and severe infection, including an elevated expression of genetics-risk 
genes, increase in inflammatory cytokines, and of functional immune cell subsets 
aggravating disease severity, which provides novel insights into parsing the 
host genetic determinants that influence peripheral immune cells in severe 
COVID-19.

Multiple myeloma (MM), second most common hematological malignancy, still 
remains irremediable because of acquisition of drug resistance. Glucocorticoid 
(GC) therapy, which is used as one of the key therapies against MM, is hindered 
by the incidence of GC resistance. The underlying mechanism of this acquired GC 
resistance in MM is not fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study was aimed 
to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), associated micro RNAs 
(miRNAs), and transcription factors (TFs) from the microarray datasets of 
GC-resistant and GC-sensitive MM cell lines, obtained from Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) database. DEGs were identified using GEO2R tool from two datasets 
and common DEGs were obtained by constructing Venn diagram. Then the Gene 
ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were performed using DAVID 
database. Genetic alterations in DEGs were examined using COSMIC database. 
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed using STRING 
database and Cytoscape tool. Network of interaction of DEGs and miRNAs as well 
as TFs were obtained and constructed using mirDIP, TRRUST, and miRNet tools. 
Drug gene interaction was studied to identify potential drug molecules by DGIdb 
tool. Six common DEGs, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, NLRP11, BTK, CD52, and RELN, were found 
to be significantly upregulated in GC-resistant MM and selected for further 
analysis. miRNA analysis detected hsa-mir-34a-5p that could interact with 
maximum target DEGs. Two TFs, Sp1 and Sp3, were found to regulate the expression 
of selected DEGs. The entire study may provide a new understanding about the GC 
resistance in MM.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is considered to be the second most common form of 
dementia after Alzheimer's disease, and no specific drugs have been approved for 
VaD treatment. We aimed to identify shared transcriptomic signatures between the 
frontal cortex and temporal cortex in VaD by bioinformatics analyses. Gene 
ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, protein-protein interaction (PPI) and 
hub gene identification, hub gene-transcription factor interaction, hub 
gene-microRNA interaction, and hub gene-drug interaction analyses were 
performed. We identified 159 overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
between the frontal cortex and temporal cortex that were enriched mainly in 
inflammation and innate immunity, synapse pruning, regeneration, positive 
regulation of angiogenesis, response to nutrient levels, and positive regulation 
of the digestive system process. We identified 10 hub genes in the PPI network 
(GNG13, CD163, C1QA, TLR2, SST, C1QB, ITGB2, CCR5, CRH, and TAC1), four central 
regulatory transcription factors (FOXC1, CREB1, GATA2, and HINFP), and four 
microRNAs (miR-27a-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-335-5p, and miR-129-2-3p). Hub gene-drug 
interaction analysis found four drugs (maraviroc, cenicriviroc, PF-04634817, and 
efalizumab) that could be potential drugs for VaD treatment. Together, our 
results may contribute to understanding the underlying mechanisms in VaD and 
provide potential targets and drugs for therapeutic intervention.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response is an important indicator of patient 
survival in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), but predicting 
chemosensitivity remains a challenge in clinical practice. We developed an 
86-gene-based random forest (RF) classifier capable of predicting neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy response (pathological Complete Response (pCR) or Residual Disease 
(RD)) in TNBC patients. The performance of pCR classification of the proposed 
model was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and 
Precision Recall (PR) curve. The AUROC and AUPRC of the proposed model on the 
test set were 0.891 and 0.829, respectively. At a predefined specificity (>90%), 
the proposed model shows a superior sensitivity compared to the best performing 
reported NAC response prediction model (69.2% vs. 36.9%). Moreover, the 
predicted pCR status by the model well explains the distance recurrence free 
survival (DRFS) of TNBC patients. In addition, the pCR probabilities of the 
proposed model using the expression profiles of the CCLE TNBC cell lines show a 
high Spearman rank correlation with cyclophosphamide sensitivity in the TNBC 
cell lines (SRCC =0.697, p-value =0.031). Associations between the 86 genes and 
DNA repair/cell cycle mechanisms were provided through function enrichment 
analysis. Our study suggests that the random forest-based prediction model 
provides a reliable prediction of the clinical response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and may explain chemosensitivity in TNBC.

T follicular helper (Tfh) cells provide signals to initiate and maintain the 
germinal center (GC) reaction and are crucial for the generation of robust, 
long-lived antibody responses, but how the GC microenvironment affects Tfh cells 
is not well understood. Here we develop an in vivo T cell-intrinsic 
CRISPR-knockout screen to evaluate Tfh and Th1 cells in an acute viral infection 
model to identify regulators of Tfh cells in their physiological setting. Using 
a screen of druggable-targets, alongside genetic, transcriptomic and cellular 
analyses, we identify a function of HIF-1α in suppressing mTORC1-mediated and 
Myc-related pathways, and provide evidence that VHL-mediated degradation of 
HIF-1α is required for Tfh development; an expanded in vivo CRISPR screen 
reveals multiple components of these pathways that regulate Tfh versus Th1 
cells, including signaling molecules, cell-cycle regulators, nutrient 
transporters, metabolic enzymes and autophagy mediators. Collectively, our data 
serve as a resource for studying Tfh versus Th1 decisions, and implicate the 
VHL-HIF-1α axis in fine-tuning Tfh generation.

Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is important for drug discovery. 
However, searching all drug-target spaces poses a major bottleneck. Therefore, 
recently many deep learning models have been proposed to address this problem. 
However, the developers of these deep learning models have neglected 
interpretability in model construction, which is closely related to a model's 
performance. We hypothesized that training a model to predict important regions 
on a protein sequence would increase DTI prediction performance and provide a 
more interpretable model. Consequently, we constructed a deep learning model, 
named Highlights on Target Sequences (HoTS), which predicts binding regions 
(BRs) between a protein sequence and a drug ligand, as well as DTIs between 
them. To train the model, we collected complexes of protein-ligand interactions 
and protein sequences of binding sites and pretrained the model to predict BRs 
for a given protein sequence-ligand pair via object detection employing 
transformers. After pretraining the BR prediction, we trained the model to 
predict DTIs from a compound token designed to assign attention to BRs. We 
confirmed that training the BRs prediction model indeed improved the DTI 
prediction performance. The proposed HoTS model showed good performance in BR 
prediction on independent test datasets even though it does not use 3D structure 
information in its prediction. Furthermore, the HoTS model achieved the best 
performance in DTI prediction on test datasets. Additional analysis confirmed 
the appropriate attention for BRs and the importance of transformers in BR and 
DTI prediction. The source code is available on GitHub ( 
https://github.com/GIST-CSBL/HoTS ).

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major infectious disease, where incomplete 
information about host genetics and immune responses is hindering the 
development of transformative therapies. This study characterized the immune 
cell landscape and blood transcriptomic profile of patients with pulmonary TB 
(PTB) to identify the potential therapeutic biomarkers.
METHODS: The blood transcriptome profile of patients with PTB and controls were 
used for fractionating immune cell populations with the CIBERSORT algorithm and 
then to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with R/Bioconductor 
packages. Later, systems biology investigations (such as semantic similarity, 
gene correlation, and graph theory parameters) were implemented to prioritize 
druggable genes contributing to the immune cell alterations in patients with TB. 
Finally, real time-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm gene expression levels.
RESULTS: Patients with PTB had higher levels of four immune subpopulations like 
CD8+ T cells (P = 1.9 × 10-8), natural killer (NK) cells resting (P = 6.3 × 
10-5), monocytes (P = 6.4 × 10-6), and neutrophils (P = 1.6 × 10-7). The 
functional enrichment of 624 DEGs identified in the blood transcriptome of 
patients with PTB revealed major dysregulation of T cell-related ontologies and 
pathways (q ≤ 0.05). Of the 96 DEGs shared between transcriptome and immune cell 
types, 39 overlapped with TB meta-profiling genetic signatures, and their 
semantic similarity analysis with the remaining 57 genes, yielded 45 new 
candidate TB markers. This study identified 9 CD8+ T cell-associated genes (ITK, 
CD2, CD6, CD247, ZAP70, CD3D, SH2D1A, CD3E, and IL7R) as potential therapeutic 
targets of PTB by combining computational druggability and co-expression (r2 ≥ 
|0.7|) approaches.
CONCLUSION: The changes in immune cell proportion and the downregulation of T 
cell-related genes may provide new insights in developing therapeutic compounds 
against chronic TB.

Genome-wide association studies have identified 3p21.1 as a robust risk locus 
for schizophrenia. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. 
Here a functional regulatory variant (rs2535629) is identified that disrupts 
CTCF binding at 3p21.1. It is confirmed that rs2535629 is also significantly 
associated with schizophrenia in Chinese population and the regulatory effect of 
rs2535629 is validated. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis indicates 
that rs2535629 is associated with the expression of three distal genes (GLT8D1, 
SFMBT1, and NEK4) in the human brain, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing 
confirmed the regulatory effect of rs2535629 on GLT8D1, SFMBT1, and NEK4. 
Interestingly, differential expression analysis of GLT8D1, SFMBT1, and NEK4 
suggested that rs2535629 may confer schizophrenia risk by regulating SFMBT1 
expression. It is further demonstrated that Sfmbt1 regulates neurodevelopment 
and dendritic spine density, two key pathological characteristics of 
schizophrenia. Transcriptome analysis also support the potential role of Sfmbt1 
in schizophrenia pathogenesis. The study identifies rs2535629 as a plausibly 
causal regulatory variant at the 3p21.1 risk locus and demonstrates the 
regulatory mechanism and biological effect of this functional variant, 
indicating that this functional variant confers schizophrenia risk by altering 
CTCF binding and regulating expression of SFMBT1, a distal gene which plays 
important roles in neurodevelopment and synaptic morphogenesis.

Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) stands as one of the main difficulties in the 
treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) as it causes the development of resistant 
clones and leads to heterogeneous drug responses. Here, 12 sets of 
patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and cell lines (PDCs) isolated from multiple 
regions of single tumors from 12 patients, capturing ITH by multiregion sampling 
of individual tumors, are presented. Whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing 
of the 12 sets are performed. The PDOs and PDCs of the 12 sets are also analyzed 
with a clinically relevant 24-compound library to assess their drug responses. 
The results reveal unexpectedly widespread subregional heterogeneity among PDOs 
and PDCs isolated from a single tumor, which is manifested by genetic and 
transcriptional heterogeneity and strong variance in drug responses, while each 
PDO still recapitulates the major histologic, genomic, and transcriptomic 
characteristics of the primary tumor. The data suggest an imminent drawback of 
single biopsy-originated PDO-based clinical diagnosis in evaluating CRC patient 
responses. Instead, the results indicate the importance of targeting common 
somatic driver mutations positioned in the trunk of all tumor subregional clones 
in parallel with a comprehensive understanding of the molecular ITH of each 
tumor.

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. 
The estimated total global TB deaths in 2019 were 1.4 million. The decline in TB 
incidence rate is very slow, while the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) 
is exponentially increasing in low- and middle-income countries, where the 
prevention and treatment of TB disease remains a great burden, and there is 
enough empirical evidence (scientific evidence) to justify a greater research 
emphasis on the syndemic interaction between TB and NCDs. The current study was 
proposed to build a disease-gene network based on overlapping TB with NCDs 
(overlapping means genes involved in TB and other/s NCDs), such as Parkinson's 
disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
lung cancer. We compared the TB-associated genes with genes of its overlapping 
NCDs to determine the gene-disease relationship. Next, we constructed the gene 
interaction network of disease-genes by integrating curated and experimentally 
validated interactions in humans and find the 13 highly clustered modules in the 
network, which contains a total of 86 hub genes that are commonly associated 
with TB and its overlapping NCDs, which are largely involved in the Inflammatory 
response, cellular response to cytokine stimulus, response to cytokine, 
cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, defense response, response to stress and 
immune system process. Moreover, the identified hub genes and their respective 
drugs were exploited to build a bipartite network that assists in deciphering 
the drug-target interaction, highlighting the influential roles of these drugs 
on apparently unrelated targets and pathways. Targeting these hub proteins by 
using drugs combination or drug repurposing approaches will improve the clinical 
conditions in comorbidity, enhance the potency of a few drugs, and give a 
synergistic effect with better outcomes. Thus, understanding the Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and associated NCDs is a high priority to contain 
its short and long-term effects on human health. Our network-based analysis 
opens a new horizon for more personalized treatment, drug-repurposing 
opportunities, investigates new targets, multidrug treatment, and can uncover 
several side effects of unrelated drugs for TB and its overlapping NCDs.

The molecular events and transcriptional plasticity driving brain metastasis in 
clinically relevant breast tumor subtypes has not been determined. Here we 
comprehensively dissect genomic, transcriptomic and clinical data in 
patient-matched longitudinal tumor samples, and unravel distinct transcriptional 
programs enriched in brain metastasis. We report on subtype specific hub genes 
and functional processes, central to disease-affected networks in brain 
metastasis. Importantly, in luminal brain metastases we identify homologous 
recombination deficiency operative in transcriptomic and genomic data with 
recurrent breast mutational signatures A, F and K, associated with mismatch 
repair defects, TP53 mutations and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) 
respectively. Utilizing PARP inhibition in patient-derived brain metastatic 
tumor explants we functionally validate HRD as a key vulnerability. Here, we 
demonstrate a functionally relevant HRD evident at genomic and transcriptomic 
levels pointing to genomic instability in breast cancer brain metastasis which 
is of potential translational significance.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a multifactorial global disease, recognized as one 
of the leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Timely and 
correct diagnoses and effective treatments could significantly reduce incidence 
of complications and improve patient prognoses. In this study, seven 
unconventional differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (MAN2A2, TNFRSF12A, SPP1, 
CSNK1D, PLAUR, PFKFB3, and CXCL16, collectively termed the MTSCPPC signature) 
were identified through integrating DEGs from six MI microarray datasets. The 
pathological and theranostic roles of the MTSCPPC signature in MI were 
subsequently analyzed. We evaluated interactions of the MTSCPPC signature with 
ovatodiolide, a bioactive compound isolated from Anisomeles indica (L.) Kuntze, 
using in silico molecular docking tools and compared it to specific inhibitors 
of the members of the MTSCPPC signature. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 
the public databases revealed high expression levels of the MTSCPPC signature in 
immune cells of adult human hearts during an MI event. The MTSCPPC signature was 
significantly associated with the cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, 
chemokine signaling, immune and inflammatory responses, and metabolic 
dysregulation in MI. Analysis of a micro (mi)RNA regulatory network of the 
MTSCPPC signature suggested post-transcriptional activation and the roles of 
miRNAs in the pathology of MI. Our molecular docking analysis suggested a higher 
potential for ovatodiolide to target MAN2A2, CSNK1D, and TNFRSF12A. 
Collectively, the results derived from the present study further advance our 
understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms of MI and provide a potential 
MI theranostic signature with ovatodiolide as a therapeutic candidate.

Chemosensitivity assays are commonly used for preclinical drug discovery and 
clinical trial optimization. However, data from independent assays are often 
discordant, largely attributed to uncharacterized variation in the experimental 
materials and protocols. We report here the launching of Minimal Information for 
Chemosensitivity Assays (MICHA), accessed via https://micha-protocol.org. 
Distinguished from existing efforts that are often lacking support from data 
integration tools, MICHA can automatically extract publicly available 
information to facilitate the assay annotation including: 1) compounds, 2) 
samples, 3) reagents and 4) data processing methods. For example, MICHA provides 
an integrative web server and database to obtain compound annotation including 
chemical structures, targets and disease indications. In addition, the 
annotation of cell line samples, assay protocols and literature references can 
be greatly eased by retrieving manually curated catalogues. Once the annotation 
is complete, MICHA can export a report that conforms to the FAIR principle 
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) of drug screening studies. To 
consolidate the utility of MICHA, we provide FAIRified protocols from five major 
cancer drug screening studies as well as six recently conducted COVID-19 
studies. With the MICHA web server and database, we envisage a wider adoption of 
a community-driven effort to improve the open access of drug sensitivity assays.

Several studies suggested the role of heme iron, but not non-heme iron in 
colorectal cancer. A network and system biology-based approach was used to 
understand the role of heme and non-heme iron on colorectal cancer etiology. 
Heme and non-heme iron targets were screened in addition to CRC targets. The 
protein-protein interaction map of both iron targets was prepared with CRC 
targets. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis was performed in order to 
understand their role in cancer etiology. The heme iron is predicted to modulate 
several cancer-associated pathways. Our results indicate several targets and 
pathways, including IL-4/IL-13, ACE, and HIF-1 signaling, that may have an 
important role in heme iron-mediated CRC and must be given consideration for 
understanding their role in colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Esophagus cancer (ESCA) is the sixth most frequent cancer in males, 
with 5-year overall survival of 15%-25%. RNA modifications function critically 
in cancer progression, and m6A regulators are associated with ESCA prognosis. 
This study further revealed correlations between m6A and ESCA development.
METHODS: Univariate Cox regression analysis and consensus clustering were 
applied to determine molecular subtypes. Functional pathways and gene ontology 
terms were enriched by gene set enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) analysis on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was conducted for hub 
gene screening. Public drug databases were employed to study the interactions 
between hub genes and small molecules.
RESULTS: Three molecular subtypes related to ESCA prognosis were determined. 
Based on multiple analyses among molecular subtypes, 146 DEGs were screened, and 
a PPT network of 15 hub genes was visualized. Finally, 8 potential 
small-molecule drugs (BMS-754807, gefitinib, neratinib, zuclopenthixol, 
puromycin, sulfasalazine, and imatinib) were identified for treating ESCA.
CONCLUSIONS: This study applied a new approach to analyzing the relation between 
m6A and ESCA prognosis, providing a reference for exploring potential targets 
and drugs for ESCA treatment.

Discovering novel uses for existing drugs, through drug repurposing, can reduce 
the time, costs, and risk of failure associated with new drug development. 
However, prioritizing drug repurposing candidates for downstream studies remains 
challenging. Here, we present a high-throughput approach to identify and 
validate drug repurposing candidates. This approach integrates human gene 
expression, drug perturbation, and clinical data from publicly available 
resources. We apply this approach to find drug repurposing candidates for two 
diseases, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. We screen >21,000 compounds and 
replicate ten approved drugs. We also identify 25 (seven for hyperlipidemia, 
eighteen for hypertension) drugs approved for other indications with therapeutic 
effects on clinically relevant biomarkers. For five of these drugs, the 
therapeutic effects are replicated in the All of Us Research Program database. 
We anticipate our approach will enable researchers to integrate multiple 
publicly available datasets to identify high priority drug repurposing 
opportunities for human diseases.

Owing to a lack of response to the anti-PD1 therapy for most cancer patients, we 
develop a network approach to infer genes, pathways, and potential therapeutic 
combinations that are associated with tumor response to anti-PD1. Here, our 
prediction identifies genes and pathways known to be associated with anti-PD1, 
and is further validated by 6 CRISPR gene sets associated with tumor resistance 
to cytotoxic T cells and targets of the 36 compounds that have been tested in 
clinical trials for combination treatments with anti-PD1. Integration of our top 
prediction and TCGA data identifies hundreds of genes whose expression and 
genetic alterations that could affect response to anti-PD1 in each TCGA cancer 
type, and the comparison of these genes across cancer types reveals that the 
tumor immunoregulation associated with response to anti-PD1 would be 
tissue-specific. In addition, the integration identifies the gene signature to 
calculate the MHC I association immunoscore (MIAS) that shows a good correlation 
with patient response to anti-PD1 for 411 melanoma samples complied from 6 
cohorts. Furthermore, mapping drug target data to the top genes in our 
association prediction identifies inhibitors that could potentially enhance 
tumor response to anti-PD1, such as inhibitors of the encoded proteins of CDK4, 
GSK3B, and PTK2.

Asthma patients may increase their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
the poor prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, 
anti-COVID-19/asthma comorbidity approaches are restricted on condition. 
Existing evidence indicates that luteolin has antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and 
immune regulation capabilities. We aimed to evaluate the possibility of luteolin 
evolving into an ideal drug and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of 
luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. We used system pharmacology and 
bioinformatics analysis to assess the physicochemical properties and biological 
activities of luteolin and further analyze the binding activities, targets, 
biological functions, and mechanisms of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma 
comorbidity. We found that luteolin may exert ideal physicochemical properties 
and bioactivity, and molecular docking analysis confirmed that luteolin 
performed effective binding activities in COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. 
Furthermore, a protein-protein interaction network of 538 common targets between 
drug and disease was constructed and 264 hub targets were obtained. Then, the 
top 6 hub targets of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity were 
identified, namely, TP53, AKT1, ALB, IL-6, TNF, and VEGFA. Furthermore, the 
enrichment analysis suggested that luteolin may exert effects on virus defense, 
regulation of inflammation, cell growth and cell replication, and immune 
responses, reducing oxidative stress and regulating blood circulation through 
the Toll-like receptor; MAPK, TNF, AGE/RAGE, EGFR, ErbB, HIF-1, and PI3K-AKT 
signaling pathways; PD-L1 expression; and PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer. The 
possible "dangerous liaison" between COVID-19 and asthma is still a potential 
threat to world health. This research is the first to explore whether luteolin 
could evolve into a drug candidate for COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. This study 
indicated that luteolin with superior drug likeness and bioactivity has great 
potential to be used for treating COVID-19/asthma comorbidity, but the predicted 
results still need to be rigorously verified by experiments.

We describe a comprehensive and unique database 'Priority index' 
(Pi; http://pi.well.ox.ac.uk) of prioritized genes encoding potential 
therapeutic targets that encompasses all major immune-mediated diseases. We 
provide targets at the gene level, each receiving a 5-star rating supported 
by: genomic evidence arising from disease genome-wide associations and 
functional immunogenomics, annotation evidence using ontologies restricted to 
genes with genomic evidence, and network evidence from protein interactions. 
Target genes often act together in related molecular pathways. The underlying Pi 
approach is unique in identifying a network of highly rated genes that mediate 
pathway crosstalk. In the Pi website, disease-centric pages are specially 
designed to enable the users to browse a complete list of prioritized genes and 
also a manageable list of nodal genes at the pathway crosstalk level; both 
switchable by clicks. Moreover, target genes are cross-referenced and supported 
using additional information, particularly regarding tractability, including 
druggable pockets viewed in 3D within protein structures. Target genes highly 
rated across diseases suggest drug repurposing opportunity, while genes in 
a particular disease reveal disease-specific targeting potential. To facilitate 
the ease of such utility, cross-disease comparisons involving multiple diseases 
are also supported. This facility, together with the faceted search, enhances 
integrative mining of the Pi resource to accelerate early-stage 
therapeutic target identification and validation leveraging human genetics.

To date, only some cancer patients can benefit from chemotherapy and targeted 
therapy. Drug resistance continues to be a major and challenging problem facing 
current cancer research. Rapidly accumulated patient-derived clinical 
transcriptomic data with cancer drug response bring opportunities for exploring 
molecular determinants of drug response, but meanwhile pose challenges for data 
management, integration, and reuse. Here we present the Cancer Treatment 
Response gene signature DataBase (CTR-DB, http://ctrdb.ncpsb.org.cn/), a unique 
database for basic and clinical researchers to access, integrate, and reuse 
clinical transcriptomes with cancer drug response. CTR-DB has collected and 
uniformly reprocessed 83 patient-derived pre-treatment transcriptomic source 
datasets with manually curated cancer drug response information, involving 28 
histological cancer types, 123 drugs, and 5139 patient samples. These data are 
browsable, searchable, and downloadable. Moreover, CTR-DB supports 
single-dataset exploration (including differential gene expression, receiver 
operating characteristic curve, functional enrichment, sensitizing drug search, 
and tumor microenvironment analyses), and multiple-dataset combination and 
comparison, as well as biomarker validation function, which provide insights 
into the drug resistance mechanism, predictive biomarker discovery and 
validation, drug combination, and resistance mechanism heterogeneity.

INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac 
arrhythmia, but the molecular mechanisms underlying AF are not known. We aimed 
to identify the pivotal genes and pathways involved in AF pathogenesis because 
they could become potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of AF.
METHODS: The microarray datasets of GSE31821 and GSE41177 were downloaded from 
the Gene Expression Omnibus database. After combining the two datasets, 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by the Limma package. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) confirmed experimentally to have an interaction with AF were 
screened through the miRTarBase database. Target genes of miRNAs were predicted 
using the miRNet database, and the intersection between DEGs and target genes of 
miRNAs, which were defined as common genes (CGs), were analyzed. Functional and 
pathway-enrichment analyses of DEGs and CGs were performed using the databases 
DAVID and KOBAS. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, miRNA- messenger(m) 
RNA network, and drug-gene network was visualized. Finally, reverse 
transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was 
used to validate the expression of hub genes in the miRNA-mRNA network.
RESULTS: Thirty-three CGs were acquired from the intersection of 65 DEGs from 
the integrated dataset and 9777 target genes of miRNAs. Fifteen "hub" genes were 
selected from the PPI network, and the miRNA-mRNA network, including 82 miRNAs 
and 9 target mRNAs, was constructed. Furthermore, with the validation by 
RT-qPCR, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH 
transcription factor (MYC), inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1), and C-X-C 
Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) were upregulated and superoxide Dismutase 2 
(SOD2) was downregulated in patients with AF compared with healthy controls. We 
also found MIF, MYC, and ID1 were enriched in the transforming growth factor 
(TGF)-β and Hippo signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: We identified several pivotal genes and pathways involved in AF 
pathogenesis. MIF, MYC, and ID1 might participate in AF progression through the 
TGF-β and Hippo signaling pathways. Our study provided new insights into the 
mechanisms of action of AF.

Background: Burn injury is a life-threatening disease that does not have ideal 
biomarkers. Therefore, this study first applied weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed gene (DEG) screening 
methods to identify pivotal genes and diagnostic biomarkers associated with the 
skin burn process. Methods: After obtaining transcriptomic datasets of burn 
patient skin and normal skin from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and performing 
differential analysis and functional enrichment, WGCNA was used to identify hub 
gene modules associated with burn skin processes in the burn patient peripheral 
blood sample dataset and determine the correlation between modules and clinical 
features. Enrichment analysis was performed to identify the functions and 
pathways of key module genes. Differential analysis, WGCNA, protein-protein 
interaction analysis, and enrichment analysis were utilized to screen for hub 
genes. Hub genes were validated in two other GEO datasets, tested by 
immunohistochemistry for hub gene expression in burn patients, and receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis was performed. Finally, we constructed 
the specific drug activity, transcription factors, and microRNA regulatory 
network of the five hub genes. Results: A total of 1,373 DEGs in GSE8056 were 
obtained, and the top 5 upregulated genes were S100A12, CXCL8, CXCL5, MMP3, and 
MMP1, whereas the top 5 downregulated genes were SCGB1D2, SCGB2A2, DCD, TSPAN8, 
and KRT25. DEGs were significantly enriched in the immunity, epidermal 
development, and skin development processes. In WGCNA, the yellow module was 
identified as the most closely associated module with tissue damage during the 
burn process, and the five hub genes (ANXA3, MCEMP1, MMP9, S100A12, and TCN1) 
were identified as the key genes for burn injury status, which consistently 
showed high expression in burn patient blood samples in the GSE37069 and 
GSE13902 datasets. Furthermore, we verified using immunohistochemistry that 
these five novel hub genes were also significantly elevated in burn patient 
skin. In addition, MCEMP1, MMP9, and S100A12 showed perfect diagnostic 
performance in the receiver operating characteristic analysis. Conclusion: In 
conclusion, we analyzed the changes in genetic processes in the skin during 
burns and used them to identify five potential novel diagnostic markers in blood 
samples from burn patients, which are important for burn patient diagnosis. In 
particular, MCEMP1, MMP9, and S100A12 are three key blood biomarkers that can be 
used to identify skin damage in burn patients.

Nature has abundant source of drugs that need to be identified/purified for use 
as essential biologics, either individually or in combination in the modern 
medical field. These drugs are divided into small bio-molecules, plant-made 
biologics, and a recently introduced third category known as phytopharmaceutical 
drugs. The development of phytopharmaceutical medicines is based on the 
ethnopharmacological approach, which relies on the traditional medicine system. 
The concept of 'one-disease one-target drug' is becoming less popular, and the 
use of plant extracts, fractions, and molecules is the new paradigm that holds 
promising scope to formulate appropriate drugs. This led to discovering a new 
concept known as polypharmacology, where natural products from varying sources 
can engage with multiple human physiology targets. This article summarizes 
different approaches for phytopharmaceutical drug development and discusses the 
progress in systems biology and computational tools for identifying drug 
targets. We review the existing drug delivery methods to facilitate the 
efficient delivery of drugs to the targets. In addition, we describe different 
analytical techniques for the authentication and fingerprinting of plant 
materials. Finally, we highlight the role of biopharming in developing 
plant-based biologics.

Dysregulation of immunological and inflammatory processes is frequently observed 
in psychotic disorders. Numerous studies have examined the complex components of 
innate and adaptive immune processes in schizophrenia and related psychoses. 
Elevated inflammation in these conditions is related to neurobiological 
phenotypes and associated with both genetics and environmental exposures. Recent 
studies have utilized multivariate cytokine approaches to identify what appears 
to be a subset of individuals with elevated inflammation. The degree to which 
these findings represent a general process of dysregulated inflammation or 
whether there are more refined subtypes remains unclear. Brain-imaging studies 
have attempted to establish the link between peripheral inflammation and gray 
matter disruption, white matter abnormalities, and neuropsychological 
phenotypes. However, the interplay between peripheral inflammation and 
neuroinflammation, as well as the consequences of this interplay, in the context 
of psychosis remains unclear and requires further investigation. This 
Perspectives article reviews the following elements of immune dysregulation and 
its clinical and therapeutic implications: (1) evidence supporting inflammation 
and immune dysregulation in schizophrenia and related psychoses; (2) recent 
advances in approaches to characterizing subgroups of patients with elevated 
inflammation; (3) relationships between peripheral inflammation and 
brain-imaging indicators of neuroinflammation; (4) convergence of large-scale 
genetic findings and peripheral inflammation findings; and (5) therapeutic 
implications: anti-inflammation interventions leveraging genetic findings for 
drug discovery and repurposing. We offer perspectives and examples of how 
multiomics technologies may be useful for constructing and studying 
immunogenetic signatures. Advancing research in this area will facilitate 
biomarker discovery, disease subtyping, and the development of etiological 
treatments for immune dysregulation in psychosis.

PURPOSE: Despite advances in molecular therapeutics, few anticancer agents 
achieve durable responses. Rational combinations using two or more anticancer 
drugs have the potential to achieve a synergistic effect and overcome drug 
resistance, enhancing antitumor efficacy. A publicly accessible biomedical 
literature search engine dedicated to this domain will facilitate knowledge 
discovery and reduce manual search and review.
METHODS: We developed RetriLite, an information retrieval and extraction 
framework that leverages natural language processing and domain-specific 
knowledgebase to computationally identify highly relevant papers and extract key 
information. The modular architecture enables RetriLite to benefit from 
synergizing information retrieval and natural language processing techniques 
while remaining flexible to customization. We customized the application and 
created an informatics pipeline that strategically identifies papers that 
describe efficacy of using combination therapies in clinical or preclinical 
studies.
RESULTS: In a small pilot study, RetriLite achieved an F1 score of 0.93. A more 
extensive validation experiment was conducted to determine agents that have 
enhanced antitumor efficacy in vitro or in vivo with poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerase inhibitors: 95.9% of the papers determined to be relevant by our 
application were true positive and the application's feature of distinguishing a 
clinical paper from a preclinical paper achieved an accuracy of 97.6%. 
Interobserver assessment was conducted, which resulted in a 100% concordance. 
The data derived from the informatics pipeline have also been made accessible to 
the public via a dedicated online search engine with an intuitive user 
interface.
CONCLUSION: RetriLite is a framework that can be applied to establish 
domain-specific information retrieval and extraction systems. The extensive and 
high-quality metadata tags along with keyword highlighting facilitate 
information seekers to more effectively and efficiently discover knowledge in 
the combination therapy domain.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment is highly 
complex, and selective agents that modulate plaque stability are not yet 
available. We sought to develop a scRNA-seq analysis workflow to investigate 
this environment and uncover potential therapeutic approaches. We designed a 
user-friendly, reproducible workflow that will be applicable to other 
disease-specific scRNA-seq datasets.
METHODS: Here we incorporated automated cell labeling, pseudotemporal ordering, 
ligand-receptor evaluation, and drug-gene interaction analysis into a 
ready-to-deploy workflow. We applied this pipeline to further investigate a 
previously published human coronary single-cell dataset by Wirka et al. Notably, 
we developed an interactive web application to enable further exploration and 
analysis of this and other cardiovascular single-cell datasets.
RESULTS: We revealed distinct derivations of fibroblast-like cells from smooth 
muscle cells (SMCs), and showed the key changes in gene expression along their 
de-differentiation path. We highlighted several key ligand-receptor interactions 
within the atherosclerotic environment through functional expression profiling 
and revealed several avenues for future pharmacological development for 
precision medicine. Further, our interactive web application, PlaqView 
(www.plaqview.com), allows lay scientists to explore this and other datasets and 
compare scRNA-seq tools without prior coding knowledge.
CONCLUSIONS: This publicly available workflow and application will allow for 
more systematic and user-friendly analysis of scRNA datasets in other disease 
and developmental systems. Our analysis pipeline provides many 
hypothesis-generating tools to unravel the etiology of coronary artery disease. 
We also highlight potential mechanisms for several drugs in the atherosclerotic 
cellular environment. Future releases of PlaqView will feature more scRNA-seq 
and scATAC-seq atherosclerosis-related datasets to provide a critical resource 
for the field, and to promote data harmonization and biological interpretation.

The long and challenging drug development process begins with discovery biology 
for the selection of an appropriate target for a specific indication. Target is 
a broad term that can be applied to a range of biological entities such as 
proteins, genes, and ribonucleic acids (RNAs). Although there are numerous 
databases available for mining biological entities, publicly available 
searchable, downloadable databases to aid in target selection for a specific 
disease or indication (e.g., developing contraceptives and infertility 
treatments) are limited. We report the development of the Contraceptive and 
Infertility Target DataBase (https://www.citdbase.org), which provides 
investigators an interface to mine existing transcriptomic and proteomic 
resources to identify high-quality contraceptive/infertility targets. The 
development of similar databases is applicable to the identification of targets 
for other diseases and conditions.

BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed the 
polygenic nature of psychiatric disorders and discovered a few of 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with multiple psychiatric 
disorders. However, the extent and pattern of pleiotropy among distinct 
psychiatric disorders remain not completely clear.
METHODS: We analyzed 14 psychiatric disorders using summary statistics available 
from the largest GWASs by far. We first applied the cross-trait linkage 
disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to estimate genetic correlation between 
disorders. Then, we performed a gene-based pleiotropy analysis by first 
aggregating a set of SNP-level associations into a single gene-level association 
signal using MAGMA. From a methodological perspective, we viewed the 
identification of pleiotropic associations across the entire genome as a 
high-dimensional problem of composite null hypothesis testing and utilized a 
novel method called PLACO for pleiotropy mapping. We ultimately implemented 
functional analysis for identified pleiotropic genes and used Mendelian 
randomization for detecting causal association between these disorders.
RESULTS: We confirmed extensive genetic correlation among psychiatric disorders, 
based on which these disorders can be grouped into three diverse categories. We 
detected a large number of pleiotropic genes including 5884 associations and 
2424 unique genes and found that differentially expressed pleiotropic genes were 
significantly enriched in pancreas, liver, heart, and brain, and that the 
biological process of these genes was remarkably enriched in regulating 
neurodevelopment, neurogenesis, and neuron differentiation, offering substantial 
evidence supporting the validity of identified pleiotropic loci. We further 
demonstrated that among all the identified pleiotropic genes there were 342 
unique ones linked with 6353 drugs with drug-gene interaction which can be 
classified into distinct types including inhibitor, agonist, blocker, 
antagonist, and modulator. We also revealed causal associations among 
psychiatric disorders, indicating that genetic overlap and causality commonly 
drove the observed co-existence of these disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is among the first large-scale effort to characterize 
gene-level pleiotropy among a greatly expanded set of psychiatric disorders and 
provides important insight into shared genetic etiology underlying these 
disorders. The findings would inform psychiatric nosology, identify potential 
neurobiological mechanisms predisposing to specific clinical presentations, and 
pave the way to effective drug targets for clinical treatment.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), oxidative stress (OS) is implicated in the 
neurodegenerative processes that occur from the beginning of the disease. 
Unchecked OS initiates a vicious circle caused by its crosstalk with 
inflammation, leading to demyelination, axonal damage and neuronal loss. The 
failure of MS antioxidant therapies relying on the use of endogenous and natural 
compounds drives the application of novel approaches to assess target relevance 
to the disease prior to preclinical testing of new drug candidates. To identify 
drugs that can act as regulators of intracellular oxidative homeostasis, we 
applied an in silico approach that links genome-wide MS associations and 
molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to proteins of the OS pathway. We found 
10 drugs with both central nervous system and oral bioavailability, targeting 
five out of the 21 top-scoring hits, including arginine methyltransferase 
(CARM1), which was first linked to MS. In particular, the direction of brain 
expression QTLs for CARM1 and protein kinase MAPK1 enabled us to select BIIB021 
and PEITC drugs with the required target modulation. Our study highlights 
OS-related molecules regulated by functional MS variants that could be targeted 
by existing drugs as a supplement to the approved disease-modifying treatments.

Clear cell sarcoma (CCSA) is characterized by a chromosomal translocation 
leading to EWSR1 rearrangement, resulting in aberrant transcription of multiple 
genes, including MET. The EORTC 90101 phase II trial evaluated the MET inhibitor 
crizotinib in CCSA but resulted in only sporadic responses. We performed an 
in-depth histopathological and molecular analysis of archival CCSA samples to 
identify alterations potentially relevant for the treatment outcome. 
Immunohistochemical characterization of MET signaling was performed using a 
tissue microarray constructed from 32 CCSA cases. The DNA from 24 available 
tumor specimens was analyzed by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing and 
whole-exome sequencing for the detection of recurrent copy number alterations 
(CNAs) and mutations. A pathway enrichment analysis was performed to identify 
the pathways relevant for CCSA tumorigenesis. Kaplan-Meier estimates and 
Fisher's exact test were used to correlate the molecular findings with the 
clinical features related to crizotinib treatment, aiming to assess a potential 
association with the outcomes. The histopathological analysis showed the absence 
of a MET ligand and MET activation, with the presence of MET itself in most of 
cases. However, the expression/activation of MET downstream molecules was 
frequently observed, suggesting the role of other receptors in CCSA signal 
transduction. Using sequencing, we detected a number of CNAs at the chromosomal 
arm and region levels. The most common alteration was a gain of 8q24.21, 
observed in 83% of the cases. The loss of chromosomes 9q and 12q24 was 
associated with shorter survival. Based on exome sequencing, 40 
cancer-associated genes were found to be mutated in more than one sample, with 
SRGAP3 and KMT2D as the most common alterations (each in four cases). The 
mutated genes encoded proteins were mainly involved in receptor tyrosine kinase 
signaling, polymerase-II transcription, DNA damage repair, SUMOylation and 
chromatin organization. Disruption in chromatin organization was correlated with 
longer progression-free survival in patients receiving crizotinib. Conclusions: 
The infrequent activation of MET may explain the lack of response to crizotinib 
observed in the majority of cases in the clinical trial. Our work describes the 
molecular heterogeneity in CCSA and provides further insight into the biology of 
this ultra-rare malignancy, which may potentially lead to better therapeutic 
approaches for CCSA.

OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to investigate the potential key molecules 
involved in the progression of skeletal muscle atrophy after SCI.
METHODS: Based on GSE21497 dataset, the DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs were screened 
after differentially expressed analysis. Then the enrichment analyses were 
performed on DEmRNAs. Then the PPI network and ceRNA network were constructed. 
Finally, the DGIdb was utilized to predict drug-gene interactions.
RESULTS: A total of 412 DEmRNAs and 21 DElncRNAs were obtained. The DEmRNAs were 
significantly enriched in MAPK signaling pathway and FoxO signaling pathway. In 
addition, UBE2D1, JUN, and FBXO32 had higher node degrees in PPI network, and 
the top 20 genes with high degree were significantly enriched in FoxO signaling 
pathway and Endometrial cancer. Moreover, FOXO3 was regulated by hsa-miR-1207-5p 
and hsa-miR-1207-5p was regulated by lncRNA RP11-253E3.3 in ceRNA network. 
Finally, 37 drug-gene interactions were obtained based on the 26 genes in ceRNA 
network.
CONCLUSION: UBE2D1, JUN, and FBXO32 are likely to be related to the progression 
of skeletal muscle atrophy after SCI, and activating of MAPK signaling pathway, 
Endometrial cancer and FoxO signaling pathway may induce skeletal muscle 
inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy and atrophy after SCI. Moreover, 
RP11-253E3.3-hsa-miR-1207-5p-FOXO3 axis may be a promising therapeutic target 
for skeletal muscle atrophy after SCI.

BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is becoming more and more general. It may occur at all 
age and affect the language learning ability of children and trigger serious 
social problems.
METHODS: The hearing loss differentially expressed genes (HL-DEGs) were 
recognized through a comparison with healthy subjects. The Gene Ontology (GO) 
analysis was executed by DAVID. The reactome analysis of HL-DEGs was performed 
by Clue-GO. Next, we used STRING, an online website, to identify crucial 
protein-protein interactions among HL-DEGs. Cytoscape software was employed to 
construct a protein-protein interaction network. MCODE, a plug-in of the 
Cytoscape software, was used for module analysis. Finally, we used DGIdb 
database to ascertain the targeted drugs for MCODE genes.
RESULTS: Four hundred four HL-DEGs were identified, among which the most 
up-regulated 10 genes were AL008707.1, SDR42E1P5, BX005040.1, AL671883.2, 
MT1XP1, AC016957.1, U2AF1L5, XIST, DAAM2, and ADAMTS2, and the most 
down-regulated 10 genes were ALOX15, PRSS33, IL5RA, SMPD3, IGHV1-2, IGLV3-9, 
RHOXF1P1, CACNG6, MYOM2, and RSAD2. Through STRING database and MCODE analysis, 
we finally got 16 MCODE genes. These genes can be regarded as hearing loss 
related genes. Through biological analysis, it is found that these genes are 
enriched in pathways related to apoptosis such as tumor necrosis factor. Among 
them, MMP8, LTF, ORM2, FOLR3, and TCN1 have corresponding targeted drugs. 
Foremost, MCODE genes should be investigated for its usefulness as a new 
biomarker for diagnosis and treatment.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our study produced a sixteen-gene signature and 
associated drugs that could be diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss patients.

The low incidence rates of prostatic extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumors 
(EGIST), combined with the lack of published guidelines on its treatment, often 
results in its misdiagnosis and challenges in the treatment of patients, even in 
cases with high-risk factors. The present case study reported a 65-years-old 
Chinese male patient, who presented with intermittent hematuria and lower 
urinary tract symptoms for three months. The colonoscopy results revealed no 
gastrointestinal lesions; however, a core biopsy diagnosed an EGIST, which 
subsequently underwent radical prostatocystotomy, standard pelvic lymph node 
resection, and bricker ileal conduit diversion. The postoperative pathological 
results suggested a high-risk primary prostatic EGIST, according to the 
aggressive behavior of the GIST. The immunohistochemistry results revealed the 
positive expression of CD117, DOG1, CD34, androgen receptor AR, 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a 2% Ki-67 index and a positive surgical 
margin. The whole exome sequencing (WES) results revealed that the patient 
harbored a single nucleotide mutation in 121 genes and copy number variations in 
601 genes, including a defect in c-Kit (in-frame deletion in p.Q556-V560; fold, 
17.5%). By compiling the data obtained from the ConsensusPathDB and the 
drug-gene interaction databases and expert opinions, the patient was prescribed 
with the personalized drugs (400 mg per day imatinib mesylate and 50 mg per day 
bicalutamide, which were stopped when the PSA levels remained stable below 0.01 
ng/ml) for 18 months follow-up and there were no signs of recurrence. In 
conclusion, WES identified multiple genomic alterations and the underlying 
genetic defect in the rare case enabled the evaluation of the prognosis and the 
decision of potential drug candidates. The underlying mechanism of the 
substantial genetic variations in the primary prostatic EGIST, as well as the 
malignant behaviors of the tumor, remain to be investigated.

The alarming pandemic situation of Coronavirus infectious disease COVID-19, 
caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has 
become a critical threat to public health. The unexpected outbreak and 
unrealistic progression of COVID-19 have generated an utmost need to realize 
promising therapeutic strategies to fight the pandemic. Drug repurposing-an 
efficient drug discovery technique from approved drugs is an emerging tactic to 
face the immediate global challenge. It​ offers a time-efficient and 
cost-effective way to find potential therapeutic agents for the disease. 
Artificial Intelligence-empowered deep learning models enable the rapid 
identification of potentially repurposable drug candidates against diseases. 
This study presents a deep learning ensemble model to prioritize clinically 
validated anti-viral drugs for their potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The 
method integrates the similarities of drug chemical structures and virus genome 
sequences to generate feature vectors. The best combination of features is 
retrieved by the convolutional neural network in a deep learning manner. The 
extracted deep features are classified by the extreme gradient boosting 
classifier to infer potential virus-drug associations. The method could achieve 
an AUC of 0.8897 with 0.8571 prediction accuracy and 0.8394 sensitivity under 
the fivefold cross-validation. The experimental results and case studies 
demonstrate the suggested deep learning ensemble system yields competitive 
results compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The top-ranked drugs are 
released for further wet-lab researches.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor progression, recurrence, and 
drug resistance. To identify genetic vulnerabilities of colon cancer, we 
performed targeted CRISPR dropout screens comprising 657 Drugbank targets and 
317 epigenetic regulators on two patient-derived colon CSC-enriched spheroids. 
Next-generation sequencing of pooled genomic DNAs isolated from surviving cells 
yielded therapeutic candidates. We unraveled 44 essential genes for colon 
CSC-enriched spheroids propagation, including key cholesterol biosynthetic genes 
(HMGCR, FDPS, and GGPS1). Cholesterol biosynthesis was induced in colon cancer 
tissues, especially CSC-enriched spheroids. The genetic and pharmacological 
inhibition of HMGCR/FDPS impaired self-renewal capacity and tumorigenic 
potential of the spheroid models in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HMGCR or 
FDPS depletion impaired cancer stemness characteristics by activating TGF-β 
signaling, which in turn downregulated expression of inhibitors of 
differentiation (ID) proteins, key regulators of cancer stemness. Cholesterol 
and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) rescued the growth inhibitory and 
signaling effect of HMGCR/FDPS blockade, implying a direct role of these 
metabolites in modulating stemness. Finally, cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors 
and 5-FU demonstrated antitumor synergy in colon CSC-enriched spheroids, tumor 
organoids, and xenografts. Taken together, our study unravels novel genetic 
vulnerabilities of colon CSC-enriched spheroids and suggests cholesterol 
biosynthesis as a potential target in conjunction with traditional chemotherapy 
for colon cancer treatment.

AIM: Endometriosis is one of the most common reproductive system diseases, but 
the mechanisms of disease progression are still unclear. Due to its high 
recurrence rate, searching for potential therapeutic biomarkers involved in the 
pathogenesis of endometriosis is an urgent issue.
METHODS: Due to the similarities between endometriosis and ovarian cancer, four 
endometriosis datasets and one ovarian cancer dataset were downloaded from Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
identified, followed by gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses. Then, we 
validated gene expression and performed survival analysis with ovarian serous 
cystadenocarcinoma (OV) datasets in TCGA/GTEx database, and searched for 
potential drugs in the Drug-Gene Interaction Database. Finally, we explored the 
miRNAs of key genes to find biomarkers associated with the recurrence of 
endometriosis.
RESULTS: In total, 104 DEGs were identified in the endometriosis datasets, and 
the main enriched GO functions included cell adhesion, extracellular exosome and 
actin binding. Fifty DEGs were identified between endometriosis and ovarian 
cancer datasets including 11 consistently regulated genes, and nine DEGs with 
significant expression in TCGA/GTEx. Only IGHM had both significant expression 
and an association with survival, three module DEGs and two significantly 
expressed DEGs had drug associations, and 10 DEGs had druggability.
CONCLUSIONS: ITGA7, ITGBL1 and SORBS1 may help us understand the invasive nature 
of endometriosis, and IGHM might be related to recurrence; moreover, these genes 
all may be potential therapeutic targets.KEY MESSAGEThis manuscript used a 
bioinformatics approach to find target genes for the treatment of 
endometriosis.This manuscript used a new approach to find target genes by 
drawing on common characteristics between ovarian cancer and endometriosis.We 
screened relevant therapeutic agents for target genes in the drug database, and 
performed histological validation of target genes with both expression and 
survival analysis difference in cancer databases.

High-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of gynecologic origin (NEC-GYN) is a highly 
aggressive cancer that often affects young women. The clinical management of 
NEC-GYN is typically extrapolated from its counterpart, small cell carcinoma of 
the lung (SCLC), but, unfortunately, available therapies have limited benefit. 
In our NEC-GYN cohort, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) were 1 and 12 months, respectively, indicating the highly lethal 
nature of this cancer. Our comprehensive genomic analyses unveiled that NEC-GYN 
harbors a higher mutational burden with distinct mutational landscapes from 
SCLC. We identified 14 cancer driver genes, including the most frequently 
altered KMT2C (100%), KNL1 (100%), NCOR2 (100%), and CCDC6 (93%) genes. 
Transcriptomic analysis identified several novel gene fusions; astonishingly, 
the MALAT1 lincRNA gene was found in ˜ 20% of all fusion events in NEC-GYN. 
Furthermore, NEC-GYN exhibited a highly immunosuppressive state, intact RB1 
expression, and was uniquely enriched with the YAP1high molecular subtype. Our 
study identifies several potential therapeutic targets and suggests an urgent 
need to re-evaluate the treatment options for NEC-GYN.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a major public health issue 
as its progression increases risks of multisystem morbidity and mortality. 
Recent evidence indicates a more complex relationship between hypertension and 
NAFLD than previously thought. In this study, a comprehensive literature search 
was used to gather information supporting the comorbidity phenomenon of 
hypertension and NAFLD. Then, systems biology approach was applied to identify 
the potential genes and mechanisms simultaneously associated with hypertension 
and NAFLD. With the help of protein-protein interaction network-based algorithm, 
we found that the distance between hypertension and NAFLD was much less than 
random ones. Sixty-four shared genes of hypertension and NAFLD modules were 
identified as core genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) 
enrichment analysis indicated that some inflammatory, metabolic and endocrine 
signals were related to the potential biological functions of core genes. More 
importantly, drugs used to treat cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, inflammatory diseases and depression could be potential 
therapeutics against hypertension-NAFLD co-occurrence. After analyzing public 
OMICs data, ALDH1A1 was identified as a potential therapeutic target, without 
being affected by reverse causality. These findings give a clue for the 
potential mechanisms of comorbidity of hypertension and NAFLD and highlight the 
multiple target-therapeutic strategy of NAFLD for future clinical research.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem, autoimmune 
inflammatory disease with genomic and non-genomic contributions to risk. We 
hypothesize that epigenetic factors are a significant contributor to SLE risk 
and may be informative for identifying pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic 
targets. To test this hypothesis while controlling for genetic background, we 
performed an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in genomic DNA from 
whole blood in three pairs of female monozygotic (MZ) twins of European 
ancestry, discordant for SLE. Results were replicated on the same array in four 
cell types from a set of four Danish female MZ twin pairs discordant for SLE. 
Genes implicated by the epigenetic analyses were then evaluated in 10 
independent SLE gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 
There were 59 differentially methylated loci between unaffected and affected MZ 
twins in whole blood, including 11 novel loci. All but two of these loci were 
hypomethylated in the SLE twins relative to the unaffected twins. The genes 
harboring these hypomethylated loci exhibited increased expression in multiple 
independent datasets of SLE patients. This pattern was largely consistent 
regardless of disease activity, cell type, or renal tissue type. The genes 
proximal to CpGs exhibiting differential methylation (DM) in the SLE-discordant 
MZ twins and exhibiting differential expression (DE) in independent SLE GEO 
cohorts (DM-DE genes) clustered into two pathways: the nucleic acid-sensing 
pathway and the type I interferon pathway. The DM-DE genes were also 
informatically queried for potential gene-drug interactions, yielding a list of 
41 drugs including a known SLE therapy. The DM-DE genes delineate two important 
biologic pathways that are not only reflective of the heterogeneity of SLE but 
may also correlate with distinct IFN responses that depend on the source, type, 
and location of nucleic acid molecules and the activated receptors in individual 
patients. Cell- and tissue-specific analyses will be critical to the 
understanding of genetic factors dysregulating the nucleic acid-sensing and IFN 
pathways and whether these factors could be appropriate targets for therapeutic 
intervention.

Spinal ependymomas are the most common spinal cord tumors in adults, but their 
intratumoral cellular heterogeneity has been less studied, and how spinal 
microglia are involved in tumor progression is still unknown. Here, our 
single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses of three spinal ependymoma subtypes dissect 
the microenvironmental landscape of spinal ependymomas and reveal 
tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subsets with distinct functional phenotypes. 
CCL2+ TAMs are related to the immune response and exhibit a high capacity for 
apoptosis, while CD44+ TAMs are associated with tumor angiogenesis. By combining 
these results with those of single-cell ATAC-sequencing data analysis, we reveal 
that TEAD1 and EGR3 play roles in regulating the functional diversity of TAMs. 
We further identify diverse characteristics of both malignant cells and TAMs 
that might underlie the different malignant degrees of each subtype. Finally, 
assessment of cell-cell interactions reveal that stromal cells act as 
extracellular factors that mediate TAM diversity. Overall, our results reveal 
dual functions of TAMs in tumor progression, providing valuable insights for 
TAM-targeting immunotherapy.

Rosacea is significantly associated with dementia, particularly Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, the common underlying molecular mechanism connecting 
these two diseases remains limited. This study aimed to reveal the common 
molecular regulatory networks and identify the potential therapeutic drugs for 
rosacea and AD. There were 747 overlapped DEGs (ol-DEGs) that were detected in 
AD and rosacea, enriched in inflammation-, metabolism-, and apoptosis-related 
pathways. Using the TF regulatory network analysis, 37 common TFs and target 
genes were identified as hub genes. They were used to predict the therapeutic 
drugs for rosacea and AD using the DGIdb/CMap database. Among the 113 predicted 
drugs, melatonin (MLT) was co-associated with both RORA and IFN-γ in AD and 
rosacea. Subsequently, network pharmacology analysis identified 19 
pharmacological targets of MLT and demonstrated that MLT could help in treating 
AD/rosacea partly by modulating inflammatory and vascular signaling pathways. 
Finally, we verified the therapeutic role and mechanism of MLT on rosacea in 
vivo and in vitro. We found that MLT treatment significantly improved 
rosacea-like skin lesion by reducing keratinocyte-mediated inflammatory cytokine 
secretion and repressing the migration of HUVEC cells. In conclusion, this study 
contributes to common pathologies shared by rosacea and AD and identified MLT as 
an effective treatment strategy for rosacea and AD via regulating inflammation 
and angiogenesis.

Cancer precision medicine implies identification of tumor-specific 
vulnerabilities associated with defined oncogenic pathways. Desmoid tumors are 
soft-tissue neoplasms strictly driven by Wnt signaling network hyperactivation. 
Despite this clearly defined genetic etiology and the strict and unique 
implication of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, no specific molecular targets for 
these tumors have been identified. To address this caveat, we developed fast, 
efficient, and penetrant genetic Xenopus tropicalis desmoid tumor models to 
identify and characterize drug targets. We used multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 genome 
editing in these models to simultaneously target a tumor suppressor gene (apc) 
and candidate dependency genes. Our methodology CRISPR/Cas9 selection-mediated 
identification of dependencies (CRISPR-SID) uses calculated deviations between 
experimentally observed gene editing outcomes and deep-learning-predicted 
double-strand break repair patterns to identify genes under negative selection 
during tumorigenesis. This revealed EZH2 and SUZ12, both encoding polycomb 
repressive complex 2 components, and the transcription factor CREB3L1 as genetic 
dependencies for desmoid tumors. In vivo EZH2 inhibition by Tazemetostat induced 
partial regression of established autochthonous tumors. In vitro models of 
patient desmoid tumor cells revealed a direct effect of Tazemetostat on Wnt 
pathway activity. CRISPR-SID represents a potent approach for in vivo mapping of 
tumor vulnerabilities and drug target identification.

Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is considered to be an independent 
factor affecting lipid metabolism. This study explored the relationship between 
immune genes and lipid metabolism in OSA. Methods: Immune-related Differentially 
Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified by analyzing microarray data sets from 
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Subsequently, we conducted 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and calculated their Gene 
Ontology (GO) semantic similarity. The GO, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathways, Disease Ontology (DO), gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA), and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were employed for functional 
enrichment analyses and to determine the most significant functional terms. 
Combined with the results of boruta and random forest, we selected predictors to 
build a prognostic model, along with seeking out the potential TFs and target 
drugs for the predictive genes. Results: Immune-related DEGs included 64 genes 
upregulated and 98 genes downregulated. The enrichment analysis might closely 
associate with cell adhesion and T cell-mediated immunity pathways and there 
were many DEGs involved in lipid and atherosclerosis signaling pathways. The 
highest-ranking hub gene in PPI network have been reported lowly expressed in 
OSA. In line with the enrichment analysis, DO analysis reveal that respiratory 
diseases may be associated with OSA besides immune system disorders. Consistent 
with the result of the KEGG pathway, the analysis of GSVA revealed that the 
pro-inflammation pathways are associated with OSA. Monocytes and CD8 T cells 
were the predominant immune cells in adipose tissue. We built a prognostic model 
with the top six genes, and the prognostic genes were involved in the 
polarization of macrophage and differentiation of T lymphocyte subsets. In vivo 
experimental verification revealed that EPGN, LGR5, NCK1 and VIP were 
significantly down-regulated while PGRMC2 was significantly up-regulated in 
mouse model of OSA. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated strong associations 
between immune genes and the development of dyslipidemia in OSA. This work 
promoted the molecular mechanisms and potential targets for the regulation of 
lipid metabolism in OSA.

BACKGROUND: Melanoma is one of the most malignant and aggressive skin tumors, 
and its incidence is increasing worldwide. However, few studies have 
investigated the process of tumorigenesis from normal skin to melanoma.
METHODS: Several bioinformatics analyses, including GEO databases, Oncomine 
database, TCGA database, STRING, MCODE and cytoHubba plug-ins, GEPIA, TIMER and 
TRRUST and DGIdb, were performed to disclose the hub genes and immunology 
implicated in primary melanoma tumorigenesis. Finally, immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to validate the results of 
bioinformatics analysis in vitro.
RESULTS: A total of 295 overlapping DEGs (ODEGs) (157 upregulated and 138 
downregulated) and 9 hub genes were identified between primary melanoma and 
normal skin tissues. Functional analysis of these 9 hub genes indicated that the 
genes were primarily enriched in cell chemotaxis, the chemokine-mediated 
signaling pathway, the extracellular region, the extracellular space, chemokine 
activity and CXCR3 chemokine receptor binding. KEGG pathway enrichment showed 
that these genes were primarily involved in the chemokine signaling pathway, 
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the toll-like receptor signaling 
pathway, the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and the TNF signaling pathway. 
Upregulated CCL5, CCL4, CXCL9 and CXCL10 demonstrated good overall survival 
(OS), and most of them have a higher expression in stage 0 and 1 of melanoma. 
Moreover, immune infiltration analysis showed that the above hub genes showed a 
strong positive correlation between their expression and infiltration of the six 
immune cell subsets. Transcription factor regulation network suggested that RELA 
and NFKB1 are the transcription factors of CCL4, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL2, while 
IRF7, IRF3 and IRF1 are the transcription factors of CCL5 and CXCL10. Drug-gene 
interaction analysis identified 46 drug-gene interactions. In vitro data 
demonstrated that the level of CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10 is higher in 
melanoma than that in normal skin tissues, either at tissue or cell lines level.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we identified 4 key chemokine members related to 
tumorigenesis and progression in primary melanoma, and these results may help to 
elucidate melanoma tumorigenesis and facilitate its treatment.

We observed a case of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) carried by a 28-month-old 
girl, displaying metastatic disease and a rapid decline of clinical conditions. 
By array-CGH analysis of the tumor tissue and of the metastatic bone marrow 
aspirate cells, we found a high-grade amplification of six regions besides MYCN 
on bands 2p25.3-p24.3. The genes involved in these amplifications were MYT1L, 
TSSC1, CMPK2, RSAD2, RNF144A, GREB1, NTSR2, LPIN1, NBAS, and the two intergenic 
non-protein coding RNAs LOC730811 and LOC339788. We investigated if these DNA 
co-amplifications may have an effect on enhancing tumor aggressiveness. We 
evaluated the association between the high expression of the amplified genes and 
NB patient's outcome using the integration of gene expression data of 786 NB 
samples profiled with different public platforms from patients with at least 
five-year follow-up. NB patients with high expression of the TSSC1 gene were 
associated with a reduced survival rate. Immunofluorescence staining on primary 
tumor tissues confirmed that the TSSC1 protein expression was high in the 
relapsed or dead stage 4 cases, but it was generally low in NB patients in 
complete remission. TSSC1 appears as a putative new oncogene in NB.

Metastatic cancer is associated with poor patient prognosis but its 
spatiotemporal behavior remains unpredictable at early stage. Here we develop 
MetaNet, a computational framework that integrates clinical and sequencing data 
from 32,176 primary and metastatic cancer cases, to assess metastatic risks of 
primary tumors. MetaNet achieves high accuracy in distinguishing the metastasis 
from the primary in breast and prostate cancers. From the prediction, we 
identify Metastasis-Featuring Primary (MFP) tumors, a subset of primary tumors 
with genomic features enriched in metastasis and demonstrate their higher 
metastatic risk and shorter disease-free survival. In addition, we identify 
genomic alterations associated with organ-specific metastases and employ them to 
stratify patients into various risk groups with propensities toward different 
metastatic organs. This organotropic stratification method achieves better 
prognostic value than the standard histological grading system in prostate 
cancer, especially in the identification of Bone-MFP and Liver-MFP subtypes, 
with potential in informing organ-specific examinations in follow-ups.

Myocardial infarction knowledge base (MIKB; http://www.sysbio.org.cn/mikb/; 
latest update: December 31, 2020) is an open-access and manually curated 
database dedicated to integrating knowledge about MI to improve the efficiency 
of translational MI research. MIKB is an updated and expanded version of our 
previous MI Risk Knowledge Base (MIRKB), which integrated MI-related risk 
factors and risk models for providing help in risk assessment or diagnostic 
prediction of MI. The updated MIRKB includes 9701 records with 2054 single 
factors, 209 combined factors, 243 risk models, 37 MI subtypes and 3406 
interactions between single factors and MIs collected from 4817 research 
articles. The expanded functional module, i.e. MIGD, is a database including not 
only MI associated genetic variants, but also the other multi-omics factors and 
the annotations for their functional alterations. The goal of MIGD is to provide 
a multi-omics level understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MI. MIGD 
includes 1782 omics factors, 28 MI subtypes and 2347 omics factor-MI 
interactions as well as 1253 genes and 6 chromosomal alterations collected from 
2647 research articles. The functions of MI associated genes and their 
interaction with drugs were analyzed. MIKB will be continuously updated and 
optimized to provide precision and comprehensive knowledge for the study of 
heterogeneous and personalized MI.

BACKGROUND: To identify candidate key genes and pathways related to resting mast 
cells in meningioma and the underlying molecular mechanisms of meningioma.
METHODS: Gene expression profiles of the used microarray datasets were obtained 
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GO and KEGG pathway enrichments 
of DEGs were analyzed using the ClusterProfiler package in R. The 
protein-protein interaction network (PPI), and TF-miRNA- mRNA co-expression 
networks were constructed. Further, the difference in immune infiltration was 
investigated using the CIBERSORT algorithm.
RESULTS: A total of 1499 DEGs were identified between tumor and normal controls. 
The analysis of the immune cell infiltration landscape showed that the 
probability of distribution of memory B cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and 
resting mast cells in tumor samples were significantly higher than those in the 
controls. Moreover, through WGCNA analysis, the module related to resting mast 
cells contained 158 DEGs, and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were 
dominant in the TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, 
and IL-17 signaling pathway. Survival analysis of hub genes related to resting 
mast cells showed that the risk model was constructed based on 9 key genes. The 
TF-miRNA- mRNA co-regulation network, including MYC-miR-145-5p, 
TNFAIP3-miR-29c-3p, and TNFAIP3-hsa-miR-335-3p, were obtained. Further, 36 nodes 
and 197 interactions in the PPI network were identified.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed candidate key genes, miRNAs, and 
pathways related to resting mast cells involved in meningioma development, 
providing potential therapeutic targets for meningioma treatment.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious viral 
respiratory illness. This illness is spurred on by a coronavirus known as 
SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first detected in Asia in late 
February 2003. The genome of this virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV-2. 
Therefore, the study of SARS-CoV disease and the identification of effective 
drugs to treat this disease can be new clues for the treatment of SARS-Cov-2. 
This study aimed to discover novel potential drugs for SARS-CoV disease in order 
to treating SARS-Cov-2 disease based on a novel systems biology approach. To 
this end, gene co-expression network analysis was applied. First, the gene 
co-expression network was reconstructed for 1441 genes, and then two gene 
modules were discovered as significant modules. Next, a list of miRNAs and 
transcription factors that target gene co-expression modules' genes were 
gathered from the valid databases, and two sub-networks formed of transcription 
factors and miRNAs were established. Afterward, the list of the drugs targeting 
obtained sub-networks' genes was retrieved from the DGIDb database, and two 
drug-gene and drug-TF interaction networks were reconstructed. Finally, after 
conducting different network analyses, we proposed five drugs, including 
FLUOROURACIL, CISPLATIN, SIROLIMUS, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, and METHYLDOPA, as 
candidate drugs for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus treatment. Moreover, ten miRNAs 
including miR-193b, miR-192, miR-215, miR-34a, miR-16, miR-16, miR-92a, miR-30a, 
miR-7, and miR-26b were found to be significant miRNAs in treating SARS-CoV-2 
coronavirus.

Each patient's cancer consists of multiple cell subpopulations that are 
inherently heterogeneous and may develop differing phenotypes such as drug 
sensitivity or resistance. A personalized treatment regimen should therefore 
target multiple oncoproteins in the cancer cell populations that are driving the 
treatment resistance or disease progression in a given patient to provide 
maximal therapeutic effect, while avoiding severe co-inhibition of non-malignant 
cells that would lead to toxic side effects. To address the intra- and 
inter-tumoral heterogeneity when designing combinatorial treatment regimens for 
cancer patients, we have implemented a machine learning-based platform to guide 
identification of safe and effective combinatorial treatments that selectively 
inhibit cancer-related dysfunctions or resistance mechanisms in individual 
patients. In this case study, we show how the platform enables prediction of 
cancer-selective drug combinations for patients with high-grade serous ovarian 
cancer using single-cell imaging cytometry drug response assay, combined with 
genome-wide transcriptomic and genetic profiles. The platform makes use of 
drug-target interaction networks to prioritize those combinations that warrant 
further preclinical testing in scarce patient-derived primary cells. During the 
case study in ovarian cancer patients, we investigated (i) the relative 
performance of various ensemble learning algorithms for drug response 
prediction, (ii) the use of matched single-cell RNA-sequencing data to 
deconvolute cell population-specific transcriptome profiles from bulk RNA-seq 
data, (iii) and whether multi-patient or patient-specific predictive models lead 
to better predictive accuracy. The general platform and the comparison results 
are expected to become useful for future studies that use similar predictive 
approaches also in other cancer types.

MOTIVATION: Assessment of genetic mutations is an essential element in the 
modern era of personalized cancer treatment. Our strategy is focused on 
'multiple network analysis' in which we try to improve cancer diagnostics by 
using biological networks. Genetic alterations in some important hubs or in 
driver genes such as BRAF and TP53 play a critical role in regulating many 
important molecular processes. Most of the studies are focused on the analysis 
of the effects of single mutations, while tumors often carry mutations of 
multiple driver genes. The aim of this work is to define an innovative 
bioinformatics pipeline focused on the design and analysis of networks (such as 
biomedical and molecular networks), in order to: (1) improve the disease 
diagnosis; (2) identify the patients that could better respond to a given drug 
treatment; and (3) predict what are the primary and secondary effects of gene 
mutations involved in human diseases.
RESULTS: By using our pipeline based on a multiple network approach, it has been 
possible to demonstrate and validate what are the joint effects and changes of 
the molecular profile that occur in patients with metastatic colorectal 
carcinoma (mCRC) carrying mutations in multiple genes. In this way, we can 
identify the most suitable drugs for the therapy for the individual patient. 
This information is useful to improve precision medicine in cancer patients. As 
an application of our pipeline, the clinically significant case studies of a 
cohort of mCRC patients with the BRAF V600E-TP53 I195N missense combined 
mutation were considered.
AVAILABILITY: The procedures used in this paper are part of the Cytoscape Core, 
available at (www.cytoscape.org). Data used here on mCRC patients have been 
published in [55].

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is 
undeniably the most severe global health emergency since the 1918 Influenza 
outbreak. Depending on its evolutionary trajectory, the virus is expected to 
establish itself as an endemic infectious respiratory disease exhibiting 
seasonal flare-ups. Therefore, despite the unprecedented rally to reach a 
vaccine that can offer widespread immunization, it is equally important to reach 
effective prevention and treatment regimens for coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). Contributing to this effort, we have curated and analyzed 
multi-source and multi-omics publicly available data from patients, cell lines 
and databases in order to fuel a multiplex computational drug repurposing 
approach. We devised a network-based integration of multi-omic data to 
prioritize the most important genes related to COVID-19 and subsequently re-rank 
the identified candidate drugs. Our approach resulted in a highly informed 
integrated drug shortlist by combining structural diversity filtering along with 
experts' curation and drug-target mapping on the depicted molecular pathways. In 
addition to the recently proposed drugs that are already generating promising 
results such as dexamethasone and remdesivir, our list includes inhibitors of 
Src tyrosine kinase (bosutinib, dasatinib, cytarabine and saracatinib), which 
appear to be involved in multiple COVID-19 pathophysiological mechanisms. In 
addition, we highlight specific immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs 
like dactolisib and methotrexate and inhibitors of histone deacetylase like 
hydroquinone and vorinostat with potential beneficial effects in their 
mechanisms of action. Overall, this multiplex drug repurposing approach, 
developed and utilized herein specifically for SARS-CoV-2, can offer a rapid 
mapping and drug prioritization against any pathogen-related disease.

Precision oncology is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary medical specialty. 
Comprehensive cancer panels are becoming increasingly available at pathology 
departments worldwide, creating the urgent need for scalable cancer variant 
annotation and molecularly informed treatment recommendations. A wealth of 
mainly academia-driven knowledge bases calls for software tools supporting the 
multi-step diagnostic process. We derive a comprehensive list of knowledge bases 
relevant for variant interpretation by a review of existing literature followed 
by a survey among medical experts from university hospitals in Germany. In 
addition, we review cancer variant interpretation tools, which integrate 
multiple knowledge bases. We categorize the knowledge bases along the diagnostic 
process in precision oncology and analyze programmatic access options as well as 
the integration of knowledge bases into software tools. The most commonly used 
knowledge bases provide good programmatic access options and have been 
integrated into a range of software tools. For the wider set of knowledge bases, 
access options vary across different parts of the diagnostic process. 
Programmatic access is limited for information regarding clinical 
classifications of variants and for therapy recommendations. The main issue for 
databases used for biological classification of pathogenic variants and pathway 
context information is the lack of standardized interfaces. There is no single 
cancer variant interpretation tool that integrates all identified knowledge 
bases. Specialized tools are available and need to be further developed for 
different steps in the diagnostic process.

The growing prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) constitutes an urgent health 
crisis. Ample evidence indicates that risk for OUD is heritable. As a surrogate 
(or proxy) for OUD, we explored the genetic basis of using prescription opioids 
'not as prescribed'. We hypothesized that misuse of opiates might be a heritable 
risk factor for OUD. To test this hypothesis, we performed a genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) of problematic opioid use (POU) in 23andMe research 
participants of European ancestry (N = 132,113; 21% cases). We identified two 
genome-wide significant loci (rs3791033, an intronic variant of KDM4A; rs640561, 
an intergenic variant near LRRIQ3). POU showed positive genetic correlations 
with the two largest available GWAS of OUD and opioid dependence (rg = 
0.64, 0.80, respectively). We also identified numerous additional genetic 
correlations with POU, including alcohol dependence (rg = 0.74), smoking 
initiation (rg = 0.63), pain relief medication intake (rg = 0.49), major 
depressive disorder (rg = 0.44), chronic pain (rg = 0.42), insomnia (rg = 0.39), 
and loneliness (rg = 0.28). Although POU was positively genetically correlated 
with risk-taking (rg = 0.38), conditioning POU on risk-taking did not 
substantially alter the magnitude or direction of these genetic correlations, 
suggesting that POU does not simply reflect a genetic tendency towards risky 
behavior. Lastly, we performed phenome- and lab-wide association analyses, which 
uncovered additional phenotypes that were associated with POU, including 
respiratory failure, insomnia, ischemic heart disease, and metabolic and 
blood-related biomarkers. We conclude that opioid misuse can be measured in 
population-based cohorts and provides a cost-effective complementary strategy 
for understanding the genetic basis of OUD.

The study of parental lifespan has emerged as an innovative tool to advance 
aging biology and our understanding of the genetic architecture of human 
longevity and aging-associated diseases. Here, we leveraged summary statistics 
of a genome-wide association study including over one million parental lifespans 
to identify genetically regulated genes from the Genotype-Tissue Expression 
project. Through a combination of multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association 
analyses and genetic colocalization, we identified novel genes that may be 
associated with parental lifespan. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses also 
identified circulating proteins and metabolites causally associated with 
parental lifespan and chronic diseases offering new drug repositioning 
opportunities such as those targeting apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins. 
Liver expression of HP, the gene encoding haptoglobin, and plasma haptoglobin 
levels were causally linked with parental lifespan. Phenome-wide MR analyses 
were used to map genetically regulated genes, proteins and metabolites with 
other human traits as well as the disease-related phenome in the FinnGen cohorts 
(n = 135,638). Altogether, this study identified new candidate genes, 
circulating proteins and metabolites that may influence human aging as well as 
potential therapeutic targets for chronic diseases that warrant further 
investigation.

Early-onset epileptic encephalopathies are severe disorders often associated 
with specific genetic mutations. In this context, the CDKL5 deficiency disorder 
(CDD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by early-onset seizures, 
intellectual delay, and motor dysfunction. Although crucial for proper brain 
development, the precise targets of CDKL5 and its relation to patients' symptoms 
are still unknown. Here, induced pluripotent stem cells derived from individuals 
deficient in CDKL5 protein were used to generate neural cells. Proteomic and 
phosphoproteomic approaches revealed disruption of several pathways, including 
microtubule-based processes and cytoskeleton organization. While CDD-derived 
neural progenitor cells have proliferation defects, neurons showed morphological 
alterations and compromised glutamatergic synaptogenesis. Moreover, the 
electrical activity of CDD cortical neurons revealed hyperexcitability during 
development, leading to an overly synchronized network. Many parameters of this 
hyperactive network were rescued by lead compounds selected from a human 
high-throughput drug screening platform. Our results enlighten cellular, 
molecular, and neural network mechanisms of genetic epilepsy that could 
ultimately promote novel therapeutic opportunities for patients.

Influenza viruses cause respiratory tract infections and substantial health 
concerns. Infection may result in mild to severe respiratory disease associated 
with morbidity and some mortality. Several anti-influenza drugs are available, 
but these agents target viral components and are susceptible to drug resistance. 
There is a need for new antiviral drug strategies that include repurposing of 
clinically approved drugs. Drugs that target cellular machinery necessary for 
influenza virus replication can provide a means for inhibiting influenza virus 
replication. We used RNA interference screening to identify key host cell genes 
required for influenza replication, and then FDA-approved drugs that could be 
repurposed for targeting host genes. We examined the effects of Clopidogrel and 
Triamterene to inhibit A/WSN/33 (EC50 5.84 uM and 31.48 uM, respectively), 
A/CA/04/09 (EC50 6.432 uM and 3.32 uM, respectively), and B/Yamagata/16/1988 
(EC50 0.28 uM and 0.11 uM, respectively) replication. Clopidogrel and 
Triamterene provide a druggable approach to influenza treatment across multiple 
strains and subtypes.

Current epidemics, such as AIDS or flu, and the emergence of new threatening 
pathogens, such as the one causing the current coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic, represent major global health challenges. While vaccination 
is an important part of the arsenal to counter the spread of viral diseases, it 
presents limitations and needs to be complemented by efficient therapeutic 
solutions. Intricate knowledge of host-pathogen interactions is a powerful tool 
to identify host-dependent vulnerabilities that can be exploited to dampen viral 
replication. Such host-directed antiviral therapies are promising and are less 
prone to the development of drug-resistant viral strains. Here, we first 
describe proteomics-based strategies that allow the rapid characterization of 
host-pathogen interactions. We then discuss how such data can be exploited to 
help prioritize compounds with potential host-directed antiviral activity that 
can be tested in preclinical models.

Prostate cancer (PCa) in dogs is a highly malignant disease akin to its human 
counterpart. In contrast to the situation in humans, multi-gene approaches 
facilitating risk stratification of canine PCa are barely established. The aims 
of this study were the characterization of the transcriptional landscape of 
canine PCa and the identification of diagnostic, prognostic and/or therapeutic 
biomarkers through a multi-step screening approach. RNA-Sequencing of ten 
malignant tissues and fine-needle aspirations (FNA), and 14 nonmalignant tissues 
and FNAs was performed to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 
deregulated pathways. The 4098 observed DEGs were involved in 49 pathways. These 
49 pathways could be grouped into five superpathways summarizing the hallmarks 
of canine PCa: (i) inflammatory response and cytokines; (ii) regulation of the 
immune system and cell death; (iii) cell surface and PI3K signaling; (iv) cell 
cycle; and (v) phagosome and autophagy. Among the highly deregulated, moderately 
to strongly expressed DEGs that were members of one or more superpathways, 169 
DEGs were listed in relevant databases and/or the literature and included 
members of the PCa pathway, oncogenes, prostate-specific genes, and druggable 
genes. These genes are novel and promising candidate diagnostic, prognostic 
and/or therapeutic canine PCa biomarkers.

The etiology of osteosarcoma (OS) is complex and not fully understood till now. 
This study aimed to identify the miRNAs, circRNAs, and genes (mRNAs) that are 
differentially expressed in OS cell lines to investigate the mechanism of 
circRNA-associated competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) in OS. Microarray datasets 
reporting mRNA (GSE70414), miRNA (GSE70367), and circRNA changes (GSE96964) in 
human OS cell lines were downloaded, differentially expressed (DE) RNAs were 
identified, and DEmRNAs were used for the annotation of Gene Ontology (GO) 
biological processes (BP), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathways. The mechanisms of DEcircRNA-mediated ceRNAs were identified in a 
step-by-step process. A total of 326 DEmRNAs, 45 DEmiRNAs, and 110 DEcircRNAs 
were identified from 3 datasets. The DEmRNAs were associated with GO BP terms, 
including cholesterol biosynthetic process, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix 
organization and KEGG pathways, including p53 signaling pathway and biosynthesis 
of antibiotics. The final ceRNA network consisted of 8 DEcircRNAs, including 5 
pappalysin (PAPPA) 1-derived DEcircRNAs (hsa_circ_0005456, hsa_circ_0088209, 
hsa_circ_0002052, hsa_circ_0088214 and has_circ_0008792, all downregulated), 3 
DEmiRNAs (hsa-miR-760, hsa-miR-4665-5p and hsa-miR-4539, all upregulated), and 
downregulated genes (including MMP13 and HMOX1). The ceRNA regulation network of 
OS was built, which played important roles in the pathogenesis of OS and might 
be of great importance in therapy.

Epigenetic mechanisms which play an essential role in normal developmental 
processes, such as self-renewal and fate specification of neural stem cells 
(NSC) are also responsible for some of the changes in the glioblastoma (GBM) 
genome. Here we develop a strategy to compare the epigenetic and transcriptional 
make-up of primary GBM cells (GIC) with patient-matched expanded potential stem 
cell (EPSC)-derived NSC (iNSC). Using a comparative analysis of the 
transcriptome of syngeneic GIC/iNSC pairs, we identify a glycosaminoglycan 
(GAG)-mediated mechanism of recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in GBM. 
Integrated analysis of the transcriptome and DNA methylome of GBM cells 
identifies druggable target genes and patient-specific prediction of drug 
response in primary GIC cultures, which is validated in 3D and in vivo models. 
Taken together, we provide a proof of principle that this experimental pipeline 
has the potential to identify patient-specific disease mechanisms and druggable 
targets in GBM.

Over the course of human history, billions of people worldwide have been 
infected by various viruses. Despite rapid progress in the development of 
biomedical techniques, it is still a significant challenge to find promising new 
antiviral targets and drugs. In the past, antiviral drugs mainly targeted viral 
proteins when they were used as part of treatment strategies. Since the virus 
mutation rate is much faster than that of the host, such drugs feature drug 
resistance and narrow-spectrum antiviral problems. Therefore, the targeting of 
host molecules has gradually become an important area of research for the 
development of antiviral drugs. In recent years, rapid advances in 
high-throughput sequencing techniques have enabled numerous genetic studies 
(such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), clustered regularly 
interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening, etc.) for human 
diseases, providing valuable genetic and evolutionary resources. Furthermore, it 
has been revealed that successful drug targets exhibit similar genetic and 
evolutionary features, which are of great value in identifying promising drug 
targets and discovering new drugs. Considering these developments, in this 
article the authors propose a host-targeted antiviral drug discovery strategy 
based on knowledge of genetics and evolution. We first comprehensively 
summarized the genetic, subcellular location, and evolutionary features of the 
human genes that have been successfully used as antiviral targets. Next, the 
summarized features were used to screen novel druggable antiviral targets and to 
find potential antiviral drugs, in an attempt to promote the discovery of new 
antiviral drugs.

Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is characterized by dismal prognosis, 
partially due to its low sensitivity to standard chemotherapy regimen. It is 
also well-known for presenting unique molecular features in comparison to other 
epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes. Here, we aim to identify potential subgroups 
of patients in order to (1) determine their molecular features and (2) 
characterize their mutational signature. Furthermore, we sought to perform the 
investigation based on a potentially clinically relevant setting. To that end, 
we assessed the mutational profile and genomic instability of 55 patients 
extracted from the Gynecologic Cancer Database (DGCD) by using a panel comprised 
of 409 cancer-associated genes and a microsatellite assay, respectively; both 
are currently used in our routine environment. In accordance with previous 
findings, ARID1A and PIK3CA were the most prevalent mutations, present in 49.1% 
and 41.8%, respectively. From those, the co-occurrence of ARID1A and PIK3CA 
mutations was observed in 36.1% of subjects, indicating that this association 
might be a common feature of OCCC. The microsatellite instability frequency was 
low across samples. An unbiased assessment of signatures identified the presence 
of three subgroups, where "PIK3CA" and "Double hit" (with ARID1A and PIK3CA 
double mutation) subgroups exhibited unique signatures, whilst "ARID1A" and 
"Undetermined" (no mutations on ARID1A nor PIK3CA) subgroups showed similar 
profiles. Those differences were further indicated by COSMIC signatures. Taken 
together, the current findings suggest that OCCC presents distinct mutational 
landscapes within its group, which may indicate different therapeutic approaches 
according to its subgroup. Although encouraging, it is noteworthy that the 
current results are limited by sample size, and further investigation on a 
larger group would be crucial to better elucidate them.

Asthma affects more than 300 million people globally and is both under diagnosed 
and under treated. The most recent and largest genome-wide association study 
investigating moderate to severe asthma to date was carried out in 2019 and 
identified 25 independent signals. However, as new and in-depth downstream 
databases become available, the translational analysis of these signals into 
target genes and pathways is timely. In this study, unique (U-BIOPRED) and 
publicly available datasets (HaploReg, Open Target Genetics and GTEx) were 
investigated for the 25 GWAS signals to identify 37 candidate causal genes. 
Additional traits associated with these signals were identified through PheWAS 
using the UK Biobank resource, with asthma and eosinophilic traits amongst the 
strongest associated. Gene expression omnibus dataset examination identified 13 
candidate genes with altered expression profiles in the airways and blood of 
asthmatic subjects, including MUC5AC and STAT6. Gene expression analysis through 
publicly available datasets highlighted lung tissue cell specific expression, 
with both MUC5AC and SLC22A4 genes showing enriched expression in ciliated 
cells. Gene enrichment pathway and interaction analysis highlighted the 
dominance of the HLA-DQA1/A2/B1/B2 gene cluster across many immunological 
diseases including asthma, type I diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Interaction and prediction analyses found IL33 and IL18R1 to be key 
co-localization partners for other genes, predicted that CD274 forms 
co-expression relationships with 13 other genes, including the HLA-DQA1/A2/B1/B2 
gene cluster and that MUC5AC and IL37 are co-expressed. Drug interaction 
analysis revealed that 11 of the candidate genes have an interaction with 
available therapeutics. This study provides significant insight into these GWAS 
signals in the context of cell expression, function, and disease relationship 
with the view of informing future research and drug development efforts for 
moderate-severe asthma.

Hearing loss (HL) is one of the most common disabilities in the world. In 
industrialized countries, HL occurs in 1-2/1,000 newborns, and approximately 60% 
of HL is caused by genetic factors. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been 
widely used to identify many candidate genes and variants in patients with HL, 
but the data are scattered in multitudinous studies. It is a challenge for 
scientists, clinicians, and biologists to easily obtain and analyze HL genes and 
variant data from these studies. Thus, we developed a one-stop database of 
HL-related genes and variants, Gene4HL (http://www.genemed.tech/gene4hl/), 
making it easy to catalog, search, browse and analyze the genetic data. Gene4HL 
integrates the detailed genetic and clinical data of 326 HL-related genes from 
1,608 published studies, along with 62 popular genetic data sources to provide 
comprehensive knowledge of candidate genes and variants associated with HL. 
Additionally, Gene4HL supports the users to analyze their own genetic 
engineering network data, performs comprehensive annotation, and prioritizes 
candidate genes and variations using custom parameters. Thus, Gene4HL can help 
users explain the function of HL genes and the clinical significance of variants 
by correlating the genotypes and phenotypes in humans.

BACKGROUND: Sciatic nerve injury (SNI), which frequently occurs under the 
traumatic hip and hip fracture dislocation, induces serious complications such 
as motor and sensory loss, muscle atrophy, or even disabling. The present work 
aimed to determine the regulating factors and gene network related to the SNI 
pathology.
METHODS: Sciatic nerve injury dataset GSE18803 with 24 samples was divided into 
adult group and neonate group. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA) was carried out to identify modules associated with SNI in the two 
groups. Moreover, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined from 
every group, separately. Subsequently, co-expression network and protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network were overlapped to identify hub genes, while 
functional enrichment and Reactome analysis were used for a comprehensive 
analysis of potential pathways. GSE30165 was used as the test set for 
investigating the hub gene involvement within SNI. Gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) was performed separately using difference between samples and gene 
expression level as phenotype label to further prove SNI-related signaling 
pathways. In addition, immune infiltration analysis was accomplished by 
CIBERSORT. Finally, Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb) was employed for 
predicting the possible therapeutic agents.
RESULTS: 14 SNI status modules and 97 DEGs were identified in adult group, while 
15 modules and 21 DEGs in neonate group. A total of 12 hub genes was overlapping 
from co-expression and PPI network. After the results from both test and 
training sets were overlapped, we verified that the ten real hub genes showed 
remarkably up-regulation within SNI. According to functional enrichment of hub 
genes, the above genes participated in the immune effector process, inflammatory 
responses, the antigen processing and presentation, and the phagocytosis. GSEA 
also supported that gene sets with the highest significance were mostly related 
to the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Analysis of hub genes possible 
related signaling pathways using gene expression level as phenotype label 
revealed an enrichment involved in Lysosome, Chemokine signaling pathway, and 
Neurotrophin signaling pathway. Immune infiltration analysis showed that 
Macrophages M2 and Regulatory T cells may participate in the development of SNI. 
At last, 25 drugs were screened from DGIdb to improve SNI treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression network is determined in the present work based 
on the related regulating factors within SNI, which sheds more light on SNI 
pathology and offers the possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets in 
subsequent research.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known as a critical neurodegenerative disorder. It 
worsens as symptoms concerning dementia grow severe over the years. Due to the 
globalization of Alzheimer's disease, its prevention and treatment are vital. 
This study proposes a method to extract substantial gene complexes and then 
introduces potential drugs in Alzheimer's disease. To this end, a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was utilized to extract five 
meaningful gene complexes functionally interconnected. An enrichment analysis to 
introduce the most important biological processes and pathways was accomplished 
on the obtained genes. The next step is extracting the drugs related to AD and 
introducing some new drugs which may be helpful for this disease. Finally, a 
complete network including all the genes associated with each gene complex group 
and genes' target drug was illustrated. For validating the proposed potential 
drugs, Connectivity Map (CMAP) analysis was accomplished to determine target 
genes that are up- or downregulated by proposed drugs. Medical studies and 
publications were analyzed thoroughly to introduce AD-related drugs. This 
analysis proves the accuracy of the proposed method in this study. Then, new 
drugs were introduced that can be experimentally examined as future work. 
Raloxifene and gentian violet are two new drugs, which have not been introduced 
as AD-related drugs in previous scientific and medical studies, recommended by 
the method of this study. Besides the primary goal, five bipartite networks 
representing the genes of each group and their target miRNAs were constructed to 
introduce target miRNAs.

BACKGROUND: Although increasing evidence has suggested an interaction between 
heart failure (HF) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the common mechanisms of 
the two diseases remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to obtain the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and potential biomarkers or therapeutic 
targets in HF and T2DM.
METHODS: The communal DEGs of HF and T2DM were identified by analyzing the two 
microarray datasets (GSE84796 and GSE95849), and functional annotation was 
performed for the communal DEGs to uncover the potential molecular mechanisms of 
HF and T2DM. Subsequently, STRING database and Cytoscape software were used to 
construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and screen the hub 
genes. Finally, co-expression and drug-gene interaction prediction analysis and 
mRNA-miRNA regulatory network analysis were performed for hub genes.
RESULTS: A total of 233 up-regulated genes and 3 down-regulated genes were found 
between HF and T2DM. The functional enrichment of DEGs and genes in each four 
modules were mainly involved in immunity. In addition, five hub genes were 
identified from PPI network, including SYK, SELL, RAC2, TLR8 and ITGAX.
CONCLUSION: The communal DEGs and hub genes identified in this research 
contribute to discover the underlying biological mechanisms and presents 
potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in HF and T2DM.

Stem and progenitor cells are the main mediators of tissue renewal and repair, 
both under homeostatic conditions and in response to physiological stress and 
injury. Hematopoietic system is responsible for the regeneration of blood and 
immune cells and is maintained by bone marrow-resident hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells (HSPCs). Hematopoietic system is particularly susceptible to 
injury in response to genotoxic stress, resulting in the risk of bone marrow 
failure and secondary malignancies in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. 
Here we analyze the in vivo transcriptional response of HSPCs to genotoxic 
stress in a mouse whole-body irradiation model and, together with p53 ChIP-Seq 
and studies in p53-knockout (p53KO) mice, characterize the p53-dependent and 
p53-independent branches of this transcriptional response. Our work demonstrates 
the p53-independent induction of inflammatory transcriptional signatures in 
HSPCs in response to genotoxic stress and identifies multiple novel p53-target 
genes induced in HSPCs in response to whole-body irradiation. In particular, we 
establish the direct p53-mediated induction of P2X7 expression on HSCs and HSPCs 
in response to genotoxic stress. We further demonstrate the role of P2X7 in 
hematopoietic response to acute genotoxic stress, with P2X7 deficiency 
significantly extending mouse survival in irradiation-induced hematopoietic 
failure. We also demonstrate the role of P2X7 in the context of long-term HSC 
regenerative fitness following sublethal irradiation. Overall our studies 
provide important insights into the mechanisms of HSC response to genotoxic 
stress and further suggest P2X7 as a target for pharmacological modulation of 
HSC fitness and hematopoietic response to genotoxic injury.

BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Immunotherapy, especially anti-PD-1, is becoming a 
pillar of ccRCC treatment. However, precise biomarkers and robust models are 
needed to select the proper patients for immunotherapy.
METHODS: A total of 831 ccRCC transcriptomic profiles were obtained from 6 
datasets. Unsupervised clustering was performed to identify the immune subtypes 
among ccRCC samples based on immune cell enrichment scores. Weighted correlation 
network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify hub genes distinguishing subtypes 
and related to prognosis. A machine learning model was established by a random 
forest (RF) algorithm and used on an open and free online website to predict the 
immune subtype.
RESULTS: In the identified immune subtypes, subtype2 was enriched in immune cell 
enrichment scores and immunotherapy biomarkers. WGCNA analysis identified four 
hub genes related to immune subtypes, CTLA4, FOXP3, IFNG, and CD19. The RF model 
was constructed by mRNA expression of these four hub genes, and the value of 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.78. Subtype2 
patients in the independent validation cohort had a better drug response and 
prognosis for immunotherapy treatment. Moreover, an open and free website was 
developed by the RF model (https://immunotype.shinyapps.io/ISPRF/).
CONCLUSIONS: The current study constructs a model and provides a free online 
website that could identify suitable ccRCC patients for immunotherapy, and it is 
an important step forward to personalized treatment.

Many studies have shown that the lysosomal cathepsins, especially cathepsins B/L 
(CTSB/L) are required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Lysosomal proteases, 
cathepsins are indispensable for normal health and are involved in several brain 
disorders occurring at different development age periods. On the other hand, it 
has been well known that COVID-19 infection is largely associated with several 
neurological disorders. Taken together these findings and given the high levels 
of expression of CTSB/L in the brain, we here proposed a reasonable hypothesis 
about the involvement of CTSB/L in the neurological manifestations linked to 
COVID-19. Pharmacological inhibitions of the CTSB/L could be a potential 
therapeutic target to block the virus entry as well as to mitigate the brain 
disorders. To this end, we utilized the network-based drug repurposing analyses 
to identify the possible drugs that can target CTSB/L. This study identifies the 
molecules like cyclosporine, phenytoin, and paclitaxel as potential drugs with 
binding ability to the CTSB/L. Further, we have performed molecular docking and 
all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the stability of 
CTSL-drug complexes. The results showed strong and stable binding of drugs with 
CTSL.

OBJECTIVE: Incidence of both Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) are rapidly increasing worldwide. One of the leading causes of 
HCC is hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is a resource of blood-borne viral 
infection. HCV increases the risk for HCC probably by promoting fibrosis and 
cirrhosis. Association among T2DM and HCV related HCC remains significant, 
indicating that such association is clinically reliable and robust. Lawson was 
the first who uncovered HCC in person suffered from T2DM. Until now, genetic 
association between HCV related HCC and T2DM is poorly known. Current work was 
designed to figure out the molecular mechanisms of both diseases by identifying 
the hub genes and therapeutic drugs using integrated bioinformatics analysis.
METHODS: Four microarray datasets were downloaded from GEO database and analyzed 
using R in order to obtain different expressed genes (DEGs). Protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) networks was constructed using STRING tool and visualized by 
Cytoscape. Moreover, hub genes were identified on the basis of their degree of 
connectivity. Finally, Networkanalyst and DGIdb were used for the identification 
of transcription factors (TFs) and selection of candidate drugs, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 53 DEGs were identified, of which 41 were upregulated genes 
and 12 were downregulated genes. PPI network obtained from STRING were subjected 
to Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba, and top 10 genes (AURKA, JUN, AR, MELK, NCOA2, 
CENPF, NCAPG, PCK1, RAD51AP1, and GTSE1) were chosen as the target hub genes 
based on the highest degree of connectivity. Furthermore, 47 drugs of AURKA, 
JUN, AR, MELK, and NCOA2 were found having therapeutic potential to treat 
HCV-HCC in patients with T2DM.
CONCLUSION: This study updates the information and yield a new perspective in 
context of understanding the pathogenesis and development of HCV related HCC in 
affected persons with T2DM. In vivo and in vitro investigation of hub genes and 
pathway interaction is essential to delineate the specific roles of the novel 
hub genes, which may help to reveal the genetic association between HCV-HCC and 
T2DM. In future, hub genes along with their candidate drugs might be capable of 
improving the personalized detection and therapies for both diseases.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To integrate genome-wide association study data with 
tissue-specific gene expression information to identify coexpression networks, 
biological pathways, and drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer disease.
METHODS: We integrated genome-wide association summary statistics for Alzheimer 
disease with tissue-specific gene coexpression networks from brain tissue 
samples in the Genotype-Tissue Expression study. We identified gene coexpression 
networks enriched with genetic signals for Alzheimer disease and characterized 
the associated networks using biological pathway analysis. The 
disease-implicated modules were subsequently used as a molecular substrate for a 
computational drug repositioning analysis, in which we (1) imputed genetically 
regulated gene expression within Alzheimer disease implicated modules; (2) 
integrated the imputed gene expression levels with drug-gene signatures from the 
connectivity map to identify compounds that normalize dysregulated gene 
expression underlying Alzheimer disease; and (3) prioritized drug compounds and 
mechanisms of action based on the extent to which they normalize dysregulated 
expression signatures.
RESULTS: Genetic factors for Alzheimer disease are enriched in brain gene 
coexpression networks involved in the immune response. Computational drug 
repositioning analyses of expression changes within the disease-associated 
networks retrieved known Alzheimer disease drugs (e.g., memantine) as well as 
biologically meaningful drug categories (e.g., glutamate receptor antagonists).
DISCUSSION: Our results improve the biological interpretation of genetic data 
for Alzheimer disease and provide a list of potential antidementia drug 
repositioning candidates for which the efficacy should be investigated in 
functional validation studies.

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are an emerging drug modality that may 
offer new opportunities to circumvent some of the limitations associated with 
traditional small-molecule therapeutics. By analogy with the concept of the 
'druggable genome', the question arises as to which potential drug targets might 
PROTAC-mediated protein degradation be most applicable. Here, we present a 
systematic approach to the assessment of the PROTAC tractability 
(PROTACtability) of protein targets using a series of criteria based on data and 
information from a diverse range of relevant publicly available resources. Our 
approach could support decision-making on whether or not a particular target may 
be amenable to modulation using a PROTAC. Using our approach, we identified 
1,067 proteins of the human proteome that have not yet been described in the 
literature as PROTAC targets that offer potential opportunities for future 
PROTAC-based efforts.

Metal binding sites, antigen epitopes and drug binding sites are the hotspots in 
viral proteins that control how viruses interact with their hosts. virusMED 
(virus Metal binding sites, Epitopes and Drug binding sites) is a rich internet 
application based on a database of atomic interactions around hotspots in 7041 
experimentally determined viral protein structures. 25306 hotspots from 805 
virus strains from 75 virus families were characterized, including influenza, 
HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Just as Google Maps organizes and annotates points 
of interest, virusMED presents the positions of individual hotspots on each 
viral protein and creates an atlas upon which newly characterized functional 
sites can be placed as they are being discovered. virusMED contains an extensive 
set of annotation tags about the virus species and strains, viral hosts, viral 
proteins, metal ions, specific antibodies and FDA-approved drugs, which permits 
rapid screening of hotspots on viral proteins tailored to a particular research 
problem. The virusMED portal (https://virusmed.biocloud.top) can serve as a 
window to a valuable resource for many areas of virus research and play a 
critical role in the rational design of new preventative and therapeutic agents 
targeting viral infections.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and disabling 
mental disorders worldwide. Among the symptoms of MDD, sleep disturbance such as 
insomnia is prominent, and the first reason patients may seek professional help. 
However, the underlying pathophysiology of this comorbidity is still elusive. 
Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unveil the 
genetic background of several psychiatric disorders, including MDD and insomnia. 
Identifying the shared genomic risk loci between comorbid psychiatric disorders 
could be a valuable strategy to understanding their comorbidity. This study 
seeks to identify the shared genes and biological pathways between MDD and 
insomnia based on their shared genetic variants. First, we performed a 
meta-analysis based on the GWAS summary statistics of MDD and insomnia obtained 
from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and UK Biobank, respectively. Next, we 
associated shared genetic variants to genes using two gene mapping strategies: 
(a) positional mapping based on genomic proximity and (b) expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping based on gene expression linkage across 
multiple tissues. As a result, a total of 719 shared genes were identified. Over 
half (51%) of them are protein-coding genes. Functional enrichment analysis 
shows that the most enriched biological pathways are related to epigenetic 
modification, sensory perception, and immunologic signatures. We also identified 
druggable targets using a network approach. Together, these results may provide 
insights into understanding the genetic predisposition and underlying biological 
pathways of comorbid MDD and insomnia symptoms.

BACKGROUND: As one of the deadliest diseases in the world, cancer is driven by a 
few somatic mutations that disrupt the normal growth of cells, and leads to 
abnormal proliferation and tumor development. The vast majority of somatic 
mutations did not affect the occurrence and development of cancer; thus, 
identifying the mutations responsible for tumor occurrence and development is 
one of the main targets of current cancer treatments.
RESULTS: To effectively identify driver genes, we adopted a semi-local 
centrality measure and gene mutation effect function to assess the effect of 
gene mutations on changes in gene expression patterns. Firstly, we calculated 
the mutation score for each gene. Secondly, we identified differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) in the cohort by comparing the expression profiles of 
tumor samples and normal samples, and then constructed a local network for each 
mutation gene using DEGs and mutant genes according to the protein-protein 
interaction network. Finally, we calculated the score of each mutant gene 
according to the objective function. The top-ranking mutant genes were selected 
as driver genes. We name the proposed method as mutations effect and network 
centrality.
CONCLUSIONS: Four types of cancer data in The Cancer Genome Atlas were tested. 
The experimental data proved that our method was superior to the existing 
network-centric method, as it was able to quickly and easily identify driver 
genes and rare driver factors.

BACKGROUND: Although chronic periodontitis has previously been reported to be 
linked with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the pathogenesis between the two is 
unclear. The purpose of this study is to analyze and screen the relevant and 
promising molecular markers between chronic periodontitis and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: In this paper, we analyzed three AD expression datasets and extracted 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), then intersected them with chronic 
periodontitis genes obtained from text mining, and finally obtained integrated 
DEGs. We followed that by enriching the matching the matching cell signal 
cascade through DAVID analysis. Moreover, the MCODE of Cytoscape software was 
employed to uncover the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the 
matching hub gene. Finally, we verified our data using a different independent 
AD cohort.
RESULTS: The chronic periodontitis gene set acquired from text abstracting was 
intersected with the previously obtained three AD groups, and 12 common genes 
were obtained. Functional enrichment assessment uncovered 12 cross-genes, which 
were mainly linked to cell morphogenesis involved in neuron differentiation, 
leading edge membrane, and receptor ligand activity. After PPI network creation, 
the ten hub genes linked to AD were retrieved, consisting of SPP1, THY1, CD44, 
ITGB1, HSPB3, CREB1, SST, UCHL1, CCL5 and BMP7. Finally, the function terms in 
the new independent dataset were used to verify the previous dataset, and we 
found 22 GO terms and one pathway, "ECM-receptor interaction pathways", in the 
overlapping functional terms.
CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of the above-mentioned candidate key genes, as 
well as the enriched signaling cascades, provides promising molecular markers 
for chronic periodontitis-related AD, which may help the diagnosis and treatment 
of AD patients in the future.

Identifying genomic alterations of cancer proteins has guided the development of 
targeted therapies, but proteomic analyses are required to validate and reveal 
new treatment opportunities. Herein, we develop a new algorithm, OPPTI, to 
discover overexpressed kinase proteins across 10 cancer types using global mass 
spectrometry proteomics data of 1,071 cases. OPPTI outperforms existing methods 
by leveraging multiple co-expressed markers to identify targets overexpressed in 
a subset of tumors. OPPTI-identified overexpression of ERBB2 and EGFR proteins 
correlates with genomic amplifications, while CDK4/6, PDK1, and MET protein 
overexpression frequently occur without corresponding DNA- and RNA-level 
alterations. Analyzing CRISPR screen data, we confirm expression-driven 
dependencies of multiple currently-druggable and new target kinases whose 
expressions are validated by immunochemistry. Identified kinases are further 
associated with up-regulated phosphorylation levels of corresponding signaling 
pathways. Collectively, our results reveal protein-level aberrations-sometimes 
not observed by genomics-represent cancer vulnerabilities that may be targeted 
in precision oncology.

Osteoarthritis (OA) and major depression (MD) are two debilitating disorders 
that frequently co-occur and affect millions of the elderly each year. Despite 
the greater symptom severity, poorer clinical outcomes, and increased mortality 
of the comorbid conditions, we have a limited understanding of their etiologic 
relationships. In this study, we conducted the first cross-disorder 
investigations of OA and MD, using genome-wide association data representing 
over 247K cases and 475K controls. Along with significant positive genome-wide 
genetic correlations (r g = 0.299 ± 0.026, p = 9.10 × 10-31), Mendelian 
randomization (MR) analysis identified a bidirectional causal effect between OA 
and MD (βOA → MD = 0.09, SE = 0.02, z-score p-value < 1.02 × 10-5; βMD → OA = 
0.19, SE = 0.026, p < 2.67 × 10-13), indicating genetic variants affecting OA 
risk are, in part, shared with those influencing MD risk. Cross-disorder 
meta-analysis of OA and MD identified 56 genomic risk loci (P meta ≤ 5 × 10-8), 
which show heightened expression of the associated genes in the brain and 
pituitary. Gene-set enrichment analysis highlighted "mechanosensory behavior" 
genes (GO:0007638; P gene_set = 2.45 × 10-8) as potential biological mechanisms 
that simultaneously increase susceptibility to these mental and physical health 
conditions. Taken together, these findings show that OA and MD share common 
genetic risk mechanisms, one of which centers on the neural response to the 
sensation of mechanical stimulus. Further investigation is warranted to 
elaborate the etiologic mechanisms of the pleiotropic risk genes, as well as to 
develop early intervention and integrative clinical care of these serious 
conditions that disproportionally affect the aging population.

Drug discovery based on artificial intelligence has been in the spotlight 
recently as it significantly reduces the time and cost required for developing 
novel drugs. With the advancement of deep learning (DL) technology and the 
growth of drug-related data, numerous deep-learning-based methodologies are 
emerging at all steps of drug development processes. In particular, 
pharmaceutical chemists have faced significant issues with regard to selecting 
and designing potential drugs for a target of interest to enter preclinical 
testing. The two major challenges are prediction of interactions between drugs 
and druggable targets and generation of novel molecular structures suitable for 
a target of interest. Therefore, we reviewed recent deep-learning applications 
in drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction and de novo drug design. In 
addition, we introduce a comprehensive summary of a variety of drug and protein 
representations, DL models, and commonly used benchmark datasets or tools for 
model training and testing. Finally, we present the remaining challenges for the 
promising future of DL-based DTI prediction and de novo drug design.

PURPOSE: Systems biology approaches can identify critical targets in complex 
cancer signaling networks to inform new therapy combinations that may overcome 
conventional treatment resistance.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed integrated analysis of 1,046 childhood B-ALL 
cases and developed a data-driven network controllability-based approach to 
identify synergistic key regulator targets in Philadelphia chromosome-like 
B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like B-ALL), a common high-risk leukemia 
subtype associated with hyperactive signal transduction and chemoresistance.
RESULTS: We identified 14 dysregulated network nodes in Ph-like ALL involved in 
aberrant JAK/STAT, Ras/MAPK, and apoptosis pathways and other critical 
processes. Genetic cotargeting of the synergistic key regulator pair STAT5B and 
BCL2-associated athanogene 1 (BAG1) significantly reduced leukemia cell 
viability in vitro. Pharmacologic inhibition with dual small molecule inhibitor 
therapy targeting this pair of key nodes further demonstrated enhanced 
antileukemia efficacy of combining the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax with the 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors ruxolitinib or dasatinib in vitro in human Ph-like 
ALL cell lines and in vivo in multiple childhood Ph-like ALL patient-derived 
xenograft models. Consistent with network controllability theory, co-inhibitor 
treatment also shifted the transcriptomic state of Ph-like ALL cells to become 
less like kinase-activated BCR-ABL1-rearranged (Ph+) B-ALL and more similar to 
prognostically favorable childhood B-ALL subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents a powerful conceptual framework for 
combinatorial drug discovery based on systematic interrogation of synergistic 
vulnerability pathways with pharmacologic inhibitor validation in preclinical 
human leukemia models.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Coronary artery disease (CAD) poses a worldwide health 
threat. Compelling evidence shows that pericardial adipose tissue (PAT), a 
brown-like adipose adjacent to the external surface of the pericardium, is 
associated with CAD. However, the specific molecular mechanisms of PAT in CAD 
are elusive. This study aims to characterize human PAT and explore its 
association with CAD.
METHODS: We acquired samples of PAT from 31 elective cardiac surgery patients 
(17 CAD patients and 14 controls). The transcriptome characteristics were 
assessed in 5 CAD patients and 4 controls via RNA-sequencing. Cluster profile R 
package, String database, Cytoscape were applied to analyze the potential 
pathways and PPI-network key to DEGS, whereas the hubgenes were predicted via 
Metascape, Cytohubba, and MCODE. We use Cibersort, ENCORI, and DGIDB to predict 
immunoinfiltration, mRNA-miRNA target gene network, and search potential drugs 
targeting key DEGs. The predictable hubgenes and infiltrating inflammatory cells 
were validated in 22 patients (12 CAD samples and 10 control samples) through 
RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: A total of 147 different genes (104 up-regulated genes and 43 
down-regulated genes) were identified in CAD patients. These different genes 
were associated with immunity and inflammatory dysfunction. Cibersort analysis 
showed monocytes and macrophages were the most common subsets in immune cells, 
whereas immunohistochemical results revealed there were more macrophages and 
higher proportion of M1 subtype cells in PAT of CAD patients. The PPI network 
and module analysis uncovered several crucial genes, defined as candidate genes, 
including Jun, ATF3, CXCR4, FOSB, CCl4, which were validated through RT-qPCR. 
The miRNA-mRNA network implicated hsa-miR-185-5p as diagnostic targets and 
drug-gene network showed colchicine, fenofibrate as potential therapeutic drugs, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that PAT is mainly associated with the 
occurrence of CAD following the dysfunction of immune and inflammatory 
processes. The identified hubgenes, predicted drugs and miRNAs are promising 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CAD.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promote immunosuppressive activities in 
the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in increased tumor burden and 
diminishing the anti-tumor response of immunotherapies. While primary and 
metastatic tumors are typically the focal points of therapeutic development, the 
immune cells of the TME are differentially programmed by the tissue of the 
metastatic site. In particular, MDSCs are programmed uniquely within different 
organs in the context of tumor progression. Given that MDSC plasticity is shaped 
by the surrounding environment, the proteomes of MDSCs from different metastatic 
sites are hypothesized to be unique. A bottom-up proteomics approach using 
sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) was 
used to quantify the proteome of CD11b+ cells derived from murine liver 
metastases (LM) and lung metastases (LuM). A comparative proteomics workflow was 
employed to compare MDSC proteins from LuM (LuM-MDSC) and LM (LM-MDSC) while 
also elucidating common signaling pathways, protein function, and possible 
drug-protein interactions. SWATH-MS identified 2516 proteins from 200 µg of 
sample. Of the 2516 proteins, 2367 have matching transcriptomic data. 
Upregulated proteins from lung and liver-derived murine CD11b+ cells with 
matching mRNA transcriptomic data were categorized based on target knowledge and 
level of drug development. Comparative proteomic analysis demonstrates that 
liver and lung tumor-derived MDSCs have distinct proteomes that may be subject 
to pharmacologic manipulation.

More than 60% of supratentorial ependymomas harbor a ZFTA-RELA (ZRfus) gene 
fusion (formerly C11orf95-RELA). To study the biology of ZRfus, we developed an 
autochthonous mouse tumor model using in utero electroporation (IUE) of the 
embryonic mouse brain. Integrative epigenomic and transcriptomic mapping was 
performed on IUE-driven ZRfus tumors by CUT&RUN, chromatin immunoprecipitation 
sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing, and RNA 
sequencing and compared with human ZRfus-driven ependymoma. In addition to 
direct canonical NFκB pathway activation, ZRfus dictates a neoplastic 
transcriptional program and binds to thousands of unique sites across the genome 
that are enriched with PLAGL family transcription factor (TF) motifs. ZRfus 
activates gene expression programs through recruitment of transcriptional 
coactivators (Brd4, Ep300, Cbp, Pol2) that are amenable to pharmacologic 
inhibition. Downstream ZRfus target genes converge on developmental programs 
marked by PLAGL TF proteins, and activate neoplastic programs enriched in Mapk, 
focal adhesion, and gene imprinting networks. SIGNIFICANCE: Ependymomas are 
aggressive brain tumors. Although drivers of supratentorial ependymoma (ZFTA- 
and YAP1-associated gene fusions) have been discovered, their functions remain 
unclear. Our study investigates the biology of ZFTA-RELA-driven ependymoma, 
specifically mechanisms of transcriptional deregulation and direct downstream 
gene networks that may be leveraged for potential therapeutic testing.This

Epilepsy is a common disorder with complex inheritance, and its treatment is 
very unsatisfactory. An association between the GABRG2 C588T polymorphism and 
genetic generalized epilepsy has been studied by several genetic association 
studies. However, these results were inconsistent, and the role of GABRG2 in 
epilepsy treatment remains unknown. To evaluate the role of GABRG2 in epilepsy, 
we performed meta-analysis, expression quantitative trait loci analysis, 
protein-protein interaction analysis, and drug-gene interaction analysis. The 
combined results indicated that the GABRG2 C588T polymorphism was associated 
with genetic generalized epilepsy risk under dominant and allelic models (odds 
ratio [OR] = 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.54, p = 0.03, I2  = 0% 
and OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.03-1.42, p = 0.02, I2  = 20%, respectively). In the 
Asian population, we also found similar results under dominant and allelic 
models (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.18-3.16, p = 0.009, I2  = 0% and OR = 1.69, 95% 
CI = 1.20-2.37, p = 0.003, I2  = 11%, respectively). We first found that the 
GABRG2 C588T polymorphism regulates GABRG2 expression in human brain tissues and 
that the protein encoded by GABRG2 interacts with targets of approved 
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Interestingly, we also found that GABRG2 itself 
interacts with approved AEDs. Taken together, the results indicate that the 
C588T polymorphism might alter the GABAA receptor by modulating GABRG2 gene 
expression, resulting in increased risk for epilepsy, and that GABRG2 may be a 
potential therapeutic target for epilepsy.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In the present study, we investigated the differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs), pathways and immune cell infiltration characteristics of 
pediatric and adult ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: We conducted DEG analysis using the microarray dataset GSE87473 
containing 19 pediatric and 87 adult UC samples downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted 
using Metascape. We constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
and the drug-target interaction network of DEGs and identified hub modules and 
genes using Cytoscape and analyzed immune cell infiltration in pediatric and 
adult UC using CIBERSORT.
RESULTS: In total, 1700 DEGs were screened from the dataset. These genes were 
enriched mainly in inter-cellular items relating to cell junctions, cell 
adhesion, actin cytoskeleton and transmembrane receptor signaling pathways and 
intra-cellular items relating to the splicing, metabolism and localization of 
RNA. CDC42, POLR2A, RAC1, PIK3R1, MAPK1 and SRC were identified as hub DEGs. 
Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed higher proportions of naive B cells, 
resting memory T helper cells, regulatory T cells, monocytes, M0 macrophages and 
activated mast cells in pediatric UC, along with lower proportions of memory B 
cells, follicular helper T cells, γδ T cells, M2 macrophages, and activated 
dendritic cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that hub genes CDC42, POLR2A, RAC1, PIK3R1, 
MAPK1 and SRC and immune cells including B cells, T cells, monocytes, 
macrophages and mast cells play vital roles in the pathological differences 
between pediatric and adult UC and may serve as potential biomarkers in the 
diagnosis and treatment of UC.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a 
positive-strand RNA virus. The viral genome is capped at the 5' end, followed by 
an untranslated region (UTR). There is a poly(A) tail at the 3' end, preceded by 
a UTR. The self-interaction between the RNA regulatory elements present within 
the 5' and 3' UTRs and their interaction with host/virus-encoded proteins 
mediate the function of the 5' and 3' UTRs. Using an RNA-protein interaction 
detection (RaPID) assay coupled to liquid chromatography with tandem mass 
spectrometry, we identified host interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 5' and 3' 
UTRs and generated an RNA-protein interaction network. By combining these data 
with the previously known protein-protein interaction data proposed to be 
involved in virus replication, we generated the RNA-protein-protein interaction 
(RPPI) network, likely to be essential for controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication. 
Notably, bioinformatics analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of 
factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism. 
Lysosome-associated membrane protein-2a (Lamp2a), the receptor for 
chaperone-mediated autophagy, is one of the host proteins that interact with the 
5' UTR. Further studies showed that the Lamp2 level is upregulated in 
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and that the absence of the Lamp2a isoform enhanced 
the viral RNA level whereas its overexpression significantly reduced the viral 
RNA level. Lamp2a and viral RNA colocalize in the infected cells, and there is 
an increased autophagic flux in infected cells, although there is no change in 
the formation of autophagolysosomes. In summary, our study provides a useful 
resource of SARS-CoV-2 5' and 3' UTR binding proteins and reveals the role of 
Lamp2a protein during SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Replication of a 
positive-strand RNA virus involves an RNA-protein complex consisting of viral 
genomic RNA, host RNA(s), virus-encoded proteins, and host proteins. Dissecting 
out individual components of the replication complex will help decode the 
mechanism of viral replication. 5' and 3' UTRs in positive-strand RNA viruses 
play essential regulatory roles in virus replication. Here, we identified the 
host proteins that associate with the UTRs of SARS-CoV-2, combined those data 
with the previously known protein-protein interaction data (expected to be 
involved in virus replication), and generated the RNA-protein-protein 
interaction (RPPI) network. Analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment 
of factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism, which are 
important for virus replication. Analysis of one of the interaction partners of 
the 5'-UTR (Lamp2a) demonstrated its role in reducing the viral RNA level in 
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Collectively, our study provides a resource of 
SARS-CoV-2 UTR-binding proteins and identifies an important role for host Lamp2a 
protein during viral infection.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor has been identified as the key 
adhesion molecule for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. However, there is no 
evidence that human genetic variation in ACE2 is singularly responsible for 
COVID-19 susceptibility. Therefore, we performed an integrative multi-level 
characterization of genes that interact with ACE2 (ACE2-gene network) for their 
statistically enriched biological properties in the context of COVID-19. The 
phenome-wide association of 51 genes including ACE2 with 4,756 traits 
categorized into 26 phenotype categories, showed enrichment of immunological, 
respiratory, environmental, skeletal, dermatological, and metabolic domains (p < 
4e-4). Transcriptomic regulation of ACE2-gene network was enriched for 
tissue-specificity in kidney, small intestine, and colon (p < 4.7e-4). 
Leveraging the drug-gene interaction database we identified 47 drugs, including 
dexamethasone and spironolactone, among others. Considering genetic variants 
within ± 10 kb of ACE2-network genes we identified miRNAs whose binding sites 
may be altered as a consequence of genetic variation. The identified miRNAs 
revealed statistical over-representation of inflammation, aging, diabetes, and 
heart conditions. The genetic variant associations in RORA, SLC12A6, and SLC6A19 
genes were observed in genome-wide association study (GWAS) of COVID-19 
susceptibility. We also report the GWAS-identified variant in 3p21.31 locus, 
serves as trans-QTL for RORA and RORC genes. Overall, functional 
characterization of ACE2-gene network highlights several potential mechanisms in 
COVID-19 susceptibility. The data can also be accessed at

The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed huge threats 
to healthcare systems and the global economy. However, the host response towards 
COVID-19 on the molecular and cellular levels still lacks full understanding and 
effective therapies are in urgent need. Here, we integrate three datasets, 
GSE152641, GSE161777, and GSE157103. Compared to healthy people, 314 
differentially expressed genes were identified, which were mostly involved in 
neutrophil degranulation and cell division. The protein-protein network was 
established and two significant subsets were filtered by MCODE: ssGSEA and 
CIBERSORT, which comprehensively revealed the alternation of immune cell 
abundance. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) as well as GO and 
KEGG analyses unveiled the role of neutrophils and T cells during the progress 
of the disease. Based on the hospital-free days after 45 days of follow-up and 
statistical methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), submap, and 
linear correlation analysis, 31 genes were regarded as the signature of the 
peripheral blood of COVID-19. Various immune cells were identified to be related 
to the prognosis of the patients. Drugs were predicted for the genes in the 
signature by DGIdb. Overall, our study comprehensively revealed the relationship 
between the inflammatory response and the disease course, which provided 
strategies for the treatment of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing is a common disorder associated with 
significant morbidity. The genetic architecture of sleep-disordered breathing 
remains poorly understood. Through the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine 
(TOPMed) program, we performed the first whole-genome sequence analysis of 
sleep-disordered breathing.
METHODS: The study sample was comprised of 7988 individuals of diverse ancestry. 
Common-variant and pathway analyses included an additional 13,257 individuals. 
We examined five complementary traits describing different aspects of 
sleep-disordered breathing: the apnea-hypopnea index, average oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation per event, average and minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation across the 
sleep episode, and the percentage of sleep with oxyhemoglobin saturation < 90%. 
We adjusted for age, sex, BMI, study, and family structure using MMSKAT and 
EMMAX mixed linear model approaches. Additional bioinformatics analyses were 
performed with MetaXcan, GIGSEA, and ReMap.
RESULTS: We identified a multi-ethnic set-based rare-variant association (p = 
3.48 × 10-8) on chromosome X with ARMCX3. Additional rare-variant associations 
include ARMCX3-AS1, MRPS33, and C16orf90. Novel common-variant loci were 
identified in the NRG1 and SLC45A2 regions, and previously associated loci in 
the IL18RAP and ATP2B4 regions were associated with novel phenotypes. 
Transcription factor binding site enrichment identified associations with genes 
implicated with respiratory and craniofacial traits. Additional analyses 
identified significantly associated pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the first gene-based rare-variant associations 
with objectively measured sleep-disordered breathing traits. Our results 
increase the understanding of the genetic architecture of sleep-disordered 
breathing and highlight associations in genes that modulate lung development, 
inflammation, respiratory rhythmogenesis, and HIF1A-mediated hypoxic response.

COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), which infected >200 million people resulting in >4 million deaths. 
However, temporal landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 translatome and its impact on the 
human genome remain unexplored. Here, we report a high-resolution atlas of the 
translatome and transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 for various time points after 
infecting human cells. Intriguingly, substantial amount of SARS-CoV-2 
translation initiates at a novel translation initiation site (TIS) located in 
the leader sequence, termed TIS-L. Since TIS-L is included in all the genomic 
and subgenomic RNAs, the SARS-CoV-2 translatome may be regulated by a 
sophisticated interplay between TIS-L and downstream TISs. TIS-L functions as a 
strong translation enhancer for ORF S, and as translation suppressors for most 
of the other ORFs. Our global temporal atlas provides compelling insight into 
unique regulation of the SARS-CoV-2 translatome and helps comprehensively 
evaluate its impact on the human genome.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is one of the principal causes of tumor-related 
death worldwide. CXC chemokines, a subfamily of functional chemotactic peptides, 
affect the initiation of tumor cells and clinical outcomes in several human 
malignant tumors. However, the specific biological functions and clinical 
significance of CXC chemokines in pancreatic cancer have not been clarified.
METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis tools and databases, including ONCOMINE, 
GEPIA2, the Human Protein Atlas, DAVID, GeneMANIA, cBioPortal, STRING, DGidb, 
MethSurv, TRRUST, SurvExpress, SurvivalMeth, and TIMER, were utilized to clarify 
the clinical significance and biological functions of CXC chemokine in 
pancreatic cancer.
RESULTS: Except for CXCL11/12, the transcriptional levels of other CXC 
chemokines in PAAD tissues were significantly elevated, and the expression level 
of CXCL16 was the highest among these CXC chemokines. Our findings also 
suggested that all of the CXC chemokines were linked to tumor-immune dysfunction 
involving the abundance of immune cell infiltration, and the Cox proportional 
hazard model confirmed that dendritic and CXCL3/5/7/8/11/17 were significantly 
associated with the clinical outcome of PAAD patients. Furthermore, increasing 
expressions of CXCL5/9/10/11/17 were related to unfavorable overall survival 
(OS), and only CXCL17 was a prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) in 
PAAD patients. The expression pattern and prognostic power of CXC chemokines 
were further validated in the independent GSE62452 dataset. For the prognostic 
value of single CpG of DNA methylation of CXC chemokines in patients with PAAD, 
we identified 3 CpGs of CXCL1, 2 CpGs of CXCL2, 2 CpGs of CXCL3, 3 CpGs of 
CXCL4, 10 CpGs of CXCL5, 1 CpG of CXCL6, 1 CpG of CXCL7, 3 CpGs of CXCL12, 3 
CpGs of CXCL14, and 5 CpGs of CXCL17 that were significantly associated with 
prognosis in PAAD patients. Moreover, the prognostic value of CXC chemokine 
signature in PAAD was explored and tested in two independent cohort, and results 
indicated that the patients in the low-risk group had a better OS compared with 
the high-risk group. Survival analysis of the DNA methylation of CXC chemokine 
signature demonstrated that PAAD patients in the high-risk group had longer 
survival times.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the novel insights into CXC chemokine 
expression and their biological functions in the pancreatic cancers, which might 
serve as accurate prognostic biomarkers and suitable immunotherapeutic targets 
for patients with pancreatic cancer.

The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
pandemic has emphasized the vulnerability of human populations to novel viral 
pressures, despite the vast array of epidemiological and biomedical tools now 
available. Notably, modern human genomes contain evolutionary information 
tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses 
that have impacted our ancestors-pointing to which viruses have future pandemic 
potential. Here, we apply evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to 
recover selection events involving tens of human genes that interact with 
coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that likely started more than 20,000 years 
ago. These adaptive events were limited to the population ancestral to East 
Asian populations. Multiple lines of functional evidence support an ancient 
viral selective pressure, and East Asia is the geographical origin of several 
modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an ancient coronavirus, or with 
a different virus that happened to use similar interactions as coronaviruses 
with human hosts, may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations. 
By learning more about our ancient viral foes, our study highlights the promise 
of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future. 
Importantly, adaptation to ancient viral epidemics in specific human populations 
does not necessarily imply any difference in genetic susceptibility between 
different human populations, and the current evidence points toward an 
overwhelming impact of socioeconomic factors in the case of coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19).

Liver metastasis of colorectal cancer (LMCRC) severely damages patient health, 
causing poor prognosis and tumor relapse. Marker genes associated with LMCRC 
identified by previous study did not meet therapeutic demand. Therefore, it is 
necessary to identify new biomarkers regulating the metastasis network and 
screen potential drugs for future treatment. Here, we identified that cell 
adhesion molecules and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) 
signaling pathway were significantly enriched by analyzing the 
integrated-multiple expression profiles. Moreover, analysis with robust rank 
aggregation approach revealed a total of 138 differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs), including 108 upexpressed and 30 downexpressed genes. With establishing 
protein-protein interaction network, we also identified the subnetwork 
significantly enriching the metastasis-associated hub genes including ALB, APOE, 
CDH2, and ORM1. ESR2, FOXO3, and SRY were determined as key transcription 
factors regulating hub genes. In addition, ADH-1, epigallocatechin, 
CHEMBL1945287, and cochinchinenin C were predicted as potential therapeutic 
drugs. Moreover, the antimigration capacity of ADH-1 and epigallocatechin were 
confirmed in CRC cell lines. In conclusion, our findings not only offer 
opportunities to understand metastasis mechanism but also identify potential 
therapeutic targets for CRC.

The return of blood flow to ischemic heart after myocardial infarction causes 
ischemia-reperfusion injury. There is a clinical need for novel therapeutic 
targets to treat myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here we screened for 
targets for the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury using a combination of 
shRNA and drug library analyses in HL-1 mouse cardiomyocytes subjected to 
hypoxia and reoxygenation. The shRNA library included lentiviral constructs 
targeting 4625 genes and the drug library 689 chemical compounds approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Data were analyzed using protein-protein 
interaction and pathway analyses. EGFR inhibition was identified as a 
cardioprotective mechanism in both approaches. Inhibition of EGFR kinase 
activity with gefitinib improved cardiomyocyte viability in vitro. In addition, 
gefitinib preserved cardiac contractility in zebrafish embryos exposed to 
hypoxia-reoxygenation in vivo. These findings indicate that the EGFR inhibitor 
gefitinib is a potential candidate for further studies of repurposing the drug 
for the treatment of myocardial infarction.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms 
associated with ischemic stroke through the construction of a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA 
network. miRNA expression profile in GSE55937, mRNA and lncRNA expression 
profiles in GSE122709, and mRNA expression profile in GSE146882 were downloaded 
from the NCBI GEO database. After the identification of the differentially 
expressed miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA using GSE55937 and GSE122709 in ischemic 
stroke vs. control groups, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was 
constructed. The lncRNA-miRNA, lncRNA-mRNA, and miRNA-mRNA pairs were predicted, 
and a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed. Additionally, the gene-drug 
interactions were predicted. Characteristic genes were used to construct a 
support vector machine (SVM) model and verified using quantitative reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction. In total 38 miRNAs, 115 lncRNAs, and 
990 mRNAs were identified between ischemic stroke and control groups. A PPI 
network with 371 nodes and 2306 interaction relationships was constructed. The 
constructed lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network contained 7 mRNAs, 14 lncRNAs, such as 
SND1-IT1, NAPA-AS1, LINC01001, LUCAT1, and ASAP1-IT2, and 8 miRNAs, such as 
miR-93-3p and miR-24-3p. The drug action analysis of the seven differential 
mRNAs included in the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network showed that four genes (GPR17, 
ADORA1, OPRM1 and LPAR3) were predicted as molecular targets of drugs. The area 
under the curve of the constructed SVM model was 0.886. The verification results 
of the relative expression of RNA by qRT-PCR were consistent with the results of 
bioinformatics analysis. LPAR3, ADORA1, GPR17, and OPRM1 may serve as 
therapeutic targets of ischemic stroke. lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis such 
as SND1-IT1/NAPA-AS1/LINC01001-miR-24-3p-LPAR3/ADORA1 and 
LUCAT1/ASAP1-IT2-miR-93-3p-GPR17 may play important roles in the progression of 
ischemic stroke.

Background: The failure of the embryonic hyaloid vascular system to regress 
naturally causes persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), a congenital 
eye disease. PHPVs molecular pathway, candidate genes, and drug targets are 
unknown. The current paper describes a comprehensive analysis using 
bioinformatics to identify the key genes and molecular pathways associated with 
PHPV, and to evaluate potential therapeutic agents for disease management. 
Methods: The genes associated with PHPV were identified using the pubmed2ensembl 
text mining platform. GeneCodis was employed to evaluate the Gene Ontology (GO) 
biological process terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathways. Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) 
constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network from the text mining 
genes (TMGs) in Cytoscape. The significant modules were clustered using 
Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE), and the GO and KEGG analysis for the hub 
genes were analyzed with the Database of Annotation, Visualization and 
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool. ClueGO, CluePedia, and ShinyGo were used to 
illustrate the functions and pathways of the clustered hub genes in a 
significant module. The Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb) was used to 
evaluate drug-gene interactions of the hub genes to identify potential PHPV drug 
candidates. Results: A total of 50 genes associated with PHPV were identified. 
Overall, 35 enriched GO terms and 15 KEGG pathways were discovered by the gene 
functional enrichment analysis. Two gene modules were obtained from the PPI 
network constructed with 31 nodes with 42 edges using MCODE. We selected 14 hub 
genes as core candidate genes: TP53, VEGFA, SMAD2, CDKN2A, FOXC, FZD4, LRP5, 
KDR, FZD5, PAX6, MYCN, NDP, PITX2, and PAX2, primarily associated with 
camera-type eye morphogenesis, pancreatic cancer, the apoptotic process involved 
in morphogenesis, and the VEGF receptor signaling pathway. We discovered that 26 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs could target 7 of the 14 hub 
genes. Conclusions: In conclusion, the results revealed a total of 14 potential 
genes, 4 major pathways, 7 drug gene targets, and 26 candidate drugs that could 
provide the basis of novel targeted therapies for targeted treatment and 
management of PHPV.

Autoimmune diseases (AiDs) are complex heterogeneous diseases characterized by 
hyperactive immune responses against self. Genome-wide association studies have 
identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
several AiDs. While these studies have identified a handful of pleiotropic loci 
that confer risk to multiple AiDs, they lack the power to detect shared genetic 
factors residing outside of these loci. Here, we integrated chromatin contact, 
expression quantitative trait loci and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data to 
identify genes that are regulated by both pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic SNPs. 
The PPI analysis revealed complex interactions between the shared and 
disease-specific genes. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated 
that the shared genes co-occur with disease-specific genes within the same 
biological pathways. In conclusion, our results are consistent with the 
hypothesis that genetic risk loci associated with multiple AiDs converge on a 
core set of biological processes that potentially contribute to the emergence of 
polyautoimmunity.

Epilepsy (affects about 70 million people worldwide) is one of the most 
prevalent brain disorders and imposes a huge economic burden on society. 
Epilepsy has a strong genetic component. In this study, we perform the largest 
genome-wide meta-analysis of epilepsy (N = 8,00,869 subjects) by integrating 
four large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of epilepsy. We 
identified three genome-wide significant (GWS) (p < 5 × 10-8) risk loci for 
epilepsy. The risk loci on 7q21.11 [lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
rs11978015, p = 9.26 × 10-9] and 8p23.1 (lead SNP rs28634186, p = 4.39 × 10-8) 
are newly identified in the present study. Of note, rs11978015 resides in 
upstream of GRM3, which encodes glutamate metabotropic receptor 3. GRM3 has 
pivotal roles in neurotransmission and is involved in most aspects of normal 
brain function. In addition, we also identified three genes (TTC21B, 
RP11-375N15.2, and TNKS) whose cis-regulated expression level are associated 
with epilepsy, indicating that risk variants may confer epilepsy risk through 
regulating the expression of these genes. Our study not only provides new 
insights into genetic architecture of epilepsy but also prioritizes potential 
molecular targets (including GRM3 and TTC21B) for development of new drugs and 
therapeutics for epilepsy.

The mechanisms driving clonal heterogeneity and evolution in relapsed pediatric 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are not fully understood. We performed whole 
genome sequencing of samples collected at diagnosis, relapse(s) and remission 
from 29 Nordic patients. Somatic point mutations and large-scale structural 
variants were called using individually matched remission samples as controls, 
and allelic expression of the mutations was assessed in ALL cells using 
RNA-sequencing. We observed an increased burden of somatic mutations at relapse, 
compared to diagnosis, and at second relapse compared to first relapse. In 
addition to 29 known ALL driver genes, of which nine genes carried recurrent 
protein-coding mutations in our sample set, we identified putative non-protein 
coding mutations in regulatory regions of seven additional genes that have not 
previously been described in ALL. Cluster analysis of hundreds of somatic 
mutations per sample revealed three distinct evolutionary trajectories during 
ALL progression from diagnosis to relapse. The evolutionary trajectories provide 
insight into the mutational mechanisms leading relapse in ALL and could offer 
biomarkers for improved risk prediction in individual patients.

Inactivating mutations in the Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene are the 
main cause of Rett syndrome (RTT). Despite extensive research into MECP2 
function, no treatments for RTT are currently available. Here, we used an 
evolutionary genomics approach to construct an unbiased MECP2 gene network, 
using 1028 eukaryotic genomes to prioritize proteins with strong co-evolutionary 
signatures with MECP2. Focusing on proteins targeted by FDA-approved drugs led 
to three promising targets, two of which were previously linked to MECP2 
function (IRAK, KEAP1) and one that was not (EPOR). The drugs targeting these 
three proteins (Pacritinib, DMF, and EPO) were able to rescue different 
phenotypes of MECP2 inactivation in cultured human neural cell types, and 
appeared to converge on Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in 
inflammation. This study highlights the potential of comparative genomics to 
accelerate drug discovery, and yields potential new avenues for the treatment of 
RTT.

Mutual Exclusivity analysis of genomic aberrations contributes to the 
exploration of potential synthetic lethal (SL) relationships thus guiding the 
nomination of specific cancer cells vulnerabilities. When multiple classes of 
genomic aberrations and large cohorts of patients are interrogated, exhaustive 
genome-wide analyses are not computationally feasible with commonly used 
approaches. Here we present Fast Mutual Exclusivity (FaME), an algorithm based 
on matrix multiplication that employs a logarithm-based implementation of the 
Fisher's exact test to achieve fast computation of genome-wide mutual 
exclusivity tests; we show that brute force testing for mutual exclusivity of 
hundreds of millions of aberrations combinations can be performed in few 
minutes. We applied FaME to allele-specific data from whole exome experiments of 
27 TCGA studies cohorts, detecting both mutual exclusivity of point mutations, 
as well as allele-specific copy number signals that span sets of contiguous 
cytobands. We next focused on a case study involving the loss of tumor 
suppressors and druggable genes while exploiting an integrated analysis of both 
public cell lines loss of function screens data and patients' transcriptomic 
profiles. FaME algorithm implementation as well as allele-specific analysis 
output are publicly available at https://github.com/demichelislab/FaME.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the replication of influenza A virus A/Puerto 
Rico/8/34 (H1N1) in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and its effect on 
endothelial barrier function.
METHODS: Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were infected with 
influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. Plaque reduction assay, real-time 
quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and western blot were used to 
elucidate the replication process of virus-infected endothelial cells. In 
addition, real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the relative expression 
levels of mRNA of some inflammatory factors. The endothelial resistance assay 
was used to determine the permeability of the endothelial monolayer. Excavation 
and analysis of data from open databases, such as the GeneCards database, DAVID 
Bioinformatics Resources, STRING search tool, and DGIdb database determined the 
genes, proteins, and signal pathways related to microvascular leakage caused by 
the H1N1 virus, and predicted the drugs that could be effective for treatment.
RESULTS: In vitro experiments showed that the influenza virus can infect 
endothelial cells, leading to a significant increase in the permeability of 
pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells and the release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, but does not efficiently replicate in endothelial cells. A total of 
107 disease-related target genes were obtained from the Gene-cards database. 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that 
these genes mainly affected the pathways related to "Inflammatory bowel disease" 
(IBD), "Chagas disease" (American trypanosomiasis), "Influenza A", and also 
played a key role in anti-inflammation and regulation of immunity. After 
enrichment analysis, 46 hub genes were screened. A total of 42 FDA-approved 
drugs corresponding to the hub genes were screened from the DGIdb database, and 
these could be formulated for topical application. In addition, these drugs can 
be used to treat other diseases, including cancer, inflammatory diseases, immune 
system disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.
CONCLUSION: H1N1 influenza virus affects the barrier function of endothelial 
cells indirectly. Combined with bioinformatics tools, we can better understand 
the possible mechanism of action of influenza A (H1N1) virus causing pulmonary 
microvascular leakage and provide new clues for the treatment of pulmonary 
microvascular leakage.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological subtype 
of lung cancer (LC). However, the early-stage diagnostic rate is still low, and 
the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate remains poor. The present study aimed to 
identify critical genes as diagnostic and prognostic markers and small-molecule 
drugs for combating LUAD using a systematic bioinformatics analysis.
METHODS: Five gene expression profiling datasets were systematically integrated 
and analyzed. First, gene coexpression modules were identified, and 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened. Second, the functional 
changes of these DEGs were systematically investigated. Third, the 
protein-protein interaction network, high correlation module and key genes were 
identified. Fourth, prognosis and diagnostic analyses were performed. Fifth, 
small-molecule drugs were predicted for guiding LUAD therapy.
RESULTS: Finally, 12-gene and 2-gene signatures were identified as diagnostic 
and prognostic markers. The areas under the curves (AUCs) of two signatures 
associated with 3-year survival were 0.686 and 0.603, respectively. The AUCs of 
two signatures were over 95% and 94% in diagnostic model, separately. Eleven 
small-molecule drugs were found and irinotecan was simultaneously predicted in 
three drug databases.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified some key dysregulated genes involved 
in LUAD and potential drugs by a comprehensive analysis, which provides novel 
insights into the pathological mechanism involved in LUAD and may shed light on 
the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of LUAD patients.

PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a public chemical database that 
serves scientific communities as well as the general public. This database 
collects chemical information from hundreds of data sources and organizes them 
into multiple data collections, including Substance, Compound, BioAssay, 
Protein, Gene, Pathway, and Patent. These collections are interlinked with each 
other, allowing users to discover related records in the various collections 
(e.g., drugs targeting a protein or genes modulated by a chemical). PubChem can 
be searched by keyword (e.g., a chemical, protein, or gene name) as well as by 
chemical structure. The input structure can be provided using popular line 
notations or drawn with the PubChem Sketcher. PubChem supports various types of 
structure searches, including identity search, 2-D and 3-D similarity searches, 
and substructure and superstructure searches. Results from multiple searches can 
be combined using Boolean operators (i.e., AND, OR, and NOT) to formulate 
complex queries. PubChem allows the user to quickly retrieve a list of records 
annotated with a particular classification or ontological term. This paper 
provides step-by-step instructions on how to explore PubChem data with examples 
of commonly requested tasks. © 2021. This article is a U.S. Government work and

Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) often show increased risk-taking propensity, 
which may contribute to poor clinical outcome. While these two phenotypes are 
genetically correlated, there is scarce knowledge on the shared genetic 
determinants. Using GWAS datasets on BD (41,917 BD cases and 371,549 controls) 
and risk-taking (n = 466,571), we dissected shared genetic determinants using 
conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) and local genetic covariance 
analysis. We investigated specificity of identified targets using GWAS datasets 
on schizophrenia (SCZ) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The 
putative functional role of identified targets was evaluated using different 
tools and GTEx v. 8. Target druggability was evaluated using DGIdb and 
enrichment for drug targets with genome for REPositioning drugs (GREP). Among 
102 loci shared between BD and risk-taking, 87% showed the same direction of 
effect. Sixty-two were specifically shared between risk-taking propensity and 
BD, while the others were also shared between risk-taking propensity and either 
SCZ or ADHD. By leveraging pleiotropic enrichment, we reported 15 novel and 
specific loci associated with BD and 22 with risk-taking. Among cross-disorder 
genes, CACNA1C (a known target of calcium channel blockers) was significantly 
associated with risk-taking propensity and both BD and SCZ using conjFDR 
(p = 0.001 for both) as well as local genetic covariance analysis, and predicted 
to be differentially expressed in the cerebellar hemisphere in an eQTL-informed 
gene-based analysis (BD, Z = 7.48, p = 3.8E-14; risk-taking: Z = 4.66, 
p = 1.6E-06). We reported for the first time shared genetic determinants between 
BD and risk-taking propensity. Further investigation into calcium channel 
blockers or development of innovative ligands of calcium channels might form the 
basis for innovative pharmacotherapy in patients with BD with increased 
risk-taking propensity.

Chronic stress leads to the activation of the beta-adrenergic pathway. Its 
activation has been implicated in the progression of different types of cancer 
but its role on head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) remains 
undefined. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the 
beta-adrenergic pathway activation in the progression of HNSCCs and offer a 
panel of potential treatments for patients with the active beta-adrenergic 
pathway. Five hundred and twenty TCGA patients with primary HNSCCs were divided 
in two groups: ADRB2low / SLC6A2low and ADRB2high / SLC6A2high. Differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through differential expression analysis. 
The association of clinicopathological and genomic features between the groups 
was analyzed using a bioinformatic approach. Potential drugs for treatment of 
HNSCC were identified based on the DEGs. There was association between ADRB2 and 
SLC6A2 expressions with age, race, tumor site, histologic grade, perineural 
invasion, and HPV p16 status. It was identified 898 DEGs between the groups. 
High ADRB2/SLC6A2 expression stimulated HNSCC proliferation, adhesion, invasion, 
and angiogenesis. On the other hand, genes related to cell stemness were 
downregulated in patients with activation of the beta- adrenergic pathway. 
Finally, 56 FDA-approved antineoplastic and immunotherapeutic drugs were 
identified as potential targets for the personalized treatment.

BACKGROUND: The cohesin complex plays an essential role in genome organisation 
and cell division. A full complement of the cohesin complex and its regulators 
is important for normal development, since heterozygous mutations in genes 
encoding these components can be sufficient to produce a disease phenotype. The 
implication that genes encoding the cohesin subunits or cohesin regulators must 
be tightly controlled and resistant to variability in expression has not yet 
been formally tested.
METHODS: Here, we identify spatial-regulatory connections with potential to 
regulate expression of cohesin loci (Mitotic: SMC1A, SMC3, STAG1, STAG2, 
RAD21/RAD21-AS; Meiotic: SMC1B, STAG3, REC8, RAD21L1), cohesin-ring support 
genes (NIPBL, MAU2, WAPL, PDS5A, PDS5B) and CTCF, including linking their 
expression to that of other genes. We searched the genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) catalogue for SNPs mapped or attributed to cohesin genes by GWAS 
(GWAS-attributed) and the GTEx catalogue for SNPs mapped to cohesin genes by 
cis-regulatory variants in one or more of 44 tissues across the human body 
(expression quantitative trail locus-attributed).
RESULTS: Connections that centre on the cohesin ring subunits provide evidence 
of coordinated regulation that has little tolerance for perturbation. We used 
the CoDeS3D SNP-gene attribution methodology to identify transcriptional changes 
across a set of genes coregulated with the cohesin loci that include biological 
pathways such as extracellular matrix production and proteasome-mediated protein 
degradation. Remarkably, many of the genes that are coregulated with cohesin 
loci are themselves intolerant to loss-of-function.
CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of robust regulation of 
cohesin genes and implicate novel pathways that may be important in the human 
cohesinopathy disorders.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental 
disorder with only symptomatic care available. Genome-wide association (GWA) 
studies can provide a starting point in the search for novel drug targets and 
possibilities of drug repurposing. Here, we explored the druggable genome in 
ADHD by utilising GWA studies on ADHD and its co-morbid conditions. First, we 
explored whether the genes targeted by current ADHD drugs show association with 
the disorder and/or its co-morbidities. Second, we aimed to identify genes and 
pathways involved in the biological processes underlying ADHD that can be 
targeted by pharmacological agents. These ADHD-associated druggable genes and 
pathways were also examined in co-morbidities of ADHD, as commonalities in their 
aetiology and management may lead to novel pharmacological insights. Strikingly, 
none of the genes encoding targets of first-line pharmacotherapeutics for ADHD 
were significantly associated with the disorder, suggesting that FDA-approved 
ADHD drugs may act through different mechanisms than those underlying ADHD. In 
the examined druggable genome, three loci on chromosomes 1, 4 and 12 revealed 
significant association with ADHD and contained nine druggable genes, five of 
which encode established drug targets for malignancies, autoimmune and 
neurodevelopmental disorders. To conclude, we present a framework to assess the 
druggable genome in a disorder, exemplified by ADHD. We highlight signal 
transduction and cell adhesion as potential novel avenues for ADHD treatment. 
Our findings add to knowledge on known ADHD drugs and present the exploration of 
druggable genome associated with ADHD, which may offer interventions at the 
aetiological level of the disorder.

The steady increase in global cancer burden has fuelled the development of 
several modes of treatment for the disease. In the presence of an actionable 
mutation, targeted therapies offer a method to selectively attack cancer cells, 
increasing overall efficacy and reducing harmful side effects. However, 
different drug molecules are in different stages of development, with new 
molecules obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies each year. To augment 
clinical impact, it is important that this information reaches clinicians, 
patients and researchers swiftly and in a structured, well-annotated manner. To 
this end, we have developed Mutation-Specific Therapies Resource and Database in 
Cancer (MUSTARD), a database that is designed to be a centralized resource with 
diverse information such as cancer subtype, associated mutations, therapy 
offered and its effect observed, along with links to external resources for a 
more comprehensive annotation. In its current version, MUSTARD comprises over 
2105 unique entries, including associations between 418 unique drug therapies, 
189 cancer subtypes and 167 genes curated and annotated from over 862 different 
publications. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only resource that offers 
comprehensive information on mutation-specific, gene fusions and overexpressed 
gene-targeted therapies for cancer. Database URL:

The role of cis-elements and their aberrations remains unclear in esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, further abbreviated EC). Here we survey 28 
H3K27ac-marked active enhancer profiles and 50 transcriptomes in primary EC, 
metastatic lymph node cancer (LNC), and adjacent normal (Nor) esophageal 
tissues. Thousands of gained or lost enhancers and hundreds of altered putative 
super-enhancers are identified in EC and LNC samples respectively relative to 
Nor, with a large number of common gained or lost enhancers. Moreover, these 
differential enhancers contribute to the transcriptomic aberrations in ECs and 
LNCs. We also reveal putative driver onco-transcription factors, depletion of 
which diminishes cell proliferation and migration. The administration of 
chemical inhibitors to suppress the predicted targets of gained super-enhances 
reveals HSP90AA1 and PDE4B as potential therapeutic targets for ESCC. Thus, our 
epigenomic profiling reveals a compendium of reprogrammed cis-regulatory 
elements during ESCC carcinogenesis and metastasis for uncovering promising 
targets for cancer treatment.

Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is an intra-epidermal adenocarcinoma. Till 
now, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of scrotal EMPD is poorly known. 
This present study aims to explore the knowledge of molecular mechanism of 
scrotal EMPD by identifying the hub genes and candidate drugs using integrated 
bioinformatics approaches. Firstly, the microarray datasets (GSE117285) were 
downloaded from the GEO database and then analyzed using GEO2R in order to 
obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Moreover, hub genes were 
identified on the basis of their degree of connectivity using Cytohubba plugin 
of cytoscape tool. Finally, GEPIA and DGIdb were used for the survival analysis 
and selection of therapeutic candidates, respectively. A total of 786 DEGs were 
identified, of which 10 genes were considered as hub genes on the basis of the 
highest degree of connectivity. After the survival analysis of ten hub genes, a 
total of 5 genes were found to be altered in EMPD patients. Furthermore, 14 
drugs of CHEK1, CCNA2, and CDK1 were found to have therapeutic potential against 
EMPD. This study updates the information and yields a new perspective in the 
context of understanding the pathogenesis of EMPD. In future, hub genes and 
candidate drugs might be capable of improving the personalized detection and 
therapies for EMPD.

Breast cancer (BC) is a common disease and one of the main causes of death in 
females worldwide. In the omics era, researchers have used various 
high-throughput sequencing technologies to accumulate massive amounts of 
biomedical data and reveal an increasing number of disease-related 
mutations/genes. It is a major challenge to use these data effectively to find 
drugs that may protect human health. In this study, we combined the GeneRank 
algorithm and gene dependency network to propose a precision drug discovery 
strategy that can recommend drugs for individuals and screen existing drugs that 
could be used to treat different BC subtypes. We used this strategy to screen 
four BC subtype-specific drug combinations and verified the potential activity 
of combining gefitinib and irinotecan in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
through in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results of cell and animal 
experiments demonstrated that the combination of gefitinib and irinotecan can 
significantly inhibit the growth of TNBC tumour cells. The results also 
demonstrated that this systems pharmacology-based precision drug discovery 
strategy effectively identified important disease-related genes in individuals 
and special groups, which supports its efficiency, high reliability, and 
practical application value in drug discovery.

In silico models of biomolecular regulation in cancer, annotated with 
patient-specific gene expression data, can aid in the development of novel 
personalized cancer therapeutic strategies. Drosophila melanogaster is a 
well-established animal model that is increasingly being employed to evaluate 
such preclinical personalized cancer therapies. Here, we report five Boolean 
network models of biomolecular regulation in cells lining the Drosophila midgut 
epithelium and annotate them with colorectal cancer patient-specific mutation 
data to develop an in silico Drosophila Patient Model (DPM). We employed 
cell-type-specific RNA-seq gene expression data from the FlyGut-seq database to 
annotate and then validate these networks. Next, we developed three 
literature-based colorectal cancer case studies to evaluate cell fate outcomes 
from the model. Results obtained from analyses of the proposed DPM help: (i) 
elucidate cell fate evolution in colorectal tumorigenesis, (ii) validate 
cytotoxicity of nine FDA-approved CRC drugs, and (iii) devise optimal 
personalized treatment combinations. The personalized network models helped 
identify synergistic combinations of paclitaxel-regorafenib, 
paclitaxel-bortezomib, docetaxel-bortezomib, and paclitaxel-imatinib for 
treating different colorectal cancer patients. Follow-on therapeutic screening 
of six colorectal cancer patients from cBioPortal using this drug combination 
demonstrated a 100% increase in apoptosis and a 100% decrease in proliferation. 
In conclusion, this work outlines a novel roadmap for decoding colorectal 
tumorigenesis along with the development of personalized combinatorial 
therapeutics for preclinical translational studies.

Neuroinflammation, as defined by the presence of classically activated 
microglia, is thought to play a key role in numerous neurodegenerative disorders 
such as Alzheimer's disease. While modulating neuroinflammation could prove 
beneficial against neurodegeneration, identifying its most relevant biological 
processes and pharmacological targets remains highly challenging. In the present 
study, we combined text-mining, functional enrichment and protein-level 
functional interaction analyses to 1) identify the proteins significantly 
associated to neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease over the scientific 
literature, 2) distinguish the key proteins most likely to control the 
neuroinflammatory processes significantly associated to Alzheimer's disease, 3) 
identify their regulatory microRNAs among those dysregulated in Alzheimer's 
disease and 4) assess their pharmacological targetability. 94 proteins were 
found to be significantly associated to neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease 
over the scientific literature and IL4, IL10 and IL13 signaling as well as 
TLR-mediated MyD88- and TRAF6-dependent responses were their most significantly 
enriched biological processes. IL10, TLR4, IL6, AKT1, CRP, IL4, CXCL8, 
TNF-alpha, ITGAM, CCL2 and NOS3 were identified as the most potent regulators of 
the functional interaction network formed by these immune processes. These key 
proteins were indexed to be regulated by 63 microRNAs dysregulated in 
Alzheimer's disease, 13 long non-coding RNAs and targetable by 55 small 
molecules and 8 protein-based therapeutics. In conclusion, our study identifies 
eleven key proteins with the highest ability to control neuroinflammatory 
processes significantly associated to Alzheimer's disease, as well as 
pharmacological compounds with single or pleiotropic actions acting on them. As 
such, it may facilitate the prioritization of diagnostic and target-engagement 
biomarkers as well as the development of effective therapeutic strategies 
against neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related human death. It is a 
heterogeneous disease, classified in two main histotypes, small-cell lung cancer 
(SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is further subdivided into 
squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AD) subtypes. Despite the 
introduction of innovative therapeutics, mainly designed to specifically treat 
AD patients, the prognosis of lung cancer remains poor. In particular, available 
treatments for SCLC and SCC patients are currently limited to platinum-based 
chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this work, we used an 
integrative approach to identify novel vulnerabilities in lung cancer. First, we 
compared the data from a CRISPR/Cas9 dependency screening performed in our 
laboratory with Cancer Dependency Map Project data, essentiality comprising 
information on 73 lung cancer cell lines. Next, to identify relevant therapeutic 
targets, we integrated dependency data with pharmacological data and TCGA gene 
expression information. Through this analysis, we identified CSNK1A1, KDM2A, and 
LTB4R2 as relevant druggable essentiality genes in lung cancer. We validated the 
antiproliferative effect of genetic or pharmacological inhibition of these genes 
in two lung cancer cell lines. Overall, our results identified new 
vulnerabilities associated with different lung cancer histotypes, laying the 
basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

There is evidence pointing towards shared etiological features between type 1 
diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) despite both phenotypes being 
considered genetically distinct. However, the existence of shared genetic 
features for T1D and T2D remains complex and poorly defined. To better 
understand the link between T1D and T2D, we employed an integrated functional 
genomics approach involving extensive chromatin interaction data (Hi-C) and 
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to characterize the 
tissue-specific impacts of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with T1D 
and T2D. We identified 195 pleiotropic genes that are modulated by 
tissue-specific spatial eQTLs associated with both T1D and T2D. The pleiotropic 
genes are enriched in inflammatory and metabolic pathways that include 
mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, pertussis toxin signaling, and the 
Parkinson's disease pathway. We identified 8 regulatory elements within the 
TCF7L2 locus that modulate transcript levels of genes involved in immune 
regulation as well as genes important in the etiology of T2D. Despite the 
observed gene and pathway overlaps, there was no significant genetic correlation 
between variant effects on T1D and T2D risk using European ancestral summary 
data. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that T1D and T2D 
specific genetic variants act through genetic regulatory mechanisms to alter the 
regulation of common genes, and genes that co-locate in biological pathways, to 
mediate pleiotropic effects on disease development. Crucially, a high risk 
genetic profile for T1D alters biological pathways that increase the risk of 
developing both T1D and T2D. The same is not true for genetic profiles that 
increase the risk of developing T2D. The conversion of information on genetic 
susceptibility to the protein pathways that are altered provides an important 
resource for repurposing or designing novel therapies for the management of 
diabetes.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify potential circular ribonucleic acid 
(circRNA) signatures involved in the pathogenesis of early-stage lung 
adenocarcinoma (LAC).
METHODS: The circRNA sequencing dataset of early-stage LAC was downloaded from 
the Gene Expression Omnibus database. First, the differentially expressed 
circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) between tumour and non-tumour tissues were screened. Then, 
the corresponding miRNAs and their target genes were predicted. In addition, 
prognosis-related genes were identified using survival analysis and further used 
to build a network of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs; 
DEcircRNA-miRNA-mRNA). Finally, the functional analysis and drug-gene 
interaction analysis of mRNAs in the ceRNA network was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 35 DEcircRNAs (30 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated 
circRNAs) were identified. Moreover, 135 DEcircRNA-miRNA and 674 miRNA-mRNA 
pairs were predicted. The survival analysis of these target mRNAs revealed that 
60 genes were significantly associated with survival outcomes in early-stage 
LAC. Of these, high levels of PSMA 5 and low levels of NAMPT, CPT 2 and TNFSF11 
exhibited favourable prognoses. In addition, the DEcircRNA-miRNA-mRNA network 
was constructed, containing 5 miRNA-circRNA 
(hsa_circ_0092283/hsa-miR-762/hsa-miR-4685-5p; 
hsa_circ_0070610/hsa-let-7a-2-3p/hsa-miR-3622a-3p; 
hsa_circ_0062682/hsa-miR-4268) and 60 miRNA-mRNA pairs. Functional analysis of 
the genes in the ceRNA network showed that they were primarily enriched in the 
Wnt signalling pathway. Moreover, PSMA 5, NAMPT, CPT 2 and TNFSF11 had strong 
correlations with different drugs.
CONCLUSION: Three circRNAs (hsa_circ_0062682, hsa_circ_0092283 and 
hsa_circ_0070610) might be potential novel targets for the diagnosis of 
early-stage LAC.

INTRODUCTION: Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is a group of myeloproliferative 
neoplasms characterized by abnormal proliferation of platelet and 
megakaryocytes. Research on potential key genes and novel regulatory markers in 
essential thrombocythemia (ET) is still limited.
METHODS: Downloading array profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, 
we identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through comprehensive 
bioinformatic analysis. GO, and REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis was used to 
predict the potential functions of DEGs. Besides, constructing a protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network through the STRING database, we validated the 
expression level of hub genes in an independent cohort of ET, and the 
transcription factors (TFs) were detected in the regulatory networks of TFs and 
DEGs. And the candidate drugs that are targeting hub genes were identified using 
the DGIdb database.
RESULTS: We identified 63 overlap DEGs that included 21 common up-regulated and 
42 common down-regulated genes from two datasets. Functional enrichment analysis 
shows that the DEGs are mainly enriched in the immune system and inflammatory 
processes. Through PPI network analysis, ACTB, PTPRC, ACTR2, FYB, STAT1, ETS1, 
IL7R, IKZF1, FGL2, and CTSS were selected as hub genes. Interestingly, we found 
that the dysregulated hub genes are also aberrantly expressed in a bone marrow 
cohort of ET. Moreover, we found that the expression of CTSS, FGL2, IKZF1, 
STAT1, FYB, ACTR2, PTPRC, and ACTB genes were significantly under-expressed in 
ET (P<0.05), which is consistent with our bioinformatics analysis. The ROC curve 
analysis also shows that these hub genes have good diagnostic value. Besides, we 
identified 4 TFs (SPI1, IRF4, SRF, and AR) as master transcriptional regulators 
that were associated with regulating the DEGs in ET. Cyclophosphamide, 
prednisone, fluorouracil, ruxolitinib, and lenalidomide were predicted as 
potential candidate drugs for the treatment of ET.
DISCUSSION: These dysregulated genes and predicted key regulators had a 
significant relationship with the occurrence of ET with affecting the immune 
system and inflammation of the processes. Some of the immunomodulatory drugs 
have potential value by targeting ACTB, PTPRC, IL7R, and IKZF1 genes in the 
treatment of ET.

The integration of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and phenotypic traits 
across genetically diverse populations is a powerful approach to discover novel 
biological regulators. The increasing volume of complex data require new and 
easy-to-use tools accessible to a variety of scientists for the discovery and 
visualization of functionally relevant associations. To meet this requirement, 
we developed CoffeeProt, an open-source tool that analyses genetic variants 
associated to protein networks, other omics datatypes and phenotypic traits. 
CoffeeProt uses transcriptomics or proteomics data to perform correlation 
network analyses and annotates results with protein-protein interactions, 
subcellular localisations and drug associations. It then integrates genetic 
variants associated with gene expression (eQTLs) or protein abundance (pQTLs) 
and includes predictions of the potential consequences of variants on gene 
function. Finally, genetic variants are co-mapped to molecular or phenotypic 
traits either provided by the user or retrieved directly from publicly available 
GWAS results. We demonstrate its utility with the analysis of mouse and human 
population data enabling the rapid identification of genetic variants associated 
with druggable proteins and clinical traits. We expect that CoffeeProt will 
serve the systems genetics and basic science research communities, leading to 
the discovery of novel biologically relevant associations. CoffeeProt is 
available at www.coffeeprot.com.

BACKGROUND: Overexpression of miR-21 is a characteristic feature of patients 
with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and is involved in gene regulation and the 
expression enhancement of pro-inflammatory factors including IFNγ and TNF-α 
following stimulation of T-cells via the T Cell Receptor (TCR). In this study, a 
novel integrated bioinformatics analysis was used to obtain a better 
understanding of the involvement of miR-21 in the development of MS, its protein 
biomarker signatures, RNA levels, and drug interactions through existing 
microarray and RNA-seq datasets of MS.
METHODS: In order to obtain data on the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in 
patients with MS and normal controls, the GEO2R web tool was used to analyze the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, and then Protein-Protein Interaction 
(PPI) networks of co-expressed DEGs were designed using STRING. A molecular 
network of miRNA-genes and drugs based on differentially expressed genes was 
created for T-cells of MS patients to identify the targets of miR-21, that may 
act as important regulators and potential biomarkers for early diagnosis, 
prognosis and, potential therapeutic targets for MS.
RESULTS: It found that seven genes (NRIP1, ARNT, KDM7A, S100A10, AK2, TGFβR2, 
and IL-6R) are regulated by drugs used in MS and miR-21. Finally, three 
overlapping genes (S100A10, NRIP1, KDM7A) were identified between 
miRNA-gene-drug network and nineteen genes as hub genes which can reflect the 
pathophysiology of MS.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that miR-21 and MS-related drugs can act 
synergistically to regulate several genes in the existing datasets, and miR-21 
inhibitors have the potential to be used in MS treatment.

Aim: SARS-CoV-2, an emerging betacoronavirus, is the causative agent of 
COVID-19. Currently, there are few specific and selective antiviral drugs for 
the treatment and vaccines to prevent contagion. However, their long-term 
effects can be revealed after several years, and new drugs for COVID-19 should 
continue to be investigated. Materials & methods: In the first step of our study 
we identified, through a gene expression analysis, several drugs that could act 
on the biological pathways altered in COVID-19. In the second step, we performed 
a docking simulation to test the properties of the identified drugs to target 
SARS-CoV-2. Results: The drugs that showed a higher binding affinity are 
bardoxolone (-8.78 kcal/mol), irinotecan (-8.40 kcal/mol) and pyrotinib 
(-8.40 kcal/mol). Conclusion: We suggested some drugs that could be efficient in 
treating COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is one of the rarest lethal oncologic diseases that 
have hardly any specific biomarkers. The availability of high-throughput genomic 
data and advancement in bioinformatics tools allow us to predict gene biomarkers 
and apply systems biology approaches to get better diagnosis, and prognosis of 
the disease with a tentative drug that may be repurposed.
OBJECTIVE: To perform genome-wide association studies using microarray gene 
expression of ovarian cancer and identify gene biomarkers, construction and 
analyze networks, perform survival analysis, and drug interaction studies for 
better diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of ovarian cancer.
METHOD: The gene expression profiles of both healthy and serous ovarian cancer 
epithelial samples were considered. We applied a series of bioinformatics 
methods and tools, including fold-change statistics for differential expression 
analysis, DisGeNET and NCBI-Gene databases for gene-disease association mapping, 
DAVID 6.8 for GO enrichment analysis, GeneMANIA for network construction, 
Cytoscape 3.8 with its plugins for network visualization, analysis, and module 
detection, the UALCAN for patient survival analysis, and PubChem, DrugBank and 
DGIdb for gene-drug interaction.
RESULTS: We identified 8 seed genes that were subjected for drug-gene 
interaction studies. Because of over-expression in all the four stages of 
ovarian cancer, we discern that genes HMGA1 and PSAT1 are potential therapeutic 
biomarkers for its diagnosis at an early stage (stage I). Our analysis suggests 
that there are 11 drugs common in the seed genes. However, hypermethylated seed 
genes HMGA1 and PSAT1 showcased a good interaction affinity with drugs 
cisplatin, cyclosporin, bisphenol A, progesterone, and sunitinib, and are 
crucial in the proliferation of ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that HMGA1 and PSAT1 can be deployed for initial 
screening of ovarian cancer and drugs cisplatin, bisphenol A, cyclosporin, 
progesterone, and sunitinib are effective in curbing the epigenetic alteration.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 relies on cellular RNA-binding proteins 
(RBPs) to replicate and spread, although which RBPs control its life cycle 
remains largely unknown. Here, we employ a multi-omic approach to identify 
systematically and comprehensively the cellular and viral RBPs that are involved 
in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection profoundly remodels 
the cellular RNA-bound proteome, which includes wide-ranging effects on RNA 
metabolic pathways, non-canonical RBPs, and antiviral factors. Moreover, we 
apply a new method to identify the proteins that directly interact with viral 
RNA, uncovering dozens of cellular RBPs and six viral proteins. Among them are 
several components of the tRNA ligase complex, which we show regulate SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Furthermore, we discover that available drugs targeting host RBPs 
that interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA inhibit infection. Collectively, our results 
uncover a new universe of host-virus interactions with potential for new 
antiviral therapies against COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Liver cancer is one of the most common cancers and causes of cancer 
death worldwide. The objective was to elucidate novel hub genes which were 
benefit for diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy in liver cancer via 
integrated analysis.
METHODS: GSE84402, GSE101685, and GSE112791 were filtered from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified 
by using the GEO2R. The GO and KEGG pathway of DEGs were analyzed in the DAVID. 
PPI and TF network of the DEGs were constructed by using the STRING, TRANSFAC, 
and Harmonizome. The relationship between hub genes and prognoses in liver 
cancer was analyzed in UALCAN based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The 
diagnostic value of hub genes was evaluated by ROC. The relationship between hub 
genes and tumor-infiltrate lymphocytes was analyzed in TIMER. The protein levels 
of hub genes were verified in HPA. The interaction between the hub genes and the 
drug were identified in DGIdb.
RESULTS: In total, 108 upregulated and 60 downregulated DEGs were enriched in 
148 GO terms and 20 KEGG pathways. The mRNA levels and protein levels of CDK1, 
HMMR, PTTG1, and TTK were higher in liver cancer tissues compared to normal 
tissues, which showed excellent diagnostic and prognostic value. CDK1, HMMR, 
PTTG1, and TTK were positively correlated with tumor-infiltrate lymphocytes, 
which might involve tumor immune response. The CDK1, HMMR, and TTK had close

CONCLUSIONS: The CDK1, HMMR, PTTG1, and TTK were hub genes in liver cancer; 
hence, they might be potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted 
therapy of liver cancer.

Several studies have reported association between leukocyte telomere length 
(LTL) and neuropsychiatric disorders. Although telomere length is affected by 
environmental factors, genetic variants in certain loci are strongly associated 
with LTL. Thus, we aimed to identify the genomic relationship between genetic 
variants of LTL with brain-based regulatory changes and brain volume. We tested 
genetic colocalization of seven and nine LTL loci in two ancestry groups, 
European (EUR) and East-Asian (EAS), respectively, with brain morphology 
measures for 101 T1-magnetic resonance imaging-based region of interests 
(n = 21 821). The posterior probability (>90%) was observed for 'fourth 
ventricle', 'gray matter' and 'cerebellar vermal lobules I-IV' volumes. We then 
tested causal relationship using LTL loci for gene and methylation expression. 
We found causal pleiotropy for gene (EAS = four genes; EUR = five genes) and 
methylation expression (EUR = 17 probes; EAS = 4 probes) of brain tissues 
(P ≤ 2.47 × 10-6). Integrating chromatin profiles with LTL-single nucleotide 
polymorphisms identified 45 genes (EUR) and 79 genes (EAS) (P ≤ 9.78×10-7). We 
found additional 38 LTL-genes using chromatin-based gene mapping for EUR 
ancestry population. Gene variants in three LTL-genes-GPR37, OBFC1 and 
RTEL1/RTEL1-TNFRSF6B-show convergent evidence of pleiotropy with brain 
morphology, gene and methylation expression and chromatin association. Mapping 
gene functions to drug-gene interactions, we identified process 'transmission 
across chemical synapses' (P < 2.78 × 10-4). This study provides evidence that 
genetic variants of LTL have pleiotropic roles with brain-based effects that 
could explain the phenotypic association of LTL with several neuropsychiatric 
traits.

Brain tumors are among the most lethal tumors. Glioblastoma, the most frequent 
primary brain tumor in adults, has a median survival time of approximately 15 
months after diagnosis or a five-year survival rate of 10%; the recurrence rate 
is nearly 90%. Unfortunately, this prognosis has not improved for several 
decades. The lack of progress in the treatment of brain tumors has been 
attributed to their high rate of primary therapy resistance. Challenges such as 
pronounced inter-patient variability, intratumoral heterogeneity, and drug 
delivery across the blood-brain barrier hinder progress. A comprehensive, 
multiscale understanding of the disease, from the molecular to the whole tumor 
level, is needed to address the intratumor heterogeneity resulting from the 
coexistence of a diversity of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types in the 
tumor tissue. By contrast, inter-patient variability must be addressed by 
subtyping brain tumors to stratify patients and identify the best-matched 
drug(s) and therapies for a particular patient or cohort of patients. 
Accomplishing these diverse tasks will require a new framework, one involving a 
systems perspective in assessing the immense complexity of brain tumors. This 
would in turn entail a shift in how clinical medicine interfaces with the 
rapidly advancing high-throughput (HTP) technologies that have enabled the 
omics-scale profiling of molecular features of brain tumors from the single-cell 
to the tissue level. However, several gaps must be closed before such a 
framework can fulfill the promise of precision and personalized medicine for 
brain tumors. Ultimately, the goal is to integrate seamlessly multiscale systems 
analyses of patient tumors and clinical medicine. Accomplishing this goal would 
facilitate the rational design of therapeutic strategies matched to the 
characteristics of patients and their tumors. Here, we discuss some of the 
technologies, methodologies, and computational tools that will facilitate the 
realization of this vision to practice.

Epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with genes involved in Posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD often co-occurs with other health conditions such 
as depression, cardiovascular disorder and respiratory illnesses. PTSD and 
migraine have previously been reported to be symptomatically positively 
correlated with each other, but little is known about the genes involved. The 
aim of this study was to understand the comorbidity between PTSD and migraine 
using a monozygotic twin disease discordant study design in six pairs of 
monozygotic twins discordant for PTSD and 15 pairs of monozygotic twins 
discordant for migraine. DNA from peripheral blood was run on Illumina EPIC 
arrays and analyzed. Multiple testing correction was performed using the 
Bonferroni method and 10% false discovery rate (FDR). We validated 11 candidate 
genes previously associated with PTSD including DOCK2, DICER1, and ADCYAP1. In 
the epigenome-wide scan, seven novel CpGs were significantly associated with 
PTSD within/near IL37, WNT3, ADNP2, HTT, SLFN11, and NQO2, with all CpGs except 
the IL37 CpG hypermethylated in PTSD. These results were significantly enriched 
for genes whose DNA methylation was previously associated with migraine (p-value 
= 0.036). At 10% FDR, 132 CpGs in 99 genes associated with PTSD were also 
associated with migraine in the migraine twin samples. Genes associated with 
PTSD were overrepresented in vascular smooth muscle, axon guidance and oxytocin 
signaling pathways, while genes associated with both PTSD and migraine were 
enriched for AMPK signaling and longevity regulating pathways. In conclusion, 
these results suggest that common genes and pathways are likely involved in PTSD 
and migraine, explaining at least in part the co-morbidity between the two 
disorders.

The identification of genomic alterations in tumor tissues, including somatic 
mutations, deletions, and gene amplifications, produces large amounts of data, 
which can be correlated with a diversity of therapeutic responses. We aimed to 
provide a methodological framework to discover pharmacogenomic interactions 
based on Random Forests. We matched two databases from the Cancer Cell Line 
Encyclopaedia (CCLE) project, and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer 
(GDSC) project. For a total of 648 shared cell lines, we considered 48,270 gene 
alterations from CCLE as input features and the area under the dose-response 
curve (AUC) for 265 drugs from GDSC as the outcomes. A three-step reduction to 
501 alterations was performed, selecting known driver genes and excluding very 
frequent/infrequent alterations and redundant ones. For each model, we used the 
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) for assessing the predictive 
performance, and permutation importance for assessing the contribution of each 
alteration. In a reasonable computational time (56 min), we identified 12 
compounds whose response was at least fairly sensitive (CCC > 20) to the 
alteration profiles. Some diversities were found in the sets of influential 
alterations, providing clues to discover significant drug-gene interactions. The 
proposed methodological framework can be helpful for mining pharmacogenomic 
interactions.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of heterogeneous hematological 
malignancies. We identified key genes as ITGAM and lncRNA ITGB2-AS1 through 
different bioinformatics tools. Furthermore, qPCR was performed to verify the 
expression level of essential genes in clinical samples. Retrospective research 
on 179 AML cases was used to investigate the relationship between the expression 
of ITGAM and the characteristics of AML. The critical gene relationship with 
immune infiltration in AML was estimated. The clinical validation and prognostic 
investigation showed that ITGAM, PPBP, and ITGB2-AS1 are highly expressed in AML 
(P < 0.001) and significantly associated with the overall survival in AML. 
Moreover, the retrospective research on 179 clinical cases showed that positive 
expression of ITGAM is substantially related to AML classification (P < 0.001), 
higher count of white blood cells (P < 0.01), and poor chemotherapy outcome (P < 
0.05). Furthermore, based on grouping ITGAM as the high and low expression in 
TCGA-LAML profile, we found that genes in the highly expressed ITGAM group are 
mainly involved in immune infiltration and inflammation-related signaling 
pathways. Finally, we discovered that the expression level of ITGAM and lncRNA 
ITGB2-AS1 are not just closely related to the immune score and stromal score (P 
< 0.001) but also significantly positively correlated with various Immune 
signatures in AML (P < 0.001), indicating the association of these genes with 
immunosuppression in AML. The prediction of candidate drugs indicated that 
certain immunosuppressive drugs have potential therapeutic effects for AML. The 
critical genes could be used as potential biomarkers to evaluate the survival 
and prognosis of AML.

Regulatory pathways involving non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs 
(miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), have gained great relevance due to 
their role in the control of gene expression modulation. Using RNA sequencing of 
KSHV Bac36 transfected mouse endothelial cells (mECK36) and tumors, we have 
analyzed the host and viral transcriptome to uncover the role lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA 
driven networks in KSHV tumorigenesis. The integration of the differentially 
expressed ncRNAs, with an exhaustive computational analysis of their 
experimentally supported targets, led us to dissect complex networks integrated 
by the cancer-related lncRNAs Malat1, Neat1, H19, Meg3, and their associated 
miRNA-target pairs. These networks would modulate pathways related to KSHV 
pathogenesis, such as viral carcinogenesis, p53 signaling, RNA surveillance, and 
cell cycle control. Finally, the ncRNA-mRNA analysis allowed us to develop 
signatures that can be used to an appropriate identification of druggable gene 
or networks defining relevant AIDS-KS therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a rapidly growing public health problem, and 
its two main etiological types are non-ischemic heart failure (NIHF) and 
ischemic heart failure (IHF). However, the independent and common mechanisms of 
NIHF and IHF have not been fully elucidated. Here, bioinformatic analysis was 
used to characterize the difference and independent pathways for IHF and NIHF, 
and more importantly, to unearth the common potential markers and therapeutic 
targets in IHF and NIHF.
METHODS: Two data sets with accession numbers GSE26887 and GSE84796 were 
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying 
the independent and communal DEGs of NIHF and IHF, a functional annotation, 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, co-expression and drug-gene 
interaction prediction analysis, and mRNA-miRNA regulatory network analysis were 
performed for DEGs.
RESULTS: We found 1146 independent DEGs (DEGs2) of NIHF mainly enriched in 
transcription-related and 2595 independent DEGs (DEGs3) of IHF mainly enriched 
in immune-related. Moreover, 185 communal DEGs (DEGs1) were found between NIHF 
and IHF, including 93 upregulated genes and 92 downregulated genes. Pathway 
enrichment analysis results showed that GPCR pathways and biological processes 
are closely related to the occurrence of HF. In addition, three hub genes were 
identified from PPI network, including CCL5, C5 and TLR3.
CONCLUSION: The identification of DEGs and hub genes in this study contributes 
to a novel perception for potential functional mechanisms and biomarkers or 
therapeutic targets in NIHF and IHF.

Chemosensitivity assays are commonly used for preclinical drug discovery and 
clinical trial optimization. However, data from independent assays are often 
discordant, largely attributed to uncharacterized variation in the experimental 
materials and protocols. We report here the launching of MICHA (Minimal 
Information for Chemosensitivity Assays), accessed via 
https://micha-protocol.org. Distinguished from existing efforts that are often 
lacking support from data integration tools, MICHA can automatically extract 
publicly available information to facilitate the assay annotation including: 1) 
compounds, 2) samples, 3) reagents, and 4) data processing methods. For example, 
MICHA provides an integrative web server and database to obtain compound 
annotation including chemical structures, targets, and disease indications. In 
addition, the annotation of cell line samples, assay protocols and literature 
references can be greatly eased by retrieving manually curated catalogues. Once 
the annotation is complete, MICHA can export a report that conforms to the FAIR 
principle (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) of drug screening 
studies. To consolidate the utility of MICHA, we provide FAIRified protocols 
from five major cancer drug screening studies, as well as six recently conducted 
COVID-19 studies. With the MICHA webserver and database, we envisage a wider 
adoption of a community-driven effort to improve the open access of drug 
sensitivity assays.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of tibolone 
treatment in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: The gene set enrichment profile, GSE12446, which includes 9 human 
endometrial samples from postmenopausal women treated with tibolone (tibolone 
group) and 9 control samples (control group), was downloaded from GEO database 
for analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tibolone vs. control 
groups were identified and then used for function and pathway enrichment 
analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analyses were 
also performed. Finally, drug-target interaction was predicted for genes in 
modules, and then were validated in Pubmed.
RESULTS: A total of 238 up-regulated DEGs and 72 down-regulated DEGs were 
identified. These DEGs were mainly enriched in various biological processed and 
pathways, such as cilium movement (e.g., CCDC114 and DNAI2), calcium ion 
homeostasis, regulation of hormone levels and complement/coagulation cascades. 
PPI network contained 368 interactions and 166 genes, of which IGF1, DNALI1, 
CCDC114, TOP2A, DNAH5 and DNAI2 were the hue genes. A total of 96 drug-gene 
interactions were obtained, including 94 drugs and eight genes. TOP2A and HTR2B 
were found to be targets of 28 drugs and 38 drugs, respectively. Among the 94 
obtained drugs, only 12 drugs were reported in studies, of which 7 drugs (e.g., 
epirubicin) were found to target TOP2A.
CONCLUSIONS: CCDC114 and DNAI2 might play important roles in tibolone-treated 
postmenopausal women via cilium movement function. TOP2A might be a crucial 
target of tibolone in endometrium of postmenopausal women.

To identify candidate causal genes of asthma, we performed a genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) in UK Biobank on a broad asthma definition (n = 56,167 
asthma cases and 352,255 controls). We then carried out functional mapping 
through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and Mendelian 
randomization in lung (n = 1,038) and blood (n = 31,684) tissues. The GWAS 
reveals 72 asthma-associated loci from 116 independent significant variants 
(PGWAS < 5.0E-8). The most significant lung TWAS gene on 17q12-q21 is GSDMB 
(PTWAS = 1.42E-54). Other TWAS genes include TSLP on 5q22, RERE on 1p36, CLEC16A 
on 16p13, and IL4R on 16p12, which all replicated in GTEx lung (n = 515). We 
demonstrate that the largest fold enrichment of regulatory and functional 
annotations among asthma-associated variants is in the blood. We map 485 blood 
eQTL-regulated genes associated with asthma and 50 of them are causal by 
Mendelian randomization. Prioritization of druggable genes reveals known (IL4R, 
TSLP, IL6, TNFSF4) and potentially new therapeutic targets for asthma.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the most common female cancers in 
many developing and underdeveloped countries. High incidence, late presentation, 
and mortality suggested the need for molecular markers. Mitochondrial defects 
due to abnormal expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (NEMG) have 
been reported during cancer progression. Nevertheless, the application of NEMG 
for the prognosis of CC is still elusive. Herein, we aimed to investigate the 
associations between NEMG and CC prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the TCGA-CESC 
dataset and NEMGs were retrieved from TACCO and Mitocarta2.0 databases, 
respectively. The impact of methylation on NEMG expression were predicted using 
DNMIVD and UALCAN tools. HCMDB tool was used to predict genes having metastatic 
potential. The prognostic models were constructed using DNMIVD, TACCO, GEPIA2, 
and SurvExpress. The functional enrichment analysis (FEA) was performed using 
clusterProfiler. The protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) was constructed 
to identify the hub genes (HG) using String and CytoHubba tools. Independent 
validation of the HG was performed using Oncomine and Human Protein Atlas 
databases. The druggable genes were predicted using DGIdb.
RESULTS: Among the 52 differentially expressed NEMG, 15 were regulated by DNA 
methylation. The expression level of 16, 10, and 7 has the potential for CC 
staging, prediction of metastasis, and prognosis. Moreover, 1 driver gene and 16 
druggable genes were also identified. The FEA identified the enrichment of 
cancer-related pathways, including AMPK and carbon metabolism in cancer. The 
combined expression of 10 HG has been shown to affect patient survival.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the abnormal expression of NEMGs may play 
a critical role in CC development and progression. The genes identified in our 
study may serve as a prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in CC.<br />.

Bipolar disorder is a heritable mental illness with complex etiology. We 
performed a genome-wide association study of 41,917 bipolar disorder cases and 
371,549 controls of European ancestry, which identified 64 associated genomic 
loci. Bipolar disorder risk alleles were enriched in genes in synaptic signaling 
pathways and brain-expressed genes, particularly those with high specificity of 
expression in neurons of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Significant 
signal enrichment was found in genes encoding targets of antipsychotics, calcium 
channel blockers, antiepileptics and anesthetics. Integrating expression 
quantitative trait locus data implicated 15 genes robustly linked to bipolar 
disorder via gene expression, encoding druggable targets such as HTR6, MCHR1, 
DCLK3 and FURIN. Analyses of bipolar disorder subtypes indicated high but 
imperfect genetic correlation between bipolar disorder type I and II and 
identified additional associated loci. Together, these results advance our 
understanding of the biological etiology of bipolar disorder, identify novel 
therapeutic leads and prioritize genes for functional follow-up studies.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common cancer of the oral cavity in 
India. Cigarette smoking and chewing tobacco are known risk factors associated 
with OSCC. However, genomic alterations in OSCC with varied tobacco consumption 
history are not well-characterized. In this study, we carried out whole-exome 
sequencing to characterize the mutational landscape of OSCC tumors from subjects 
with different tobacco consumption habits. We identified several frequently 
mutated genes, including TP53, NOTCH1, CASP8, RYR2, LRP2, CDKN2A, and ATM. TP53 
and HRAS exhibited mutually exclusive mutation patterns. We identified recurrent 
amplifications in the 1q31, 7q35, 14q11, 22q11, and 22q13 regions and observed 
amplification of EGFR in 25% of samples with tobacco consumption history. We 
observed genomic alterations in several genes associated with PTK6 signaling. We 
observed alterations in clinically actionable targets including ERBB4, HRAS, 
EGFR, NOTCH1, NOTCH4, and NOTCH3. We observed enrichment of signature 29 in 40% 
of OSCC samples from tobacco chewers. Signature 15 associated with defective DNA 
mismatch repair was enriched in 80% of OSCC samples. NOTCH1 was mutated in 36% 
of samples and harbored truncating as well as missense variants. We observed 
copy number alterations in 67% of OSCC samples. Several genes associated with 
non-receptor tyrosine kinase signaling were affected in OSCC. These molecules 
can serve as potential candidates for therapeutic targeting in OSCC.

The design of CRISPR gRNAs requires accurate on-target efficiency predictions, 
which demand high-quality gRNA activity data and efficient modeling. To advance, 
we here report on the generation of on-target gRNA activity data for 10,592 
SpCas9 gRNAs. Integrating these with complementary published data, we train a 
deep learning model, CRISPRon, on 23,902 gRNAs. Compared to existing tools, 
CRISPRon exhibits significantly higher prediction performances on four test 
datasets not overlapping with training data used for the development of these 
tools. Furthermore, we present an interactive gRNA design webserver based on the 
CRISPRon standalone software, both available via 
https://rth.dk/resources/crispr/ . CRISPRon advances CRISPR applications by 
providing more accurate gRNA efficiency predictions than the existing tools.

OBJECTIVE: Development and progression of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases 
(IMIDs) involve intricate dysregulation of the disease-associated genes (DAGs) 
and their expressing immune cells. Identifying the crucial disease-associated 
cells (DACs) in IMIDs has been challenging due to the underlying complex 
molecular mechanism.
METHODS: Using transcriptome profiles of 40 different immune cells, unsupervised 
machine learning, and disease-gene networks, we constructed the Disease-gene 
IMmune cell Expression (DIME) network and identified top DACs and DAGs of 12 
phenotypically different IMIDs. We compared the DIME networks of IMIDs to 
identify common pathways between them. We used the common pathways and publicly 
available drug-gene network to identify promising drug repurposing targets.
RESULTS: We found CD4+Treg, CD4+Th1, and NK cells as top DACs in inflammatory 
arthritis such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, and 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA); neutrophils, granulocytes, and BDCA1+CD14+ cells in 
systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic scleroderma; ILC2, CD4+Th1, CD4+Treg, 
and NK cells in the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We identified lymphoid 
cells (CD4+Th1, CD4+Treg, and NK) and their associated pathways to be important 
in HLA-B27 type diseases (psoriasis, AS, and IBDs) and in 
primary-joint-inflammation-based inflammatory arthritis (AS and RA). Based on 
the common cellular mechanisms, we identified lifitegrast as a potential drug 
repurposing candidate for Crohn's disease and other IMIDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing methods are inadequate in capturing the intricate 
involvement of the crucial genes and cell types essential to IMIDs. Our approach 
identified the key DACs, DAGs, common mechanisms between IMIDs, and proposed 
potential drug repurposing targets using the DIME network. To extend our method 
to other diseases, we built the DIME tool 
(https://bitbucket.org/systemsimmunology/dime/) to help scientists uncover the 
etiology of complex and rare diseases to further drug development by 
better-determining drug targets, thereby mitigating the risk of failure in late 
clinical development.

patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The ESTIMATE 
scoring algorithm was used to calculate immune and stromal scores. The 
application of these scores in histology classification was tested. Univariate 
Cox regression analysis was conducted to identify genes with prognostic value. 
Subsequently, functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network analysis were performed to reveal the pathways and biological 
functions associated with the genes. Next, these prognosis genes were validated 
in an independent GBM cohort from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). 
Finally, the efficacy of current antitumor drugs targeting these genes against 
glioma was evaluated. Results: Gene expression profiles and clinical data of 309 
GBM samples were obtained from TCGA database. Higher immune and stromal scores 
were found to be significantly correlated with tissue type and poor overall 
survival (OS) (p = 0.15 and 0.77, respectively). Functional enrichment analysis 
identified 860 upregulated and 162 downregulated cross genes, which were mainly 
linked to immune response, inflammatory response, cell membrane, and receptor 
activity. Survival analysis identified 228 differentially expressed genes 
associated with the prognosis of GBM (p ≤ 0.05). A total of 48 hub genes were 
identified by the Cytoscape tool, and pathway enrichment analysis of the genes 
was performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated 
Discovery (DAVID). The 228 genes were validated in an independent GBM cohort 
from the CGGA. In total, 10 genes were found to be significantly associated with 
prognosis of GBM. Finally, 14 antitumor drugs were identified by drug-gene 
interaction analysis. Conclusions: Here, 10 TME-related genes and 14 
corresponding antitumor agents were found to be associated with the prognosis 
and OS of GBM.

Immunotherapy that block PD-1-PD-L1 pathway can induce durable tumor control and 
result in the long-term survival of patients with advanced bladder cancers. 
However, these responses only occur in a subset of patients. We study gene 
expression profiles in 1763 muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs) and 11,835 
solid tumors from TCGA. We establish an immune-based classification on the basis 
of the composition of the tumor microenvironment and identify six distinct 
phenotypes. The class F was characterized by a strong tertiary lymphoid 
structures (TLSs) related gene expression signature. Pan-cancer gene expression 
analysis of tertiary lymphoid structure markers in 11,835 solid tumors from TCGA 
unveiled the heterogeneity of TLSs abundance both within and between human 
cancer types. The class F group demonstrated improved survival and a high 
response rate to PD1 blockade. This work confirms the immune subtypes in 
patients with MIBC, and unravels the potential of TLS signatures to guide 
clinical decision-making and treatments.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent aortic disease that causes high 
mortality due to asymptomatic gradual expansion and sudden rupture. The 
underlying molecular mechanisms and effective pharmaceutical therapy for 
preventing AAA progression have not been fully identified. In this study, we 
identified the key modules and hub genes involved in AAA growth from the 
GSE17901 dataset in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database through the 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Key genes were further 
selected and validated in the mouse dataset (GSE12591) and human datasets 
(GSE7084, GSE47472, and GSE57691). Finally, we predicted drug candidates 
targeting key genes using the Drug-Gene Interaction database. Overall, we 
identified key modules enriched in the mitotic cell cycle, GTPase activity, and 
several metabolic processes. Seven key genes (CCR5, ADCY5, ADCY3, ACACB, LPIN1, 
ACSL1, UCP3) related to AAA progression were identified. A total of 35 
drugs/compounds targeting the key genes were predicted, which may have the 
potential to prevent AAA progression.

Advances in cancer genomics have revealed genomic classes of acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) characterized by class-defining mutations, such as chimeric 
fusion genes or in genes such as NPM1, MLL, and CEBPA. These class-defining 
mutations frequently synergize with internal tandem duplications in FLT3 
(FLT3-ITDs) to drive leukemogenesis. However, ∼20% of FLT3-ITD-positive AMLs 
bare no class-defining mutations, and mechanisms of leukemic transformation in 
these cases are unknown. To identify pathways that drive FLT3-ITD mutant AML in 
the absence of class-defining mutations, we performed an insertional mutagenesis 
(IM) screening in Flt3-ITD mice, using Sleeping Beauty transposons. All mice 
developed acute leukemia (predominantly AML) after a median of 73 days. Analysis 
of transposon insertions in 38 samples from Flt3-ITD/IM leukemic mice identified 
recurrent integrations at 22 loci, including Setbp1 (20/38), Ets1 (11/38), Ash1l 
(8/38), Notch1 (8/38), Erg (7/38), and Runx1 (5/38). Insertions at Setbp1 led 
exclusively to AML and activated a transcriptional program similar, but not 
identical, to those of NPM1-mutant and MLL-rearranged AMLs. Guide RNA targeting 
of Setbp1 was highly detrimental to Flt3ITD/+/Setbp1IM+, but not to 
Flt3ITD/+/Npm1cA/+, AMLs. Also, analysis of RNA-sequencing data from hundreds of 
human AMLs revealed that SETBP1 expression is significantly higher in FLT3-ITD 
AMLs lacking class-defining mutations. These findings propose that SETBP1 
overexpression collaborates with FLT3-ITD to drive a subtype of human AML. To 
identify genetic vulnerabilities of these AMLs, we performed genome-wide 
CRISPR-Cas9 screening in Flt3ITD/+/Setbp1IM+ AMLs and identified potential 
therapeutic targets, including Kdm1a, Brd3, Ezh2, and Hmgcr. Our study gives new 
insights into epigenetic pathways that can drive AMLs lacking class-defining 
mutations and proposes therapeutic approaches against such cases.

MOTIVATION: Causal biological interaction networks represent cellular regulatory 
pathways. Their fusion with other biological data enables insights into disease 
mechanisms and novel opportunities for drug discovery.
RESULTS: We developed Causal Network of Diseases (CaNDis), a web server for the 
exploration of a human causal interaction network, which we expanded with data 
on diseases and FDA-approved drugs, on the basis of which we constructed a 
disease-disease network in which the links represent the similarity between 
diseases. We show how CaNDis can be used to identify candidate genes with known 
and novel roles in disease co-occurrence and drug-drug interactions.

Hepatitis C virus-associated HCC (HCV-HCC) is a prevalent malignancy worldwide 
and the molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we screened 240 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of HCV-HCC from Gene expression omnibus 
(GEO) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), followed by weighted gene coexpression 
network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the most significant module correlated with 
the overall survival. 10 hub genes (CCNB1, AURKA, TOP2A, NEK2, CENPF, NUF2, 
CDKN3, PRC1, ASPM, RACGAP1) were identified by four approaches (Protein-protein 
interaction networks of the DEGs and of the significant module by WGCNA, and 
diagnostic and prognostic values), and their abnormal expressions, diagnostic 
values, and prognostic values were successfully verified. A four hub gene-based 
prognostic signature was built using the least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) algorithm and a multivariate Cox regression model with the 
ICGC-LIRI-JP cohort (N =112). Kaplan-Meier survival plots (P = 0.0003) and 
Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC = 0.778) demonstrated the 
excellent predictive potential for the prognosis of HCV-HCC. Additionally, 
upstream regulators including transcription factors and miRNAs of hub genes were 
predicted, and candidate drugs or herbs were identified. These findings provide 
a firm basis for the exploration of the molecular mechanism and further clinical 
biomarkers development of HCV-HCC.

BACKGROUND: The genetic basis of lacunar stroke is poorly understood, with a 
single locus on 16q24 identified to date. We sought to identify novel 
associations and provide mechanistic insights into the disease.
METHODS: We did a pooled analysis of data from newly recruited patients with an 
MRI-confirmed diagnosis of lacunar stroke and existing genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS). Patients were recruited from hospitals in the UK as part of the 
UK DNA Lacunar Stroke studies 1 and 2 and from collaborators within the 
International Stroke Genetics Consortium. Cases and controls were stratified by 
ancestry and two meta-analyses were done: a European ancestry analysis, and a 
transethnic analysis that included all ancestry groups. We also did a 
multi-trait analysis of GWAS, in a joint analysis with a study of cerebral white 
matter hyperintensities (an aetiologically related radiological trait), to find 
additional genetic associations. We did a transcriptome-wide association study 
(TWAS) to detect genes for which expression is associated with lacunar stroke; 
identified significantly enriched pathways using multi-marker analysis of 
genomic annotation; and evaluated cardiovascular risk factors causally 
associated with the disease using mendelian randomisation.
FINDINGS: Our meta-analysis comprised studies from Europe, the USA, and 
Australia, including 7338 cases and 254 798 controls, of which 2987 cases 
(matched with 29 540 controls) were confirmed using MRI. Five loci 
(ICA1L-WDR12-CARF-NBEAL1, ULK4, SPI1-SLC39A13-PSMC3-RAPSN, ZCCHC14, 
ZBTB14-EPB41L3) were found to be associated with lacunar stroke in the European 
or transethnic meta-analyses. A further seven loci (SLC25A44-PMF1-BGLAP, 
LOX-ZNF474-LOC100505841, FOXF2-FOXQ1, VTA1-GPR126, SH3PXD2A, HTRA1-ARMS2, 
COL4A2) were found to be associated in the multi-trait analysis with cerebral 
white matter hyperintensities (n=42 310). Two of the identified loci contain 
genes (COL4A2 and HTRA1) that are involved in monogenic lacunar stroke. The TWAS 
identified associations between the expression of six genes (SCL25A44, ULK4, 
CARF, FAM117B, ICA1L, NBEAL1) and lacunar stroke. Pathway analyses implicated 
disruption of the extracellular matrix, phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 
binding, and roundabout binding (false discovery rate <0·05). Mendelian 
randomisation analyses identified positive associations of elevated blood 
pressure, history of smoking, and type 2 diabetes with lacunar stroke.
INTERPRETATION: Lacunar stroke has a substantial heritable component, with 12 
loci now identified that could represent future treatment targets. These loci 
provide insights into lacunar stroke pathogenesis, highlighting disruption of 
the vascular extracellular matrix (COL4A2, LOX, SH3PXD2A, GPR126, HTRA1), 
pericyte differentiation (FOXF2, GPR126), TGF-β signalling (HTRA1), and 
myelination (ULK4, GPR126) in disease risk.

The strongest genetic risk factor for idiopathic late-onset Alzheimer's disease 
(LOAD) is apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4, while the APOE ɛ2 allele is protective. 
However, there are paradoxical APOE ɛ4 carriers who remain disease-free and APOE 
ɛ2 carriers with LOAD. We compared exomes of healthy APOE ɛ4 carriers and APOE 
ɛ2 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, prioritizing coding variants based on 
their predicted functional impact, and identified 216 genes with differential 
mutational load between these two populations. These candidate genes were 
significantly dysregulated in LOAD brains, and many modulated tau- or 
β42-induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila. Variants in these genes were 
associated with AD risk, even in APOE ɛ3 homozygotes, showing robust predictive 
power for risk stratification. Network analyses revealed involvement of 
candidate genes in brain cell type-specific pathways including synaptic biology, 
dendritic spine pruning and inflammation. These potential modifiers of LOAD may 
constitute novel biomarkers, provide potential therapeutic intervention avenues, 
and support applying this approach as larger whole exome sequencing cohorts 
become available.

various extrapulmonary manifestations resulting in higher mortality and these 
comorbidities are posing a challenge to the health care system. Reports indicate 
that 30-60% of patients with COVID-19 suffer from neurological symptoms. To 
understand the molecular basis of the neurologic comorbidity in COVID-19 
patients, we have investigated the genetic association between COVID-19 and 
various brain disorders through a systems biology-based network approach and 
observed a remarkable resemblance. Our results showed 123 brain-related 
disorders associated with COVID-19 and form a high-density disease-disease 
network. The brain-disease-gene network revealed five highly clustered modules 
demonstrating a greater complexity of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, we have 
identified 35 hub proteins of the network which were largely involved in the 
protein catabolic process, cell cycle, RNA metabolic process, and nuclear 
transport. Perturbing these hub proteins by drug repurposing will improve the 
clinical conditions in comorbidity. In the near future, we assumed that in 
COVID-19 patients, many other neurological manifestations will likely surface. 
Thus, understanding the infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and associated 
comorbidity is a high priority to contain its short- and long-term effects on 
human health. Our network-based analysis strengthens the understanding of the 
molecular basis of the neurological manifestations observed in COVID-19 and also 
suggests drug for repurposing.

Omics techniques generate large, multidimensional data that are amenable to 
analysis by new informatics approaches alongside conventional statistical 
methods. Systems theories, including network analysis and machine learning, are 
well placed for analysing these data but must be applied with an understanding 
of the relevant biological and computational theories. Through applying these 
techniques to omics data, systems biology addresses the problems posed by the 
complex organization of biological processes. In this Review, we describe the 
techniques and sources of omics data, outline network theory, and highlight 
exemplars of novel approaches that combine gene regulatory and co-expression 
networks, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and phenomics with informatics 
techniques to provide new insights into cardiovascular disease. The use of 
systems approaches will become necessary to integrate data from more than one 
omic technique. Although understanding the interactions between different omics 
data requires increasingly complex concepts and methods, we argue that 
hypothesis-driven investigations and independent validation must still accompany 
these novel systems biology approaches to realize their full potential.

Atherosclerotic plaque instability is a major cause of ischemic stroke. 
Researchers must develop novel strategies for the detection and treatment of 
unstable atherosclerotic plaque (UAP)-related stroke. We aimed to identify 
potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of UAP-related stroke. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of UAP, ischemic stroke and smoking were 
identified by microarray analyses from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Gene 
Ontology (GO) and pathway functional enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed 
to analyze plaque destabilization and ischemic stroke physiopathology. An 
integrative analysis of UAP, ischemic stroke and smoking DEGs and functional 
annotations was performed to identify the underlying physiopathology and hub 
genes in UAP-related stroke and the relationship with smoking. Online search 
databases were applied to confirm hub gene biofunctions and their relationships 
with atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular diseases. Following integrative 
analysis, 18 co-DEGs of UAP and ischemic stroke, including 17 upregulated and 
one downregulated, were identified. Inflammation, immunity, extracellular matrix 
degradation, blood coagulation, apoptosis and nerve degeneration were the 
primary physiopathological processes in UAP-related stroke. Hub genes included 
MMP9, ITGAM, CCR1, NCF2 and CD163, among which MMP9 and ITGAM were top 10 genes 
for both UAP and stroke. Smoking may upregulate MMP9, NCF2, C5AR1 and ANPEP to 
accelerate plaque destabilization and UAP-related stroke. MMP9, ITGAM, CCR1, 
NCF2, CD163, hsa-miR-3123 and hsa-miR-144-3p are potential diagnostic and 
prognostic biomarkers of UAP-related stroke. MMP9 and ITGAM are potential 
therapeutic targets of UAP-related stroke, which will contribute to the 
development of novel management strategies.

To date, research on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, encompassing Crohn's 
disease and ulcerative colitis), a chronic complex disorder, has generated a 
large amount of data scattered across published literature (1 06 333) listed in 
PubMed on 14 October 2020, and no dedicated database currently exists that 
catalogues information on genes associated with IBD. We aimed to manually curate 
289 genes that are experimentally validated to be linked with IBD and its known 
phenotypes. Furthermore, we have developed an integrated platform providing 
information about different aspects of these genes by incorporating several 
resources and an extensive text-mined knowledgebase. The curated IBD database 
(IBDDB) allows the selective display of collated 34 subject-specific concepts 
(listed as columns) exportable through a user-friendly IBDDB portal. The 
information embedded in concepts was acquired via text-mining of PubMed 
(manually cleaned and curated), accompanied by data-mining from varied 
resources. The user can also explore different biomedical entities and their 
co-occurrence with other entities (about one million) from 11 curated 
dictionaries in the indexed PubMed records. This functionality permits the user 
to generate and cross-examine a new hypothesis that is otherwise not easy to 
comprehend by just reading the published abstracts and papers. Users can 
download required information using various file formats and can display 
information in the form of networks. To our knowledge, no curated database of 
IBD-related genes is available so far. IBDDB is free for academic users and can 
be accessed at https://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/ibd/.

Networks are useful tools to represent and analyze interactions on a large, or 
genome-wide scale and have therefore been widely used in biology. Many 
biological networks-such as those that represent regulatory interactions, 
drug-gene, or gene-disease associations-are of a bipartite nature, meaning they 
consist of two different types of nodes, with connections only forming between 
the different node sets. Analysis of such networks requires methodologies that 
are specifically designed to handle their bipartite nature. Community structure 
detection is a method used to identify clusters of nodes in a network. This 
approach is especially helpful in large-scale biological network analysis, as it 
can find structure in networks that often resemble a "hairball" of interactions 
in visualizations. Often, the communities identified in biological networks are 
enriched for specific biological processes and thus allow one to assign drugs, 
regulatory molecules, or diseases to such processes. In addition, comparison of 
community structures between different biological conditions can help to 
identify how network rewiring may lead to tissue development or disease, for 
example. In this mini review, we give a theoretical basis of different methods 
that can be applied to detect communities in bipartite biological networks. We 
introduce and discuss different scores that can be used to assess the quality of 
these community structures. We then apply a wide range of methods to a drug-gene 
interaction network to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these methods 
in their application to large-scale, bipartite biological networks.

Multiple driver genes in individual patient samples may cause resistance to 
individual drugs in precision medicine. However, current computational methods 
have not studied how to fill the gap between personalized driver gene 
identification and combinatorial drug discovery for individual patients. Here, 
we developed a novel structural network controllability-based personalized 
driver genes and combinatorial drug identification algorithm (CPGD), aiming to 
identify combinatorial drugs for an individual patient by targeting personalized 
driver genes from network controllability perspective. On two benchmark disease 
datasets (i.e. breast cancer and lung cancer datasets), performance of CPGD is 
superior to that of other state-of-the-art driver gene-focus methods in terms of 
discovery rate among prior-known clinical efficacious combinatorial drugs. 
Especially on breast cancer dataset, CPGD evaluated synergistic effect of 
pairwise drug combinations by measuring synergistic effect of their 
corresponding personalized driver gene modules, which are affected by a given 
targeting personalized driver gene set of drugs. The results showed that CPGD 
performs better than existing synergistic combinatorial strategies in 
identifying clinical efficacious paired combinatorial drugs. Furthermore, CPGD 
enhanced cancer subtyping by computationally providing personalized side effect 
signatures for individual patients. In addition, CPGD identified 90 drug 
combinations candidates from SARS-COV2 dataset as potential drug repurposing 
candidates for recently spreading COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and degenerative joint disease, 
which causes stiffness, pain, and decreased function. At the early stage of OA, 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the first-line 
treatment. However, the efficacy and utility of available drug therapies are 
limited. We aim to use bioinformatics to identify potential genes and drugs 
associated with OA.
METHODS: The genes related to OA and NSAIDs therapy were determined by text 
mining. Then, the common genes were performed for GO, KEGG pathway analysis, and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Using the MCODE 
plugin-obtained hub genes, the expression levels of hub genes were verified 
using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The confirmed 
genes were queried in the Drug Gene Interaction Database to determine potential 
genes and drugs.
RESULTS: The qRT-PCR result showed that the expression level of 15 genes was 
significantly increased in OA samples. Finally, eight potential genes were 
targetable to a total of 53 drugs, twenty-one of which have been employed to 
treat OA and 32 drugs have not yet been used in OA.
CONCLUSIONS: The 15 genes (including PTGS2, NLRP3, MMP9, IL1RN, CCL2, TNF, IL10, 
CD40, IL6, NGF, TP53, RELA, BCL2L1, VEGFA, and NOTCH1) and 32 drugs, which have 
not been used in OA but approved by the FDA for other diseases, could be 
potential genes and drugs, respectively, to improve OA treatment. Additionally, 
those methods provided tremendous opportunities to facilitate drug repositioning 
efforts and study novel target pharmacology in the pharmaceutical industry.

BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is an essential pathological 
mechanism related to low back pain. Current research on spinal surgery focused 
on the sophisticated mechanisms involved in LDD, and autophagy was regarded as 
an essential factor in the pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVES: Our research aimed to apply a bioinformatics approach to select some 
candidate genes and signaling pathways in relationship with autophagy and LDD 
and to figure out potential agents targeting autophagy- and LDD-related genes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Text mining was used to find autophagy- and LDD-related 
genes. The DAVID program was applied in Gene Ontology and pathway analysis after 
selecting these genes. Several important gene modules were obtained by 
establishing a network of protein-protein interaction and a functional 
enrichment analysis. Finally, the selected genes were searched in the drug 
database to find the agents that target LDD- and autophagy-related genes.
RESULTS: There were 72 genes related to "autophagy" and "LDD." Three significant 
gene modules (22 genes) were selected by using gene enrichment analysis, which 
represented 4 signaling pathways targeted by 32 kinds of drugs approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The interactions between drugs and the genes 
were also identified.
CONCLUSION: To conclude, a method was proposed in our research to find candidate 
genes, pathways, and drugs which were involved in autophagy and LDD. We 
discovered 22 genes, 4 pathways, and 32 potential agents, which provided a 
theoretical basis and new direction for clinical and basic research on LDD.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive nervous system cancer. Understanding 
its molecular pathogenesis is crucial to improving diagnosis and treatment. 
Integrated analysis of genomic, proteomic, post-translational modification and 
metabolomic data on 99 treatment-naive GBMs provides insights to GBM biology. We 
identify key phosphorylation events (e.g., phosphorylated PTPN11 and PLCG1) as 
potential switches mediating oncogenic pathway activation, as well as potential 
targets for EGFR-, TP53-, and RB1-altered tumors. Immune subtypes with distinct 
immune cell types are discovered using bulk omics methodologies, validated by 
snRNA-seq, and correlated with specific expression and histone acetylation 
patterns. Histone H2B acetylation in classical-like and immune-low GBM is driven 
largely by BRDs, CREBBP, and EP300. Integrated metabolomic and proteomic data 
identify specific lipid distributions across subtypes and distinct global 
metabolic changes in IDH-mutated tumors. This work highlights biological 
relationships that could contribute to stratification of GBM patients for more 
effective treatment.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive hereditary muscular disease 
caused by a lack of dystrophin, leading to membrane instability, cell damage, 
and inflammatory response. However, gene-editing alone is not enough to restore 
the healthy phenotype and additional treatments are required. In the present 
study, we have first conducted a meta-analysis of three microarray datasets, 
GSE38417, GSE3307, and GSE6011, to identify the differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) between healthy donors and DMD patients. We have then integrated this 
analysis with the knowledge obtained from DisGeNET and DIAMOnD, a well-known 
algorithm for drug-gene association discoveries in the human interactome. The 
data obtained allowed us to identify novel possible target genes and were used 
to predict potential therapeutical options that could reverse the pathological 
condition.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third 
most common cause of cancer-related death, with tumour associated liver 
endothelial cells being thought to be major drivers in HCC progression. This 
study aims to compare the gene expression profiles of tumour endothelial cells 
from the liver with endothelial cells from non-tumour liver tissue, to identify 
perturbed biologic functions, co-expression modules, and potentially drugable 
hub genes that could give rise to novel therapeutic targets and strategies. Gene 
Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) showed that cell growth-related pathways were 
upregulated, whereas apoptosis induction, immune and inflammatory-related 
pathways were downregulated in tumour endothelial cells. Weighted Gene 
Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified several modules strongly 
associated to tumour endothelial cells or angiogenic activated endothelial cells 
with high endoglin (ENG) expression. In tumour cells, upregulated modules were 
associated with cell growth, cell proliferation, and DNA-replication, whereas 
downregulated modules were involved in immune functions, particularly complement 
activation. In ENG+ cells, upregulated modules were associated with cell 
adhesion and endothelial functions. One downregulated module was associated with 
immune system-related functions. Querying the STRING database revealed known 
functional-interaction networks underlying the modules. Several possible hub 
genes were identified, of which some (for example FEN1, BIRC5, NEK2, CDKN3, and 
TTK) are potentially druggable as determined by querying the Drug Gene 
Interaction database. In summary, our study provides a detailed picture of the 
transcriptomic differences between tumour and non-tumour endothelium in the 
liver on a co-expression network level, indicates several potential therapeutic 
targets and presents an analysis workflow that can be easily adapted to other 
projects.

Fibrotic diseases cover a spectrum of systemic and organ-specific maladies that 
affect a large portion of the population, currently without cure. The shared 
characteristic these diseases feature is their uncontrollable fibrogenesis 
deemed responsible for the accumulated damage in the susceptible tissues. 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, an interstitial lung disease, is one of the most 
common and studied fibrotic diseases and still remains an active research 
target. In this study we highlight unique and common (i) genes, (ii) biological 
pathways and (iii) candidate repurposed drugs among 9 fibrotic diseases. We 
identify 7 biological pathways involved in all 9 fibrotic diseases as well as 
pathways unique to some of these diseases. Based on our Drug Repurposing 
results, we suggest captopril and ibuprofen that both appear to slow the 
progression of fibrotic diseases according to existing bibliography. We also 
recommend nafcillin and memantine, which haven't been studied against fibrosis 
yet, for further wet-lab experimentation. We also observe a group of 
cardiomyopathy-related pathways that are exclusively highlighted for Oral 
Submucous Fibrosis. We suggest digoxin to be tested against Oral Submucous 
Fibrosis, since we observe cardiomyopathy-related pathways implicated in Oral 
Submucous Fibrosis and there is bibliographic evidence that digoxin may 
potentially clear myocardial fibrosis. Finally, we establish that Idiopathic 
Pulmonary Fibrosis shares several involved genes, biological pathways and 
candidate inhibiting-drugs with Dupuytren's Disease, IgG4-related Disease, 
Systemic Sclerosis and Cystic Fibrosis. We propose that treatments for these 
fibrotic diseases should be jointly pursued.

Diabetes mellitus is a complex and heterogeneous metabolic disorder which is 
often pre- or post-existent with complications such as cardiovascular disease, 
hypertension, inflammation, chronic kidney disease, diabetic retino- and 
nephropathies. However, the frequencies of these co-morbidities vary among 
individuals and across populations. It is, therefore, not unlikely that certain 
genetic variants might commonly contribute to these conditions. Here, we 
identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs5186, rs1800795, rs1799983 
and rs1800629 in AGTR1, IL6, NOS3 and TNFA genes, respectively) to be commonly 
associated with each of these conditions. We explored their possible interplay 
in diabetes and associated complications. The variant allele and haplotype 
frequencies at these polymorphic loci vary among different super-populations 
(African, European, admixed Americans, South and East Asians). The variant 
alleles are particularly highly prevalent in different European and admixed 
American populations. Differential distribution of these variants in different 
ethnic groups suggests that certain drugs might be more effective in selective 
populations rather than all. Therefore, population specific genetic 
architectures should be considered before considering a drug for these 
conditions.

Since its emergence in March 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has produced 
more than 116 million cases and 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Despite the 
enormous efforts carried out by the scientific community, no effective 
treatments have been developed to date. We applied a novel computational 
pipeline aimed to accelerate the process of identifying drug repurposing 
candidates which allows us to compare three-dimensional protein structures. Its 
use in conjunction with two in silico validation strategies (molecular docking 
and transcriptomic analyses) allowed us to identify a set of potential drug 
repurposing candidates targeting three viral proteins (3CL viral protease, NSP15 
endoribonuclease, and NSP12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), which included rutin, 
dexamethasone, and vemurafenib. This is the first time that a topological data 
analysis (TDA)-based strategy has been used to compare a massive number of 
protein structures with the final objective of performing drug repurposing to 
treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Age is a common risk factor in many diseases, but the molecular basis for this 
relationship is elusive. In this study we identified 4 disease clusters from 116 
diseases in the UK Biobank data, defined by their age-of-onset profiles, and 
found that diseases with the same onset profile are genetically more similar, 
suggesting a common etiology. This similarity was not explained by disease 
categories, co-occurrences or disease cause-effect relationships. Two of the 
four disease clusters had an increased risk of occurrence from age 20 and 40 
years respectively. They both showed an association with known aging-related 
genes, yet differed in functional enrichment and evolutionary profiles. 
Moreover, they both had age-related expression and methylation changes. We also 
tested mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy theories of aging and 
found support for both.

BACKGROUND: Therapeutic resistance is the main cause of death in metastatic 
colorectal cancer. To investigate genomic plasticity, most specifically of 
metastatic lesions, associated with response to first-line systemic therapy, we 
collected longitudinal liver metastatic samples and characterized the copy 
number aberration (CNA) landscape and its effect on the transcriptome.
METHODS: Liver metastatic biopsies were collected prior to treatment (pre, 
n = 97) and when clinical imaging demonstrated therapeutic resistance (post, 
n = 43). CNAs were inferred from whole exome sequencing and were correlated with 
both the status of the lesion and overall patient progression-free survival 
(PFS). We used RNA sequencing data from the same sample set to validate 
aberrations as well as independent datasets to prioritize candidate genes.
RESULTS: We identified a significantly increased frequency gain of a unique CN, 
in liver metastatic lesions after first-line treatment, on chr18p11.32 harboring 
10 genes, including TYMS, which has not been reported in primary tumors (GISTIC 
method and test of equal proportions, FDR-adjusted p = 0.0023). CNA lesion 
profiles exhibiting different treatment responses were compared and we detected 
focal genomic divergences in post-treatment resistant lesions but not in 
responder lesions (two-tailed Fisher's Exact test, unadjusted p ≤ 0.005). The 
importance of examining metastatic lesions is highlighted by the fact that 15 
out of 18 independently validated CNA regions found to be associated with PFS in 
this study were only identified in the metastatic lesions and not in the primary 
tumors.
CONCLUSION: This investigation of genomic-phenotype associations in a large 
colorectal cancer liver metastases cohort identified novel molecular features 
associated with treatment response, supporting the clinical importance of 
collecting metastatic samples in a defined clinical setting.

BACKGROUND: DNA sequencing has unveiled extensive tumor heterogeneity in several 
different cancer types, with many exhibiting diverse subclonal populations. 
Identifying and tracing mutations throughout the expansion and progression of a 
tumor represents a significant challenge. Furthermore, prioritizing the subset 
of such mutations most likely to contribute to tumor evolution or that could 
serve as potential therapeutic targets represents an ongoing problem.
RESULTS: Here, we describe OncoGEMINI, a new tool designed for exploring the 
complex patterns and trajectory of somatic and inherited variation observed in 
heterogeneous tumors biopsied over the course of treatment. This is accomplished 
by creating a searchable database of variants that includes tumor sampling time 
points and allows for filtering methods that reflect specific changes in variant 
allele frequencies over time. Additionally, by incorporating existing 
annotations and resources that facilitate the interpretation of cancer mutations 
(e.g., CIViC, DGIdb), OncoGEMINI enables rapid searches for, and potential 
identification of, mutations that may be driving subclonal evolution.
CONCLUSIONS: By combining relevant genomic annotations alongside specific 
filtering tools, OncoGEMINI provides powerful and customizable approaches that 
enable the quick identification of individual tumor variants that meet specified 
criteria. It can be applied to a wide range of tumor-derived sequence data, but 
is especially designed for studies with multiple samples, including longitudinal 
datasets. It is available under an MIT license at 
github.com/fakedrtom/oncogemini .

Growing evidence is showing that acetylation plays an essential role in cancer, 
but studies on the impact of KDAC inhibition (KDACi) on the metabolic profile 
are still in their infancy. Here, we analyzed, by using an iTRAQ-based 
quantitative proteomics approach, the changes in the proteome of KRAS-mutated 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells in response to trichostatin-A 
(TSA) and nicotinamide (NAM) under normoxia and hypoxia. Part of this response 
was further validated by molecular and biochemical analyses and correlated with 
the proliferation rates, apoptotic cell death, and activation of ROS scavenging 
mechanisms in opposition to the ROS production. Despite the differences among 
the KDAC inhibitors, up-regulation of glycolysis, TCA cycle, oxidative 
phosphorylation and fatty acid synthesis emerged as a common metabolic response 
underlying KDACi. We also observed that some of the KDACi effects at metabolic 
levels are enhanced under hypoxia. Furthermore, we used a drug repositioning 
machine learning approach to list candidate metabolic therapeutic agents for 
KRAS mutated NSCLC. Together, these results allow us to better understand the 
metabolic regulations underlying KDACi in NSCLC, taking into account the 
microenvironment of tumors related to hypoxia, and bring new insights for the 
future rational design of new therapies.

Genotype-phenotype correlations are the basis of precision medicine of human 
genetic diseases. However, it remains a challenge for clinicians and researchers 
to conveniently access detailed individual-level clinical phenotypic features of 
patients with various genetic variants. To address this urgent need, we manually 
searched for genetic studies in PubMed and catalogued 8,309 genetic variants in 
1,288 genes from 17,738 patients with detailed clinical phenotypic features from 
1,855 publications. Based on genotype-phenotype correlations in this dataset, we 
developed an user-friendly online database called GPCards 
(http://genemed.tech/gpcards/), which not only provided the association between 
genetic diseases and disease genes, but also the prevalence of various clinical 
phenotypes related to disease genes and the patient-level mapping between these 
clinical phenotypes and genetic variants. To accelerate the interpretation of 
genetic variants, we integrated 62 well-known variant-level and gene-level 
genomic data sources, including functional predictions, allele frequencies in 
different populations, and disease-related information. Furthermore, GPCards 
enables automatic analyses of users' own genetic data, comprehensive annotation, 
prioritization of candidate functional variants, and identification of 
genotype-phenotype correlations using custom parameters. In conclusion, GPCards 
is expected to accelerate the interpretation of genotype-phenotype correlations, 
subtype classification, and candidate gene prioritisation in human genetic 
diseases.

The oncofetal IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) promotes tumor progression 
in a variety of solid tumors and its expression is associated with adverse 
prognosis. The main role proposed for IGF2BP1 in cancer cells is the 
stabilization of mRNAs encoding pro-oncogenic factors. Several IGF2BP1-RNA 
association studies, however, revealed a plethora of putative IGF2BP1-RNA 
targets. Thus, at present the main conserved target RNAs and pathways controlled 
by IGF2BP1 in cancer remain elusive. In this study, we present a set of genes 
and cancer hallmark pathways showing a conserved pattern of deregulation in 
dependence of IGF2BP1 expression in cancer cell lines. By the integrative 
analysis of these findings with publicly available cancer transcriptome and 
IGF2BP1-RNA association data, we compiled a set of prime candidate target mRNAs. 
These analyses confirm a pivotal role of IGF2BP1 in controlling cancer cell 
cycle progression and reveal novel cancer hallmark pathways influenced by 
IGF2BP1. For three novel target mRNAs identified by these studies, namely AURKA, 
HDLBP and YWHAZ, we confirm IGF2BP1 mRNA stabilization. In sum our findings 
confirm and expand previous findings on the pivotal role of IGF2BP1 in promoting 
oncogenic gene expression by stabilizing target mRNAs in a mainly 3'UTR, m6A-, 
miRNA-, and potentially AU-rich element dependent manner.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease or 
pathophysiological syndrome which has a low survival rate with abnormally 
elevated pulmonary artery pressure caused by known or unknown reasons. In 
addition, the pathogenesis of PAH is not fully understood. Therefore, it has 
become an urgent matter to search for clinical molecular markers of PAH, study 
the pathogenesis of PAH, and contribute to the development of new science-based 
PAH diagnosis and targeted treatment methods.
METHODS: In this study, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to 
downloaded a microarray dataset about PAH, and the differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) between PAH and normal control were screened out. Moreover, we 
performed the functional enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network analyses of the DEGs. In addition, the prediction of miRNA and 
transcriptional factor (TF) of hub genes and construction miRNA-TF-hub gene 
network were performed. Besides, the ROC curve was used to evaluate the 
diagnostic value of hub genes. Finally, the potential drug targets for the 5 
identified hub genes were screened out.
RESULTS: 69 DEGs were identified between PAH samples and normal samples. GO and 
KEGG pathway analyses revealed that these DEGs were mostly enriched in the 
inflammatory response and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, respectively. 
The miRNA-hub genes network was conducted subsequently with 131 miRNAs, 7 TFs, 
and 5 hub genes (CCL5, CXCL12, VCAM1, CXCR1, and SPP1) which screened out via 
constructing the PPI network. 17 drugs interacted with 5 hub genes were 
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Through bioinformatic analysis of microarray data sets, 5 hub genes 
(CCL5, CXCL12, VCAM1, CXCR1, and SPP1) were identified from DEGs between control 
samples and PAH samples. Studies showed that the five hub genes might play an 
important role in the development of PAH. These 5 hub genes might be potential 
biomarkers for diagnosis or targets for the treatment of PAH. In addition, our 
work also indicated that paying more attention on studies based on these 5 hub 
genes might help to understand the molecular mechanism of the development of 
PAH.

Drug development involves a deep understanding of the mechanisms of action and 
possible side effects of each drug, and sometimes results in the identification 
of new and unexpected uses for drugs, termed as drug repurposing. Both in case 
of serendipitous observations and systematic mechanistic explorations, 
confirmation of new indications for a drug requires hypothesis building around 
relevant drug-related data, such as molecular targets involved, and patient and 
cellular responses. These datasets are available in public repositories, but 
apart from sifting through the sheer amount of data imposing computational 
bottleneck, a major challenge is the difficulty in selecting which databases to 
use from an increasingly large number of available databases. The database 
selection is made harder by the lack of an overview of the types of data offered 
in each database. In order to alleviate these problems and to guide the end user 
through the drug repurposing efforts, we provide here a survey of 102 of the 
most promising and drug-relevant databases reported to date. We summarize the 
target coverage and types of data available in each database and provide several 
examples of how multi-database exploration can facilitate drug repurposing.

RNA viruses are responsible for many zoonotic diseases that post great 
challenges for public health. Effective therapeutics against these viral 
infections remain limited. Here, we deployed a computational framework for 
host-based drug repositioning to predict potential antiviral drugs from 2,352 
approved drugs and 1,062 natural compounds embedded in herbs of traditional 
Chinese medicine. By systematically interrogating public genetic screening data, 
we comprehensively cataloged host dependency genes (HDGs) that are indispensable 
for successful viral infection corresponding to 10 families and 29 species of 
RNA viruses. We then utilized these HDGs as potential drug targets and 
interrogated extensive drug-target interactions through database retrieval, 
literature mining, and de novo prediction using artificial intelligence-based 
algorithms. Repurposed drugs or natural compounds were proposed against many 
viral pathogens such as coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), flaviviruses, and influenza viruses. This 
study helps to prioritize promising drug candidates for in-depth evaluation 
against these virus-related diseases.

Measures of lung function are heritable, and thus, we sought to utilise genetics 
to propose drug-repurposing candidates that could improve respiratory outcomes. 
Lung function measures were found to be genetically correlated with seven 
druggable biochemical traits, with further evidence of a causal relationship 
between increased fasting glucose and diminished lung function. Moreover, we 
developed polygenic scores for lung function specifically within pathways with 
known drug targets and investigated their relationship with pulmonary phenotypes 
and gene expression in independent cohorts to prioritise individuals who may 
benefit from particular drug-repurposing opportunities. A transcriptome-wide 
association study (TWAS) of lung function was then performed which identified 
several drug-gene interactions with predicted lung function increasing modes of 
action. Drugs that regulate blood glucose were uncovered through both polygenic 
scoring and TWAS methodologies. In summary, we provided genetic justification 
for a number of novel drug-repurposing opportunities that could improve lung 
function.

Plain Language Summary: Chronic respiratory disorders like asthma affect around 
600 million people worldwide. Although these illnesses are widespread, they can 
have several different underlying causes, making them difficult to treat. Drugs 
that work well on one type of respiratory disorder may be completely ineffective 
on another. Understanding the biological and environmental factors that cause 
these illnesses will allow them to be treated more effectively by tailoring 
therapies to each patient. Reduced lung function is a factor in respiratory 
disorders and it can have many genetic causes. Studying the genes of patients 
with reduced lung function can reveal the genes involved, some of which may 
already be targets of existing drugs for other illnesses. So, could a patient’s 
genetics be used to repurpose existing drugs to treat their respiratory 
disorders? Reay et al. combined three methods to link genetics and biological 
processes to the causes of reduced lung function. The results reveal several 
factors that could lead to new treatments. In one example, reduced lung function 
showed a link to genes associated with high blood sugar. As such, treatments 
used in diabetes might help improve lung function in some patients. Reay et al. 
also developed a scoring system that could predict the efficacy of a treatment 
based on a patient’s genetics. The study suggests that COVID-19 infection could 
be affected by blood sugar levels too. Chronic respiratory disorders are a 
critical issue worldwide and have proven difficult to treat, but these results 
suggest a way to identify new therapies and target them to the right patients. 
The findings also support a connection between lung function and blood sugar 
levels. This implies that perhaps existing diabetes treatments – including diet 
and lifestyle changes aimed at reducing or limiting blood sugar – could be 
repurposed to treat respiratory disorders in some patients. The next step will 
be to perform clinical trials to test whether these therapies are in fact 
effective.

Improved and cheaper molecular diagnostics allow the shift from "one size fits 
all" therapies to personalised treatments targeting the individual tumor. 
However, the wealth of potential targets based on comprehensive sequencing 
remains a yet unsolved challenge that prevents its routine use in clinical 
practice. Thus, we designed a workflow that selects the most promising treatment 
targets based on multi-omics sequencing and in silico drug prediction. In this 
study we demonstrate the workflow with focus on bladder cancer (BLCA), as there 
are, to date, no reliable diagnostics available to predict the potential benefit 
of a therapeutic approach. Within the TCGA-BLCA cohort, our workflow identified 
a panel of 21 genes and 72 drugs that suggested personalized treatment for 95% 
of patients-including five genes not yet reported as prognostic markers for 
clinical testing in BLCA. The automated predictions were complemented by 
manually curated data, thus allowing for accurate sensitivity- or 
resistance-directed drug response predictions. We discuss potential improvements 
of drug-gene interaction databases on the basis of pitfalls that were identified 
during manual curation.

BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and 
rapidly spread worldwide. Researchers are trying to find a way to treat this 
disease as soon as possible. The present study aimed to identify the genes 
involved in COVID-19 and find a new drug target therapy. Currently, there are no 
effective drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile, drug discovery approaches 
are time-consuming and costly. To address this challenge, this study utilized a 
network-based drug repurposing strategy to rapidly identify potential drugs 
targeting SARS-CoV-2. To this end, seven potential drugs were proposed for 
COVID-19 treatment using protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. 
First, 524 proteins in humans that have interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 virus 
were collected, and then the PPI network was reconstructed for these collected 
proteins. Next, the target miRNAs of the mentioned module genes were separately 
obtained from the miRWalk 2.0 database because of the important role of miRNAs 
in biological processes and were reported as an important clue for future 
analysis. Finally, the list of the drugs targeting module genes was obtained 
from the DGIDb database, and the drug-gene network was separately reconstructed 
for the obtained protein modules.
RESULTS: Based on the network analysis of the PPI network, seven clusters of 
proteins were specified as the complexes of proteins which are more associated 
with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Moreover, seven therapeutic candidate drugs were 
identified to control gene regulation in COVID-19. PACLITAXEL, as the most 
potent therapeutic candidate drug and previously mentioned as a therapy for 
COVID-19, had four gene targets in two different modules. The other six 
candidate drugs, namely, BORTEZOMIB, CARBOPLATIN, CRIZOTINIB, CYTARABINE, 
DAUNORUBICIN, and VORINOSTAT, some of which were previously discovered to be 
efficient against COVID-19, had three gene targets in different modules. 
Eventually, CARBOPLATIN, CRIZOTINIB, and CYTARABINE drugs were found as novel 
potential drugs to be investigated as a therapy for COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Our computational strategy for predicting repurposable candidate 
drugs against COVID-19 provides efficacious and rapid results for therapeutic 
purposes. However, further experimental analysis and testing such as clinical 
applicability, toxicity, and experimental validations are required to reach a 
more accurate and improved treatment. Our proposed complexes of proteins and 
associated miRNAs, along with discovered candidate drugs might be a starting 
point for further analysis by other researchers in this urgency of the COVID-19 
pandemic.

A global, comprehensive and open access listing of approved anticancer drugs 
does not currently exist. Partial information is available from multiple 
sources, including regulatory authorities, national formularies and scientific 
agencies. Many such data sources include drugs used in oncology for supportive 
care, diagnostic or other non-antineoplastic uses. We describe a methodology to 
combine and cleanse relevant data from multiple sources to produce an open 
access database of drugs licensed specifically for therapeutic antineoplastic 
purposes. The resulting list is provided as an open access database, 
(http://www.redo-project.org/cancer-drugs-db/), so that it may be used by 
researchers as input for further research projects, for example literature-based 
text mining for drug repurposing.

Molecular precision oncology faces two major challenges: first, to identify 
relevant and actionable molecular variants in a rapidly changing field and 
second, to provide access to a broad patient population. Here, we report a 
four-year experience of the Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) of the Comprehensive 
Cancer Center Freiburg (Germany) including workflows and process optimizations. 
This retrospective single-center study includes data on 488 patients enrolled in 
the MTB from February 2015 through December 2018. Recommendations include 
individual molecular diagnostics, molecular stratified therapies, assessment of 
treatment adherence and patient outcomes including overall survival. The 
majority of MTB patients presented with stage IV oncologic malignancies (90.6%) 
and underwent an average of 2.1 previous lines of therapy. Individual diagnostic 
recommendations were given to 487 patients (99.8%). A treatment recommendation 
was given in 264 of all cases (54.1%) which included a molecularly matched 
treatment in 212 patients (43.4%). The 264 treatment recommendations were 
implemented in 76 patients (28.8%). Stable disease was observed in 19 patients 
(25.0%), 17 had partial response (22.4%) and five showed a complete remission 
(6.6%). An objective response was achieved in 28.9% of cases with implemented 
recommendations and for 4.5% of the total population (22 of 488 patients). By 
optimizing the MTB workflow, case-discussions per session increased 
significantly while treatment adherence and outcome remained stable over time. 
Our data demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of molecular-guided 
personalized therapy for cancer patients in a clinical routine setting showing a 
low but robust and durable disease control rate over time.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common supraventricular arrhythmias 
worldwide. However, the specific molecular mechanism underlying AF remains 
unclear. Our study is aimed at identifying pivotal microRNAs (miRNAs) and 
targeting genes associated with persistent AF (pAF) using bioinformatics 
analysis. Three gene expression array datasets (GSE31821, GSE41177, and 
GSE79768) and an miRNA expression array dataset (GSE68475) associated with pAF 
were downloaded. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the 
LIMMA package, and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were screened from 
GSE68475. Target genes for DEMs were predicted using the miRTarBase database, 
and intersections between these target genes and DEGs were selected for further 
analysis, including the generation of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, 
miRNA-transcription factor-target regulatory network, and drug-gene network. A 
total of 264 DEGs and 40 DEMs were identified between the pAF and control 
groups. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of up- and downregulated DEGs 
were performed. The common genes (CGs) were primarily enriched in the 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase- (PI3K-) protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, 
negative regulation of cell division, and response to hypoxia. The PPI network, 
miRNA-transcription factor-target regulatory network, and drug-gene network were 
constructed using Cytoscape. The present study revealed several novel miRNAs and 
genes involved in pAF. We speculated that miR-4298, miR-3125, miR-4306, and 
miR-671-5p could represent significant miRNAs that act on the target gene 
superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) during the development of pAF and may serve as 
essential biomarkers for pAF diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, MYC might 
function in pAF pathogenesis through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths. Most colorectal cancer 
patients eventually develop chemoresistance to the current standard-of-care 
therapies. Here, we used patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids to 
demonstrate that resistant tumor cells undergo significant chromatin changes in 
response to oxaliplatin treatment. Integrated transcriptomic and chromatin 
accessibility analyses using ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq identified a group of genes 
associated with significantly increased chromatin accessibility and upregulated 
gene expression. CRISPR/Cas9 silencing of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 
(FGFR1) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) helped overcome oxaliplatin resistance. 
Similarly, treatment with oxaliplatin in combination with an FGFR1 inhibitor 
(PD166866) or an antagonist of OXTR (L-368,899) suppressed chemoresistant 
organoids. However, oxaliplatin treatment did not activate either FGFR1 or OXTR 
expression in another resistant organoid, suggesting that chromatin 
accessibility changes are patient-specific. The use of patient-derived cancer 
organoids in combination with transcriptomic and chromatin profiling may lead to 
precision treatments to overcome chemoresistance in colorectal cancer.

Direct drug targeting of mutated proteins in cancer is not always possible and 
efficacy can be nullified by compensating protein-protein interactions (PPIs). 
Here, we establish an in silico pipeline to identify specific PPI sub-networks 
containing mutated proteins as potential targets, which we apply to mutation 
data of four different leukaemias. Our method is based on extracting cyclic 
interactions of a small number of proteins topologically and functionally linked 
in the Protein-Protein Interaction Network (PPIN), which we call short loop 
network motifs (SLM). We uncover a new property of PPINs named 'short loop 
commonality' to measure indirect PPIs occurring via common SLM interactions. 
This detects 'modules' of PPI networks enriched with annotated biological 
functions of proteins containing mutation hotspots, exemplified by FLT3 and 
other receptor tyrosine kinase proteins. We further identify functional 
dependency or mutual exclusivity of short loop commonality pairs in large-scale 
cellular CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening data. Our pipeline provides a new 
strategy for identifying new therapeutic targets for drug discovery.

BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has cost lives and 
economic hardships globally. Various studies have found a number of different 
factors, such as hyperinflammation and exhausted/suppressed T cell responses to 
the etiological SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), being associated with severe 
COVID-19. However, sieving the causative from associative factors of respiratory 
dysfunction has remained rudimentary.
METHODS: We postulated that the host responses causative of respiratory 
dysfunction would track most closely with disease progression and resolution and 
thus be differentiated from other factors that are statistically associated with 
but not causative of severe COVID-19. To track the temporal dynamics of the host 
responses involved, we examined the changes in gene expression in whole blood of 
6 severe and 4 non-severe COVID-19 patients across 15 different timepoints 
spanning the nadir of respiratory function.
FINDINGS: We found that neutrophil activation but not type I interferon 
signaling transcripts tracked most closely with disease progression and 
resolution. Moreover, transcripts encoding for protein phosphorylation, 
particularly the serine-threonine kinases, many of which have known T cell 
proliferation and activation functions, were increased after and may thus 
contribute to the upswing of respiratory function. Notably, these associative 
genes were targeted by dexamethasone, but not methylprednisolone, which is 
consistent with efficacy outcomes in clinical trials.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest neutrophil activation as a critical factor 
of respiratory dysfunction in COVID-19. Drugs that target this pathway could be 
potentially repurposed for the treatment of severe COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION: Researchers worldwide with great endeavor searching and repurpose 
drugs might be potentially useful in fighting newly emerged coronavirus. These 
drugs show inhibition but also show side effects and complications too. On 
December 27, 2020, 80,926,235 cases have been reported worldwide. Specifically, 
in Pakistan, 471,335 has been reported with inconsiderable deaths.
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Identification of COVID-19 drugs pathway through drug-gene 
and gene-gene interaction to find out the most important genes involved in the 
pathway to deal with the actual cause of side effects beyond the beneficent 
effects of the drugs.
METHODOLOGY: The medicines used to treat COVID-19 are retrieved from the Drug 
Bank. The drug-gene interaction was performed using the Drug Gene Interaction 
Database to check the relation between the genes and the drugs. The networks of 
genes are developed by Gene MANIA, while Cytoscape is used to check the active 
functional association of the targeted gene. The developed systems 
cross-validated using the EnrichNet tool and identify drug genes' concerned 
pathways using Reactome and STRING.
RESULTS: Five drugs Azithromycin, Bevacizumab, CQ, HCQ, and Lopinavir, are 
retrieved. The drug-gene interaction shows several genes that are targeted by 
the drug. Gene MANIA interaction network shows the functional association of the 
genes like co-expression, physical interaction, predicted, genetic interaction, 
co-localization, and shared protein domains.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests the pathways for each drug in which targeted 
genes and medicines play a crucial role, which will help experts in-vitro 
overcome and deal with the side effects of these drugs, as we find out the 
in-silico gene analysis for the COVID-19 drugs.

Characterizing the interactions that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNAs make with host cell 
proteins during infection can improve our understanding of viral RNA functions 
and the host innate immune response. Using RNA antisense purification and mass 
spectrometry, we identified up to 104 human proteins that directly and 
specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in infected human cells. We integrated the 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with changes in proteome abundance induced by viral 
infection and linked interactome proteins to cellular pathways relevant to 
SARS-CoV-2 infections. We demonstrated by genetic perturbation that cellular 
nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) and La-related protein 1 (LARP1), two of the 
most strongly enriched viral RNA binders, restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication in 
infected cells and provide a global map of their direct RNA contact sites. 
Pharmacological inhibition of three other RNA interactome members, PPIA, ATP1A1, 
and the ARP2/3 complex, reduced viral replication in two human cell lines. The 
identification of host dependency factors and defence strategies as presented in 
this work will improve the design of targeted therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.

Interrogation of disease-relevant cellular and molecular traits exhibited by 
genetically diverse cell populations enables in vitro systems genetics 
approaches for uncovering the basic properties of cellular function and 
identity. Primary cells, stem cells, and organoids derived from genetically 
diverse mouse strains, such as Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred 
populations, offer the opportunity for parallel in vitro/in vivo screening. 
These panels provide genetic resolution for variant discovery and functional 
characterization, as well as disease modeling and in vivo validation 
capabilities. Here we review mouse cellular systems genetics approaches for 
characterizing the influence of genetic variation on signaling networks and 
phenotypic diversity, and we discuss approaches for data integration and 
cross-species validation.

often co-occur. However, conflicting evidence exists, and the etiology as well 
as biological mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remain unknown. Utilizing 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we comprehensively assessed the 
relationship between endometriosis and depression. Single nucleotide 
polymorphism effect concordance analysis (SECA) found a significant genetic 
overlap between endometriosis and depression (PFsig-permuted = 9.99 × 10-4). 
Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) analysis estimated a positive and 
highly significant genetic correlation between the two traits (rG = 0.27, 
P = 8.85 × 10-27). A meta-analysis of endometriosis and depression GWAS (sample 
size = 709,111), identified 20 independent genome-wide significant loci 
(P < 5 × 10-8), of which eight are novel. Mendelian randomization analysis (MR) 
suggests a causal effect of depression on endometriosis. Combining gene-based 
association results across endometriosis and depression GWAS, we identified 22 
genes with a genome-wide significant Fisher's combined P value 
(FCPgene < 2.75 × 10-6). Genes with a nominal gene-based association 
(Pgene < 0.05) were significantly enriched across endometriosis and depression 
(Pbinomial-test = 2.90 × 10-4). Also, genes overlapping the two traits at 
Pgene < 0.1 (Pbinomial-test = 1.31 × 10-5) were significantly enriched for the 
biological pathways 'cell-cell adhesion', 'inositol phosphate metabolism', 
'Hippo-Merlin signaling dysregulation' and 'gastric mucosa abnormality'. These 
results reveal a shared genetic etiology for endometriosis and depression. 
Indeed, additional analyses found evidence of a causal association between each 
of endometriosis and depression and at least one abnormal condition of gastric 
mucosa. Our study confirms the comorbidity of endometriosis and depression, 
implicates links with gastric mucosa abnormalities in their causal pathways and 
reveals potential therapeutic targets for further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Considering the high invasiveness and mortality of glioma as well as 
the unclear key genes and signaling pathways involved in the development of 
gliomas, there is a strong need to find potential gene biomarkers and available 
drugs.
METHODS: Eight glioma samples and twelve control samples were analyzed on the 
GSE31095 datasets, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained via 
the R software. The related glioma genes were further acquired from the text 
mining. Additionally, Venny program was used to screen out the common genes of 
the two gene sets and DAVID analysis was used to conduct the corresponding gene 
ontology analysis and cell signal pathway enrichment. We also constructed the 
protein interaction network of common genes through STRING, and selected the 
important modules for further drug-gene analysis. The existing antitumor drugs 
that targeted these module genes were screened to explore their efficacy in 
glioma treatment.
RESULTS: The gene set obtained from text mining was intersected with the 
previously obtained DEGs, and 128 common genes were obtained. Through the 
functional enrichment analysis of the identified 128 DEGs, a hub gene module 
containing 25 genes was obtained. Combined with the functional terms in 
GSE109857 dataset, some overlap of the enriched function terms are both in 
GSE31095 and GSE109857. Finally, 4 antitumor drugs were identified through 
drug-gene interaction analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified that two potential genes and their 
corresponding four antitumor agents could be used as targets and drugs for 
glioma exploration.

BACKGROUND: Clinical-grade whole-genome sequencing (cWGS) has the potential to 
become the standard of care within the clinic because of its breadth of coverage 
and lack of bias towards certain regions of the genome. Colorectal cancer 
presents a difficult treatment paradigm, with over 40% of patients presenting at 
diagnosis with metastatic disease. We hypothesised that cWGS coupled with 3' 
transcriptome analysis would give new insights into colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Patients underwent PCR-free whole-genome sequencing and alignment and 
variant calling using a standardised pipeline to output SNVs, indels, SVs and 
CNAs. Additional insights into the mutational signatures and tumour biology were 
gained by the use of 3' RNA-seq.
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were studied in total. Driver analysis identified 
the Wnt pathway gene APC as the only consistently mutated driver in colorectal 
cancer. Alterations in the PI3K/mTOR pathways were seen as previously observed 
in CRC. Multiple private CNAs, SVs and gene fusions were unique to individual 
tumours. Approximately 30% of patients had a tumour mutational burden of > 10 
mutations/Mb of DNA, suggesting suitability for immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical whole-genome sequencing offers a potential avenue for the 
identification of private genomic variation that may confer sensitivity to 
targeted agents and offer patients new options for targeted therapies.

Synthetic lethality is emerging as an important cancer therapeutic paradigm, 
while the comprehensive selective treatment opportunities for various tumors 
have not yet been explored. We develop the Synthetic Lethality Knowledge Graph 
(SLKG), presenting the tumor therapy landscape of synthetic lethality (SL) and 
synthetic dosage lethality (SDL). SLKG integrates the large-scale entity of 
different tumors, drugs and drug targets by exploring a comprehensive set of SL 
and SDL pairs. The overall therapy landscape is prioritized to identify the best 
repurposable drug candidates and drug combinations with literature supports, in 
vitro pharmacologic evidence or clinical trial records. Finally, cladribine, an 
FDA-approved multiple sclerosis treatment drug, is selected and identified as a 
repurposable drug for treating melanoma with CDKN2A mutation by in vitro 
validation, serving as a demonstrating SLKG utility example for novel tumor 
therapy discovery. Collectively, SLKG forms the computational basis to uncover 
cancer-specific susceptibilities and therapy strategies based on the principle 
of synthetic lethality.

Identification of driver genes from mass non-functional passenger genes in 
cancers is still a critical challenge. Here, an effective and no parameter 
algorithm, named DriverSubNet, is presented for detecting driver genes by 
effectively mining the mutation and gene expression information based on 
subnetwork enrichment analysis. Compared with the existing classic methods, 
DriverSubNet can rank driver genes and filter out passenger genes more 
efficiently in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, as indicated by the 
analysis of four cancer datasets. The method recovered about 50% more known 
cancer driver genes in the top 100 detected genes than those found in other 
algorithms. Intriguingly, DriverSubNet was able to find these unknown cancer 
driver genes which could act as potential therapeutic targets and useful 
prognostic biomarkers for cancer patients. Therefore, DriverSubNet may act as a 
useful tool for the identification of driver genes by subnetwork enrichment 
analysis.

The extensive drug resistance requires rational approaches to design 
personalized combinatorial treatments that exploit patient-specific therapeutic 
vulnerabilities to selectively target disease-driving cell subpopulations. To 
solve the combinatorial explosion challenge, we implemented an effective machine 
learning approach that prioritizes patient-customized drug combinations with a 
desired synergy-efficacy-toxicity balance by combining single-cell RNA 
sequencing with ex vivo single-agent testing in scarce patient-derived primary 
cells. When applied to two diagnostic and two refractory acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) patient cases, each with a different genetic background, we accurately 
predicted patient-specific combinations that not only resulted in synergistic 
cancer cell co-inhibition but also were capable of targeting specific AML cell 
subpopulations that emerge in differing stages of disease pathogenesis or 
treatment regimens. Our functional precision oncology approach provides an 
unbiased means for systematic identification of personalized combinatorial 
regimens that selectively co-inhibit leukemic cells while avoiding inhibition of 
nonmalignant cells, thereby increasing their likelihood for clinical 
translation.

The development of new computational approaches that are able to design the 
correct personalized drugs is the crucial therapeutic issue in cancer research. 
However, tumor heterogeneity is the main obstacle to developing patient-specific 
single drugs or combinations of drugs that already exist in clinics. In this 
study, we developed a computational approach that integrates copy number 
alteration, gene expression, and a protein interaction network of 73 basal 
breast cancer samples. 2509 prognostic genes harboring a copy number alteration 
were identified using survival analysis, and a protein-protein interaction 
network considering the direct interactions was created. Each patient was 
described by a specific combination of seven altered hub proteins that fully 
characterize the 73 basal breast cancer patients. We suggested the optimal 
combination therapy for each patient considering drug-protein interactions. Our 
approach is able to confirm well-known cancer related genes and suggest novel 
potential drug target genes. In conclusion, we presented a new computational 
approach in breast cancer to deal with the intra-tumor heterogeneity towards 
personalized cancer therapy.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily-related genes and potential therapeutic drugs 
for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients based on transcriptome and epigenome. 
Methods: Gene expression data, corresponding clinical data, and methylation data 
of GBM samples and normal samples in the TCGA-GBM and GTEx datasets were 
downloaded. The TNF-related genes were obtained, respectively, from two groups 
in the TCGA dataset. Then, the TNF-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were investigated between two groups, followed by enrichment analysis. Moreover, 
TNF superfamily-related gene expression and upstream methylation regulation were 
investigated to explore candidate genes and the prognostic model. Finally, the 
protein expression level of candidate genes was performed, followed by drug 
prediction analysis. Results: A total of 41 DEGs including 4 ligands, 18 
receptors, and 19 downstream signaling molecules were revealed between two 
groups. These DEGs were mainly enriched in pathways like TNF signaling and 
functions like response to TNF. A total of 5 methylation site-regulated 
prognosis-related genes including TNF Receptor Superfamily Member (TNFRSF) 12A, 
TNFRSF11B, and CD40 were explored. The prognosis model constructed by 5 genes 
showed a well-prediction effect on the current dataset and verification dataset. 
Finally, drug prediction analysis showed that zoledronic acid (ZA)-TNFRSF11B was 
the unique drug-gene relation in both two databases. Conclusion: 
Methylation-driven gene TNFRSF12A might participate in the development of GBM 
via response to the TNF biological process and TNF signaling pathway and 
significantly associated with prognosis. ZA that targets TNFRSF11B expression 
might be a potential effective drug for clinical treatment of GBM.

The prediction of drug-target interaction (DTI) is a key step in drug 
repositioning. In recent years, many studies have tried to use matrix 
factorization to predict DTI, but they only use known DTIs and ignore the 
features of drug and target expression profiles, resulting in limited prediction 
performance. In this study, we propose a new DTI prediction model named 
AdvB-DTI. Within this model, the features of drug and target expression profiles 
are associated with Adversarial Bayesian Personalized Ranking through matrix 
factorization. Firstly, according to the known drug-target relationships, a set 
of ternary partial order relationships is generated. Next, these partial order 
relationships are used to train the latent factor matrix of drugs and targets 
using the Adversarial Bayesian Personalized Ranking method, and the matrix 
factorization is improved by the features of drug and target expression 
profiles. Finally, the scores of drug-target pairs are achieved by the inner 
product of latent factors, and the DTI prediction is performed based on the 
score ranking. The proposed model effectively takes advantage of the idea of 
learning to rank to overcome the problem of data sparsity, and perturbation 
factors are introduced to make the model more robust. Experimental results show 
that our model could achieve a better DTI prediction performance.

Background: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Remodeling of 
the scleral extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in the 
development of glaucoma. The aim of this study was to identify the key genes and 
pathways for the ECM remodeling of sclera in glaucoma by bioinformatics analysis 
and to explore potential therapeutic agents for glaucoma management. Methods: 
Genes associated with glaucoma, sclera and ECM remodeling were detected using 
the text mining tool pubmed2ensembl, and assigned Gene Ontology (GO) biological 
process terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways using 
the GeneCodis program. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was 
constructed by STRING and visualized in Cytoscape, module analysis was performed 
using the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plugin, and GO and KEGG analyses 
of the gene modules were performed using the Database of Annotation, 
Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) platform. The genes that 
clustered in the significant module were selected as core genes, and functions 
and pathways of the core genes were visualized using ClueGO and CluePedia. 
Lastly, the drug-gene interaction database was used to explore drug-gene 
interactions of the core genes to find drug candidates for glaucoma. Results: We 
identified 125 genes common to "Glaucoma", "Sclera", and "ECM remodeling" by 
text mining. Gene functional enrichment analysis yielded 30 enriched GO terms 
and 20 associated KEGG pathways. A PPI network that included 60 nodes with 249 
edges was constructed, and three gene modules were obtained using the MCODE. We 
selected 13 genes that clustered in module 1 as core candidate genes that were 
associated mainly with ECM degradation and cell proliferation and division. The 
HIF-1 signaling pathway, FOXO signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and 
TGFB signaling pathway were found to be enriched. We found that 11 of the 13 
selected genes could be targeted by 26 existing drugs. Conclusions: The results 
showed that VEGFA, TGFB1, TGFB2, TGFB3, IGF2, IGF1, EGF, FN1, KNG1, TIMP1, 
SERPINE1, THBS1, and VWF were potential key genes involved to scleral ECM 
remodeling. Furthermore, 26 drugs were identified as potential therapeutic 
agents for glaucoma treatment and management.

Computational approaches to predict drug sensitivity can promote precision 
anticancer therapeutics. Generalizable and explainable models are of critical 
importance for translation to guide personalized treatment and are often 
overlooked in favor of prediction performance. Here, we propose PathDSP: a 
pathway-based model for drug sensitivity prediction that integrates chemical 
structure information with enrichment of cancer signaling pathways across 
drug-associated genes, gene expression, mutation and copy number variation data 
to predict drug response on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer dataset. 
Using a deep neural network, we outperform state-of-the-art deep learning 
models, while demonstrating good generalizability a separate dataset of the 
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia as well as provide explainable results, 
demonstrated through case studies that are in line with current knowledge. 
Additionally, our pathway-based model achieved a good performance when 
predicting unseen drugs and cells, with potential utility for drug development 
and for guiding individualized medicine.

We conducted genome-wide association analyses of over 250,000 participants of 
European (EUR) and African (AFR) ancestry from the Million Veteran Program using 
electronic health record-validated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
diagnosis and quantitative symptom phenotypes. Applying genome-wide multiple 
testing correction, we identified three significant loci in European 
case-control analyses and 15 loci in quantitative symptom analyses. Genomic 
structural equation modeling indicated tight coherence of a PTSD symptom factor 
that shares genetic variance with a distinct internalizing 
(mood-anxiety-neuroticism) factor. Partitioned heritability indicated enrichment 
in several cortical and subcortical regions, and imputed genetically regulated 
gene expression in these regions was used to identify potential drug 
repositioning candidates. These results validate the biological coherence of the 
PTSD syndrome, inform its relationship to comorbid anxiety and depressive 
disorders and provide new considerations for treatment.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are characterized as multi-targeted anticancer 
agents that lack specificity, leading to cardiovascular adverse effects. To 
date, there are no reliable means to predict the cardiotoxicity of TKIs under 
development. The present study assessed the usual variants of genes to determine 
the molecular targets of TKIs associated with heart failure (HF). Gene or gene 
products affected by TKIs were assessed using the Drug Gene Interaction 
Database. These genes were investigated in genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) datasets associated with HF at a genome-wide significant level 
(P<1×10-5). Subsequently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reached 
the established GWAS threshold (P<5×10-8) were investigated for genome-wide 
significance. Based on a threshold score of 3, nine gene loci yielded 
associations according to their biological function using RegulomeDB. Finally, 
comprehensive functional analysis of SNPs was performed using bioinformatics 
databases to identify potential drug targets. Using rSNPBase, rs7115242, 
rs143160639 and rs870064 were found to interfere with proximal transcription 
regulation, while rs7115242, rs143160639 and rs117153772 were involved in distal 
regulation, and most SNPs participated in post-transcriptional RNA binding 
protein-mediated regulation. rs191188930 on platelet-derived growth factor 
receptor (PDGFR) α was associated with numerous TKI drugs, including sunitinib, 
pazopanib, sorafenib, dasatinib and nilotinib. Using RegulomeDB and HaploReg 
v4.1, rs191188930 was predicted to be located in enhancer histone markers. 
PhenoScanner GWAS analysis revealed that rs191188930 was associated with other 
diseases or phenotypes, in addition to HF. Genotype-Tissue Expression analysis 
indicated that the PDGFRα gene had the highest median expression in 
'Cells-Transformed fibroblasts', and the Search Tool for the Retrieval of 
Interacting Genes/Proteins revealed the protein-protein interaction network of 
PDGFRα. The present findings demonstrated the overlap of TKI-induced genes and 
those mediating HF risk, suggesting molecular mechanisms potentially responsible 
for TKI-induced HF risk. Additionally, the present genetic study may be helpful 
to further investigate off-target drug effects.

Genetic coessentiality analysis, a computational approach which identifies genes 
sharing a common effect on cell fitness across large-scale screening datasets, 
has emerged as a powerful tool to identify functional relationships between 
human genes. However, widespread implementation of coessentiality to study 
individual genes and pathways is limited by systematic biases in existing 
coessentiality approaches and accessibility barriers for investigators without 
computational expertise. We created FIREWORKS, a method and interactive tool for 
the construction and statistical analysis of coessentiality networks centered 
around gene(s) provided by the user. FIREWORKS incorporates a novel bias 
reduction approach to reduce false discoveries, enables restriction of 
coessentiality analyses to custom subsets of cell lines, and integrates 
multiomic and drug-gene interaction datasets to investigate and target 
contextual gene essentiality. We demonstrate the broad utility of FIREWORKS 
through case vignettes investigating gene function and specialization, indirect 
therapeutic targeting of "undruggable" proteins, and context-specific rewiring 
of genetic networks.

OBJECTIVES: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor which is the most 
common and aggressive type of central nervous system cancer, with high morbidity 
and mortality. Despite lots of systematic studies on the molecular mechanism of 
glioblastoma, the pathogenesis is still unclear, and effective therapies are 
relatively rare with surgical resection as the frequently therapeutic 
intervention. Identification of fundamental molecules and gene networks 
associated with initiation is critical in glioblastoma drug discovery. In this 
study, an approach for the prediction of potential drug was developed based on 
perturbation-induced gene expression signatures.
METHODS: We first collected RNA-seq data of 12 pairs of glioblastoma samples and 
adjacent normal samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by DESeq2, and 
coexpression networks were analyzed with weighted gene correlation network 
analysis (WGCNA). Furthermore, key driver genes were detected based on the 
differentially expressed genes and potential chemotherapeutic drugs and targeted 
drugs were found by correlating the gene expression profiles with drug 
perturbation database. Finally, RNA-seq data of glioblastoma from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was collected as an independent validation dataset 
to verify our findings.
RESULTS: We identified 1771 significantly DEGs with 446 upregulated genes and 
1325 downregulated genes. A total of 24 key drivers were found in the 
upregulated gene set, and 81 key drivers were found in the downregulated gene 
set. We screened the Crowd Extracted Expression of Differential Signatures 
(CREEDS) database to identify drug perturbations that could reverse the key 
factors of glioblastoma, and a total of 354 drugs were obtained with p value < 
10-10. Finally, 7 drugs that could turn down the expression of upregulated 
factors and 3 drugs that could reverse the expression of downregulated key 
factors were selected as potential glioblastoma drugs. In addition, similar 
results were obtained through the analysis of TCGA as independent dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provided a framework of workflow for potential 
therapeutic drug discovery and predicted 10 potential drugs for glioblastoma 
therapy.

A year after the initial outbreak, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 
virus remains a serious threat to global health, while current treatment options 
are insufficient to bring major improvements. The aim of this study is to 
identify repurposable drug candidates with a potential to reverse transcriptomic 
alterations in the host cells infected by SARS-CoV-2. We have developed a 
rational computational pipeline to filter publicly available transcriptomic 
datasets of SARS-CoV-2-infected biosamples based on their responsiveness to the 
virus, to generate a list of relevant differentially expressed genes, and to 
identify drug candidates for repurposing using LINCS connectivity map. Pathway 
enrichment analysis was performed to place the results into biological context. 
We identified 37 structurally heterogeneous drug candidates and revealed several 
biological processes as druggable pathways. These pathways include metabolic and 
biosynthetic processes, cellular developmental processes, immune response and 
signaling pathways, with steroid metabolic process being targeted by half of the 
drug candidates. The pipeline developed in this study integrates biological 
knowledge with rational study design and can be adapted for future more 
comprehensive studies. Our findings support further investigations of some drugs 
currently in clinical trials, such as itraconazole and imatinib, and suggest 31 
previously unexplored drugs as treatment options for COVID-19.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is caused by multiple biological factors. Therefore, 
it will be more meaningful to study the prognosis from the perspective of omics 
integration. Given the significance of epigenetic modification and immunity in 
tumorigenesis and development, we tried to combine aberrant methylation and 
tumor infiltration CD8 T cell-related genes to build a prognostic model, to 
explore the key biomarkers of early-stage LUAD. On the basis of RNA-seq and 
methylation microarray data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 
differentially expressed genes and aberrant methylated genes were calculated 
with "DEseq2" and "ChAMP" packages, respectively. A Chi-square test was 
performed to obtain methylation driver genes. Weighted correlation network 
analysis (WGCNA) was utilized to mine cancer biomarkers related to CD8 T cells. 
With the consequences of univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis and least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) COX regression analysis, the 
prognostic index based on 17 methylation driver genes (ZNF677, FAM83A, TRIM58, 
CLDN6, NKD1, NFE2L3, FKBP5, ITGA5, ASCL2, SLC24A4, WNT3A, TMEM171, PTPRH, ITPKB, 
ITGA2, SLC6A17, and CCDC81) and four CD8 T cell-related genes (SPDL1, E2F7, TK1, 
and TYMS) was successfully established, which could make valuable predictions 
for the survival risk of patients with early-stage LUAD.

The task of predicting the interactions between drugs and targets plays a key 
role in the process of drug discovery. There is a need to develop novel and 
efficient prediction approaches in order to avoid costly and laborious yet 
not-always-deterministic experiments to determine drug-target interactions 
(DTIs) by experiments alone. These approaches should be capable of identifying 
the potential DTIs in a timely manner. In this article, we describe the data 
required for the task of DTI prediction followed by a comprehensive catalog 
consisting of machine learning methods and databases, which have been proposed 
and utilized to predict DTIs. The advantages and disadvantages of each set of 
methods are also briefly discussed. Lastly, the challenges one may face in 
prediction of DTI using machine learning approaches are highlighted and we 
conclude by shedding some lights on important future research directions.

BACKGROUND: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an adverse reaction caused by 
the intake of drugs of common use that produces liver damage. The impact of DILI 
is estimated to affect around 20 in 100,000 inhabitants worldwide each year. 
Despite being one of the main causes of liver failure, the pathophysiology and 
mechanisms of DILI are poorly understood. In the present study, we developed an 
ensemble learning approach based on different features (CMap gene expression, 
chemical structures, drug targets) to predict drugs that might cause DILI and 
gain a better understanding of the mechanisms linked to the adverse reaction.
RESULTS: We searched for gene signatures in CMap gene expression data by using 
two approaches: phenotype-gene associations data from DisGeNET, and a 
non-parametric test comparing gene expression of DILI-Concern and 
No-DILI-Concern drugs (as per DILIrank definitions). The average accuracy of the 
classifiers in both approaches was 69%. We used chemical structures as features, 
obtaining an accuracy of 65%. The combination of both types of features produced 
an accuracy around 63%, but improved the independent hold-out test up to 67%. 
The use of drug-target associations as feature obtained the best accuracy (70%) 
in the independent hold-out test.
CONCLUSIONS: When using CMap gene expression data, searching for a specific gene 
signature among the landmark genes improves the quality of the classifiers, but 
it is still limited by the intrinsic noise of the dataset. When using chemical 
structures as a feature, the structural diversity of the known DILI-causing 
drugs hampers the prediction, which is a similar problem as for the use of gene 
expression information. The combination of both features did not improve the 
quality of the classifiers but increased the robustness as shown on independent 
hold-out tests. The use of drug-target associations as feature improved the 
prediction, specially the specificity, and the results were comparable to 
previous research studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among the 
elderly and has become a growing global health problem causing great concern. 
However, the pathogenesis of AD is unclear and no specific therapeutics are 
available to provide the sustained remission of the disease. In this study, we 
used comprehensive bioinformatics to determine 158 potential genes, whose 
expression levels changed between the entorhinal and temporal lobe cortex 
samples from cognitively normal individuals and patients with AD. Then, we 
clustered these genes in the protein-protein interaction analysis and identified 
six significant genes that had more biological functions. Besides, we conducted 
a drug-gene interaction analysis of module genes in the drug-gene interaction 
database and obtained 26 existing drugs that might be applied for the prevention 
and treatment of AD. In addition, a predictive model was built based on the 
selected genes using different machine learning algorithms to identify 
individuals with AD. These findings may provide new insights into AD therapy.

PURPOSE: Retinal pigment epithelial cell autophagy dysfunction, cellular 
senescence, and the retinal inflammatory response are key pathogenic factors in 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which has been reviewed in our 
previously work in 2019. This study aims to identify genes collectively involved 
in these three biological processes and target drugs in AMD.
METHODS: The pubmed2ensembl database was used to perform text mining. The 
GeneCodis database was applied to analyze gene ontology biological process and 
the KEGG pathway. The STRING database was used to analyze protein-protein 
interaction analysis and hub genes were identified by the Cytoscape software. 
The Drug Gene Interaction Database was used to perform drug-gene interactions.
RESULTS: We identified 62 genes collectively involved in AMD, autophagy, 
cellular senescence, and inflammatory response, 19 biological processes 
including 42 genes, 11 enriched KEGG pathways including 37 genes, and 12 hub 
genes step by step via the above biomedical databases. Finally, five hub genes 
(IL-6, VEGF-A, TP53, IL-1β, and transforming growth factor [TGF]-β1) and their 
specific interaction modes were identified, corresponding with 24 target drugs 
with therapeutic potential for AMD.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-6, VEGF-A, TP53, IL-1β, and TGF-β1 are pivotal in autophagy, 
cellular senescence, and the inflammatory response in AMD, corresponding with 24 
drugs with therapeutic potential for AMD, providing definite molecular 
mechanisms for further research and new possibilities for AMD treatment in the 
future.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: IL-6, VEGF-A, TP53, IL-1β, and TGF-β1 may be new 
targets for AMD gene therapy and drug development.

The Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb, www.dgidb.org) is a web resource that 
provides information on drug-gene interactions and druggable genes from 
publications, databases, and other web-based sources. Drug, gene, and 
interaction data are normalized and merged into conceptual groups. The 
information contained in this resource is available to users through a 
straightforward search interface, an application programming interface (API), 
and TSV data downloads. DGIdb 4.0 is the latest major version release of this 
database. A primary focus of this update was integration with crowdsourced 
efforts, leveraging the Drug Target Commons for community-contributed 
interaction data, Wikidata to facilitate term normalization, and export to NDEx 
for drug-gene interaction network representations. Seven new sources have been 
added since the last major version release, bringing the total number of sources 
included to 41. Of the previously aggregated sources, 15 have been updated. 
DGIdb 4.0 also includes improvements to the process of drug normalization and 
grouping of imported sources. Other notable updates include the introduction of 
a more sophisticated Query Score for interaction search results, an updated 
Interaction Score, the inclusion of interaction directionality, and several 
additional improvements to search features, data releases, licensing 
documentation and the application framework.

The prevalence of neutral mutations in cancer cell population impedes the 
distinguishing of cancer-causing driver mutations from passenger mutations. To 
systematically prioritize the oncogenic ability of somatic mutations and cancer 
genes, we constructed a useful platform, OncoVar (https://oncovar.org/), which 
employed published bioinformatics algorithms and incorporated known driver 
events to identify driver mutations and driver genes. We identified 20 162 
cancer driver mutations, 814 driver genes and 2360 pathogenic pathways with 
high-confidence by reanalyzing 10 769 exomes from 33 cancer types in The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 1942 genomes from 18 cancer types in International 
Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). OncoVar provides four points of view, 
'Mutation', 'Gene', 'Pathway' and 'Cancer', to help researchers to visualize the 
relationships between cancers and driver variants. Importantly, identification 
of actionable driver alterations provides promising druggable targets and 
repurposing opportunities of combinational therapies. OncoVar provides a 
user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading somatic driver 
mutations, driver genes and pathogenic pathways in various cancer types. This 
platform will facilitate the identification of cancer drivers across individual 
cancer cohorts and helps to rank mutations or genes for better decision-making 
among clinical oncologists, cancer researchers and the broad scientific 
community interested in cancer precision medicine.

To better understand host-virus genetic dependencies and find potential 
therapeutic targets for COVID-19, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR 
loss-of-function screen to identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 viral 
infection of human alveolar epithelial cells. Top-ranked genes cluster into 
distinct pathways, including the vacuolar ATPase proton pump, Retromer, and 
Commander complexes. We validate these gene targets using several orthogonal 
methods such as CRISPR knockout, RNA interference knockdown, and small-molecule 
inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify shared transcriptional 
changes in cholesterol biosynthesis upon loss of top-ranked genes. In addition, 
given the key role of the ACE2 receptor in the early stages of viral entry, we 
show that loss of RAB7A reduces viral entry by sequestering the ACE2 receptor 
inside cells. Overall, this work provides a genome-scale, quantitative resource 
of the impact of the loss of each host gene on fitness/response to viral 
infection.

BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common oral tumor 
globally. However, optimal therapeutic targets for OSCC have not been 
identified. This study aimed to identify the potential gene markers and 
available drugs for OSCC.
METHODS: Two transcriptional datasets containing OSCC gene expression data 
(GSE30784 and GSE23558) were selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. 
The interactive web tool GEO2R was then used to analyze the differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) analysis. A Venn diagram was used to integrate the DEGs 
screened out by the two microarrays. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network analysis of DEGs was performed using the Cytoscape, Database for 
Annotation, Visualization and Intergrated Discovery, and STRING databases. In 
addition to constructing the PPI networks among these DEGs, we chose several 
significant gene modules to conduct further gene-drug interaction analyses. 
Lastly, the existing drugs that target these module genes were selected to 
explore their therapeutic efficacy in treating OSCC.
RESULTS: A total of 199 DEGs were screened out by the two microarrays. They were 
found to be associated with several processes, including the epoxygenase P450 
pathway and the organelle membrane. The significant module genes in the PPI 
networks were CYP2E1, SCEL, KRT4, and KRT19. One existing drug, etoposide, which 
targets the CYP2E1 gene, was acquired.
CONCLUSIONS: Four potential biomarkers (CYP2E1, SCEL, KRT4, and KRT19) and one 
existing drug (etoposide) were obtained for gene expression prediction through a 
series of bioinformatics methods.

This paper was aimed to analyze the microRNA (miRNA) signatures in Alzheimer 
disease (AD) and find the significant expressions of miRNAs, their target genes, 
the functional enrichment analysis of the confirmed genes, and potential drug 
treatment. The miRNA expression information of the gene expression profile data 
was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The total data sample 
size is 1309, including 1021 AD samples and 288 normal samples. A total of 21 
differentially expressed miRNAs were obtained, of which 16 (hsa-miR-6761-3p, 
hsa-miR-6747-3p, hsa-miR-6875-3p, hsa-miR-6754-3p, hsa-miR-6736-3p, 
hsa-miR-6762-3p, hsa-miR-6787-3p, hsa-miR-208a-5p, hsa-miR-6740-3p, 
hsa-miR-6778-3p, hsa-miR-595, hsa-miR-6753-3p, hsa-miR-4747-3p, hsa-miR-3646, 
hsa-miR-6716-3p and hsa-miR-4435) were up-regulated and 5 (hsa-miR-125a-3p, 
hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-6131 and hsa-miR-125b-1-3p) were 
down-regulated in AD. A total of 6 miRNAs (hsa-miR-595, hsa-miR-3646, 
hsa-miR-4435 hsa-miR-125a-3p, hsa-miR-22-3p and hsa-miR-24-3p) and 78 
miRNA-disease-related gene sub-networks were predicted, and 116 ceRNA regulatory 
relationship pairs, and the ceRNA regulatory network were obtained. The results 
of enrichment analysis suggested that the main target pathways of several miRNAs 
differentially expressed in AD were mitogen-activated protein kinase signal 
pathway. According to the prediction results of Drug-Gene Interaction database 
2.0, we obtained 53 pairs of drug-gene interaction, including 7 genes (PTGS2, 
EGFR, CALM1, PDE4D, FGFR2, HMGCR, cdk6) and 53 drugs. We hope our results are 
helpful to find a viable way to prevent, delay the onset, diagnose, and treat 
AD.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a rhabdovirus reported to cause 
economic loss in fish farms. Because of the lack of adequate preventative 
treatments, the identification of multipath genes involved in VHS infection 
might be an alternative to explore the possibility of using drugs for the 
seasonal prevention of this fish disease. We propose labeling a category of drug 
molecules by further classification and interpretation of the Drug Gene 
Interaction Database using gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes enrichment scores. The study investigated disease networks of up-and 
down-regulated genes to find those with high interaction as substantial genes in 
pathways among the different disease networks. We prioritized these genes based 
on their relationship to those associated with VHS infection in the context of 
human protein-protein interaction networks and disease pathways. Among the 29 
genes as potential drug targets, nine were selected as promising druggable genes 
(ERBB2, FGFR3, ITGA2B, MAP2K1, NGF, NTRK1, PDGFRA, SCN2B, and SERPINC1). PDGFRA 
is the most important druggable up-and down-regulated gene and is considered an 
important gene in the IMATINIB pathway. This study findings indicate a promising 
approach for drug target prediction for VHS treatment, which might be useful for 
disease therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, 
numerous research institutions have invested in the development of anti-COVID-19 
vaccines and screening for efficacious drugs to manage the virus.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential targets and therapeutic drugs for the 
prevention and treatment of COVID-19 through data mining and bioinformatics.
METHODS: We integrated and profoundly analyzed 10 drugs previously assessed to 
have promising therapeutic potential in COVID-19 management, and have been 
recommended for clinical trials. To explore the mechanisms by which these drugs 
may be involved in the treatment of COVID-19, gene-drug interactions were 
identified using the DGIdb database after which functional enrichment analysis, 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and miRNA-gene network construction 
were performed. We adopted the DGIdb database to explore the candidate drugs for 
COVID-19.
RESULTS: A total of 43 genes associated with the 10 potential COVID-19 drugs 
were identified. Function enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were 
mainly enriched in response to other invasions, toll-like receptor pathways, and 
they play positive roles in the production of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and 
INF-β. TNF, TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, and CXCL10 were identified as crucial genes in 
COVID-19. Through the DGIdb database, we predicted 87 molecules as promising 
druggable molecules for managing COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this work may provide new insights into COVID-19 
mechanisms and treatments. Further, the already identified candidate drugs may 
improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical treatment in this rapidly evolving 
global situation.

Drug repurposing/repositioning, which aims to find novel indications for 
existing drugs, contributes to reducing the time and cost for drug development. 
For the recent decade, gene expression profiles of drug stimulating samples have 
been successfully used in drug repurposing. However, most of the existing 
methods neglect the gene modules and the interactions among the modules, 
although the cross-talks among pathways are common in drug response. It is 
essential to develop a method that utilizes the cross-talks information to 
predict the reliable candidate associations. In this study, we developed MNBDR 
(Module Network Based Drug Repositioning), a novel method that based on module 
network to screen drugs. It integrated protein-protein interactions and gene 
expression profile of human, to predict drug candidates for diseases. 
Specifically, the MNBDR mined dense modules through protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network and constructed a module network to reveal cross-talks among 
modules. Then, together with the module network, based on existing gene 
expression data set of drug stimulation samples and disease samples, we used 
random walk algorithms to capture essential modules in disease development and 
proposed a new indicator to screen potential drugs for a given disease. Results 
showed MNBDR could provide better performance than popular methods. Moreover, 
functional analysis of the essential modules in the network indicated our method 
could reveal biological mechanism in drug response.

Prevention of hyperlipidemia and associated diseases is a health priority. 
Natural products, such as the medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidum (Gl), have 
demonstrated hypocholesterolemic, prebiotic and antidiabetic properties. 
However, the underlying transcriptomic mechanisms by which Gl exerts 
bioactivities are not completely understood. We report a comprehensive hepatic 
and renal transcriptome profiling of C57BL/6 mice under the consumption of a 
high-cholesterol diet and two standardized Gl extracts obtained from 
basidiocarps cultivated on conventional substrate (Gl-1) or substrate containing 
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; Gl-2). We showed that Gl extracts modulate relevant 
metabolic pathways involving the restriction of lipid biosynthesis and the 
enrichment of lipid degradation and secretion. The Gl-2 extract exerts a major 
modulation over gene expression programs showing the highest similarity with 
simvastatin druggable-target-genes and these are enriched more in processes 
related to human obesity alterations in the liver. We further show a subset of 
Gl-modulated genes correlated with Lactobacillus enrichment and the reduction of 
circulating cholesterol-derived fats. Moreover, Gl extracts induce a significant 
decrease of macrophage lipid storage, which occurs concomitantly with the 
down-modulation of Fasn and Elovl6. Collectively, this evidence suggests a new 
link between Gl hypocholesterolemic and prebiotic activity, revealing thereby 
that standardized Mexican Gl extracts are a novel transcriptome modulator to 
prevent metabolic disorders associated with hypercholesterolemia.

Metastatic breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in 
women. Limited studies have been done on the genomic evolution between primary 
and metastatic breast cancer. We reconstructed the genomic evolution through the 
16-yr history of an ER+ HER2- breast cancer patient to investigate molecular 
mechanisms of disease relapse and treatment resistance after long-term exposure 
to hormonal therapy. Genomic and transcriptome profiling was performed on 
primary breast tumor (2002), initial recurrence (2012), and liver metastasis 
(2015) samples. Cell-free DNA analysis was performed at 11 time points 
(2015-2017). Mutational analysis revealed a low mutational burden in the primary 
tumor that doubled at the time of progression, with driver mutations in PI3K-Akt 
and RAS-RAF signaling pathways. Phylogenetic analysis showed an early branching 
off between primary tumor and metastasis. Liquid biopsies, although initially 
negative, started to detect an ESR1 E380Q mutation in 2016 with increasing 
allele frequency until the end of 2017. Transcriptome analysis revealed 721 (193 
up, 528 down) genes to be differentially expressed between primary tumor and 
first relapse. The most significantly down-regulated genes were TFF1 and PGR, 
indicating resistance to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. The most up-regulated 
genes included PTHLH, S100P, and SOX2, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. 
This phylogenetic reconstruction of the life history of a single patient's 
cancer as well as monitoring tumor progression through liquid biopsies allowed 
for uncovering the molecular mechanisms leading to initial relapse, metastatic 
spread, and treatment resistance.

The majority of the human genome encodes long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, 
critical regulators of various cellular processes, which largely outnumber 
protein-coding genes. However, lncRNA-involved fusions have not been surveyed 
and characterized yet. Here, we present a systematic study of the lncRNA fusion 
landscape across cancer types and identify >30 000 high-confidence 
tumor-specific lncRNA fusions (using 8284 tumor and 6946 normal samples). 
Fusions positively correlated with DNA damage and cancer stemness and were 
specifically low in microsatellite instable (MSI)-High or virus-infected tumors. 
Moreover, fusions distribute differently among cancer molecular subtypes, but 
with shared enrichment in tumors that are microsatellite stable (MSS), with high 
somatic copy number alterations (SCNA), and with poor survival. Importantly, we 
find a potentially new mechanism, mediated by enhancer RNAs (eRNA), which 
generates secondary fusions that form densely connected fusion networks with 
many fusion hubs targeted by FDA-approved drugs. Finally, we experimentally 
validate functions of two tumor-promoting chimeric proteins derived from 
mRNA-lncRNA fusions, KDM4B-G039927 and EPS15L1-lncOR7C2-1. The EPS15L1 fusion 
protein may regulate (Gasdermin E) GSDME, critical in pyroptosis and anti-tumor 
immunity. Our study completes the fusion landscape in cancers, sheds light on 
fusion mechanisms, and enriches lncRNA functions in tumorigenesis and cancer 
progression.

BACKGROUND: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is a complex disease associated 
with multiple molecular immunological mechanisms. As the underlying mechanism 
for VKH disease is unclear, we hope to utilize an integrated analysis of key 
pathways and drug targets to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: Candidate genes and proteins involved in VKH disease were identified 
through text-mining in the PubMed database. The GO and KEGG pathway analyses 
were used to examine the biological functions of the involved pathways 
associated with this disease. Molecule-related drugs were predicted through 
Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 48 genes and 54 proteins were associated with VKH disease. 
Forty-two significantly altered pathways were identified through pathway 
analysis and were mainly related to immune and inflammatory responses. The top 
five of significantly altered pathways were termed as "inflammatory bowel 
disease," "cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction," "allograft rejection," 
"antigen processing," and "presentation and Herpes simplex infection" in the 
KEGG database. IFN-γ and IL-6 were identified as the key genes through network 
analysis. The DGIdb analysis predicted 48 medicines as possible drugs for VKH 
disease, among which Interferon Alfa-2B was co-associated both with IFN-γ and 
IL-6.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, systematic analyses were utilized to detect key 
pathways and drug targets in VKH disease via bioinformatics analysis. IFN-γ and 
IL-6 were identified as the key mediators and possible drug targets in VKH 
disease. Interferon Alfa-2B was predicted to be a potentially effective drug for 
VKH disease treatment by targeting IFN-γ and IL-6, which warrants further 
experimental and clinical investigations.

Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, is facilitated 
by host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine 
protease 2 (TMPRSS2). We aimed to identify and characterize genes that are 
co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and to further explore their biological 
functions and potential as druggable targets. Using the gene expression profiles 
of 1,038 lung tissue samples, we performed a weighted gene correlation network 
analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of co-expressed genes. We explored the 
biology of co-expressed genes using bioinformatics databases, and identified 
known drug-gene interactions. ACE2 was in a module of 681 co-expressed genes; 10 
genes with moderate-high correlation with ACE2 (r > 0.3, FDR < 0.05) had known 
interactions with existing drug compounds. TMPRSS2 was in a module of 1,086 
co-expressed genes; 31 of these genes were enriched in the gene ontology 
biologic process 'receptor-mediated endocytosis', and 52 TMPRSS2-correlated 
genes had known interactions with drug compounds. Dozens of genes are 
co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, many of which have plausible links to 
COVID-19 pathophysiology. Many of the co-expressed genes are potentially 
targetable with existing drugs, which may accelerate the development of COVID-19 
therapeutics.

Refractory disease is a major challenge in treating patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML). Whereas the armamentarium has expanded in the past few years for 
treating AML, long-term survival outcomes have yet to be proven. To further 
expand the arsenal for treating AML, we searched for druggable gene targets in 
AML by analyzing screening data from a lentiviral-based genome-wide pooled 
CRISPR-Cas9 library and gene knockout (KO) dependency scores in 15 AML cell 
lines (HEL, MV411, OCIAML2, THP1, NOMO1, EOL1, KASUMI1, NB4, OCIAML3, MOLM13, 
TF1, U937, F36P, AML193, P31FUJ). Ninety-four gene KOs met the criteria of (A) 
specifically essential to AML cell survival, (B) non-essential in non-AML cells, 
and (C) druggable according to three-dimensional (3D) modeling or ligand-based 
druggability scoring. Forty-four of 94 gene-KOs (47%) had an already-approved 
drug match and comprised a drug development list termed "deKO." Fifty of 94 
gene-KOs (53%) had no drug in development and comprised a drug discovery list 
termed "disKO." STRING analysis and gene ontology categorization of the disKO 
targets preferentially cluster in the metabolic processes of UMP biosynthesis, 
IMP biosynthesis, dihydrofolate metabolism, pyrimidine nucleobase biosynthesis, 
vitellogenesis, and regulation of T cell differentiation and hematopoiesis. 
Results from this study serve as a testable compendium of AML drug targets that, 
after validation, may be translated into new therapeutics.

The thymic development of regulatory T (Treg) cells, crucial suppressors of the 
responses of effector T (Teff) cells, is governed by the transcription factor 
FOXP3. Despite the clinical importance of Treg cells, there is a dearth of 
druggable molecular targets capable of increasing their numbers in vivo. We 
found that inhibiting the function of the TRPM7 chanzyme (ion channel and 
enzyme) potentiated the thymic development of Treg cells in mice and led to a 
substantially higher frequency of functional Treg cells in the periphery. In 
addition, TRPM7-deficient mice were resistant to T cell-driven hepatitis. 
Deletion of Trpm7 and inhibition of TRPM7 channel activity by the FDA-approved 
drug FTY720 increased the sensitivity of T cells to the cytokine interleukin-2 
(IL-2) through a positive feed-forward loop involving increased expression of 
the IL-2 receptor α-subunit and activation of the transcriptional regulator 
STAT5. Enhanced IL-2 signaling increased the expression of Foxp3 in thymocytes 
and promoted thymic Treg (tTreg) cell development. Thus, these data indicate 
that inhibiting TRPM7 activity increases Treg cell numbers, suggesting that it 
may be a therapeutic target to promote immune tolerance.

PURPOSE: Microbiota-derived metabolites could alter the brain tissue toward the 
neurodegeneration disease. This study aims to select the genes associated with 
Propionic acid (PPA) and compromise Alzheimer's disease (AD) to find the 
possible roles of PPA in AD pathogenesis.
METHODS: Microbiota-derived metabolites could alter the brain tissue toward the 
neurodegeneration disease. This study aims to select the genes associated with 
Propionic acid (PPA) and compromise Alzheimer's disease (AD) to find the 
possible roles of PPA in AD pathogenesis.
RESULTS: Amongst all genes associated with PPA and AD, 284 genes to be shared by 
searching databases and were subjected to further analysis. AD-PPA genes mainly 
involved in cancer, bacterial and virus infection, and neurological and 
non-neurological diseases. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis covered the most 
AD hallmark, such as amyloid formation, apoptosis, proliferation, inflammation, 
and immune system. Network analysis revealed hub and bottleneck genes. MCODE 
analysis also indicated the seed genes represented in the significant 
subnetworks. ICAM1 and CCND1 were the hub, bottleneck, and seed genes.
CONCLUSIONS: PPA interacted genes implicated in AD act through pathways initiate 
neuronal cell death. In sum up, AD-PPA shared genes exhibited evidence that 
supports the idea PPA secreted from bacteria could alter brain physiology toward 
the emerging AD signs. This idea needs to confirm by more future investigation 
in animal models.

This study was to identify important circRNA-miRNA-mRNA (ceRNAs) regulatory 
mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The circRNA dataset GSE97332 and 
miRNA dataset GSE57555 were used for analyses. Functional enrichment analysis 
for miRNA and target gene was conducted using cluster Profiler. Survival 
analysis was conducted through R package Survival. The ceRNAs and drug-gene 
interaction networks were constructed. The ceRNAs network contained five miRNAs 
including hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-3692-5p, hsa-miR-4270, hsa-miR-331-3p, and 
hsa-miR-125a-3p. Among the network, hsa-miR-25-3p targeted the most genes, 
hsa-miR-3692-5p and hsa-miR-4270 were targeted by more circRNAs than other 
miRNAs, hsa-circ-0034326 and hsa-circ-0011950 interacted with three miRNAs. 
Furthermore, target genes, including NRAS, ITGA5, SLC7A1, SEC14L2, SLC12A5, and 
SMAD2 were obtained in drug-gene interaction network. Survival analysis showed 
NRAS, ITGA5, SLC7A1, SEC14L2, SLC12A5, and SMAD2 were significantly associated 
with prognosis of HCC. NRAS, ITGA5, and SMAD2 were significantly enriched in 
proteoglycans in cancer. Moreover, hsa-circ-0034326 and hsa-circ-0011950 might 
function as ceRNAs to play key roles in HCC. Furthermore, miR-25-3p, 
miR-3692-5p, and miR-4270 might be significant for HCC development. NRAS, ITGA5, 
SEC14L2, SLC12A5, and SMAD2 might be prognostic factors for HCC patients via 
proteoglycans in cancer pathway. Taken together, the findings will provide novel 
insight into pathogenesis, selection of therapeutic targets and prognostic 
factors for HCC.

We explored potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms regarding multiple 
benefits after bariatric surgery. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for 
subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) after bariatric surgery were identified by 
analyzing two expression profiles from the GEO. Subsequently, enrichment 
analysis, GSEA, PPI network, and gene-microRNAs and gene-TFs networks were 
interrogated to identify hub genes and associated pathways. Co-expressed DEGs 
included one that was up-regulated and 22 that were down-regulated genes. The 
enrichment analyses indicated that down-regulated DEGs were significantly 
involved in inflammatory responses. GSEA provided comprehensive evidence that 
most genes enriched in pro-inflammation pathways, while gene-sets after surgery 
enriched in metabolism. We identified nine hub genes in the PPI network, most of 
which were validated as highly expressed and hypomethylated in obesity by Attie 
Lab Diabetes and DiseaseMeth databases, respectively. DGIdb was also applied to 
predict potential therapeutic agents that might reverse abnormally high hub gene 
expression. Bariatric surgery induces a significant shift from an obese 
pro-inflammatory state to an anti-inflammatory state, with improvement in 
adipocyte metabolic function - representing key mechanisms whereby AT function 
improves after bariatric surgery. Our study deepens a mechanistic understanding 
of the benefits of bariatric surgery and provides potential biomarkers or 
treatment targets for further research.

PURPOSE: Inguinal hernia often occurs in elderly men, and more than one in five 
men will undergo inguinal hernia repair during their lifetime. Nevertheless, the 
underlying molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis behind hernia formation is 
still unclear. The aims in this study are finding out the potential gene markers 
and available drugs.
METHODS: Firstly, we re-analyzed the GSE92748 datasets, including four high and 
four low expressions of humanized aromatase transgenic mice, which refers to 
mimic humanized hernia, to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 
AromhumH group compared with AromhumL group by the criteria: fold change ≥ 1.4 
and adjust P value < 0.05. Secondly, the gene ontology and signaling pathway 
enrichment analyses of these DEGs were performed through online databases. In 
addition to the protein and protein interaction networks among these DEGs were 
constructed and the significant gene modules were chosen for further gene-drug 
interaction analysis. Lastly, the existing drugs target to these module genes 
were screen to explore the therapeutic effect for treatment of hernia.
RESULTS: We have identified 64 DEGs, which were associated with muscle system 
process, actomyosin structure organization etc. Moreover, the significant module 
genes in PPI networks were Cmya1, Casq2, Cmya5, Ttn, Csrp3 and Actc1, and one 
existing drug, DEXAMETHASONE, have targeted to Actc1 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: In the paper, we identified 6 potential genes and one existing drug 
for inguinal hernia, which might be used as targets and drugs for the study of 
inguinal hernia.

The drug discovery process starts with identification of a disease-modifying 
target. This critical step traditionally begins with manual investigation of 
scientific literature and biomedical databases to gather evidence linking 
molecular target to disease, and to evaluate the efficacy, safety and commercial 
potential of the target. The high-throughput and affordability of current omics 
technologies, allowing quantitative measurements of many putative targets (e.g. 
DNA, RNA, protein, metabolite), has exponentially increased the volume of 
scientific data available for this arduous task. Therefore, computational 
platforms identifying and ranking disease-relevant targets from existing 
biomedical data sources, including omics databases, are needed. To date, more 
than 30 drug target discovery (DTD) platforms exist. They provide 
information-rich databases and graphical user interfaces to help scientists 
identify putative targets and pre-evaluate their therapeutic efficacy and 
potential side effects. Here we survey and compare a set of popular DTD 
platforms that utilize multiple data sources and omics-driven knowledge bases 
(either directly or indirectly) for identifying drug targets. We also provide a 
description of omics technologies and related data repositories which are 
important for DTD tasks.

The integration of mass spectrometry-based proteomics with next-generation DNA 
and RNA sequencing profiles tumors more comprehensively. Here this 
"proteogenomics" approach was applied to 122 treatment-naive primary breast 
cancers accrued to preserve post-translational modifications, including protein 
phosphorylation and acetylation. Proteogenomics challenged standard breast 
cancer diagnoses, provided detailed analysis of the ERBB2 amplicon, defined 
tumor subsets that could benefit from immune checkpoint therapy, and allowed 
more accurate assessment of Rb status for prediction of CDK4/6 inhibitor 
responsiveness. Phosphoproteomics profiles uncovered novel associations between 
tumor suppressor loss and targetable kinases. Acetylproteome analysis 
highlighted acetylation on key nuclear proteins involved in the DNA damage 
response and revealed cross-talk between cytoplasmic and mitochondrial 
acetylation and metabolism. Our results underscore the potential of 
proteogenomics for clinical investigation of breast cancer through more accurate 
annotation of targetable pathways and biological features of this remarkably 
heterogeneous malignancy.

BACKGROUND: To this day, the molecular mechanism of endotoxin-induced 
multi-organ failure has not been completely clarified. This study aimed to 
construct an miRNA-mRNA regulatory network and identify main pathways and key 
genes in multi-organ of LPS-mediated endotoxemic mice.
METHODS: Public datasets from six mRNA and three miRNA microarray datasets were 
downloaded from the GEO website to screen final differentially expressed genes 
(FDEGs) and hub genes in the heart, lung, liver, and kidney of LPS-mediated 
endotoxemic mice. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis of FDEGs was used 
to identify the main pathways in multi-organ damage of LPS-treated mice. 
Finally, hub genes of each organ were intersected to obtain the key genes of 
multi-organ.
RESULTS: Firstly, 158, 358, 299, and 91 FDEGs were identified in the heart, 
lung, liver, and kidney, respectively. The pathway enrichment analysis of the 
FDEGs then showed that the TNF signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling 
pathway, and some viral-infection-related pathways (influenza A, measles, and 
herpes simplex) were the main pathways in multi-organ damage of LPS-mediated 
endotoxemic mice. Moreover, miRNA-mRNA or PPI regulatory networks were 
constructed based on FDEGs. According to these networks, 31, 34, 34, and 31 hub 
genes were identified in the heart, lung, liver, and kidney, respectively. Among 
them, nine key genes (Cd274, Cxcl1, Cxcl9, Icam1, Ifit2, Isg15, Stat1, Tlr2, and 
Usp18) were enriched in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and chemokine 
signaling pathway. Finally, seven potential drugs were predicted based on these 
key genes.
CONCLUSION: The shared underlying molecular pathways in endotoxin-induced 
multi-organ damage that have been identified include Toll-like receptor 
signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway. Besides, nine key genes (Cd274, 
Cxcl1, Cxcl9, Icam1, Ifit2, Isg15, Stat1, Tlr2, and Usp18) and seven potential 
drugs were identified. Our data provide a new sight and potential target for 
future therapy in endotoxemia-induced multi-organ failure.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic breast cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths 
in woman. Brain metastasis is a common and devastating site of relapse for 
several breast cancer molecular subtypes, including oestrogen receptor-positive 
disease, with life expectancy of less than a year. While efforts have been 
devoted to developing therapeutics for extra-cranial metastasis, drug 
penetration of blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major clinical challenge. 
Defining molecular alterations in breast cancer brain metastasis enables the 
identification of novel actionable targets.
METHODS: Global transcriptomic analysis of matched primary and metastatic 
patient tumours (n = 35 patients, 70 tumour samples) identified a putative new 
actionable target for advanced breast cancer which was further validated in vivo 
and in breast cancer patient tumour tissue (n = 843 patients). A peptide mimetic 
of the target's natural ligand was designed in silico and its efficacy assessed 
in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models of breast cancer metastasis.
RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of over-represented pathways in metastatic 
breast cancer identified ADAM22 as a top ranked member of the ECM-related 
druggable genome specific to brain metastases. ADAM22 was validated as an 
actionable target in in vitro, ex vivo and in patient tumour tissue (n = 843 
patients). A peptide mimetic of the ADAM22 ligand LGI1, LGI1MIM, was designed in 
silico. The efficacy of LGI1MIM and its ability to penetrate the BBB were 
assessed in vitro, ex vivo and in brain metastasis BBB 3D biometric biohybrid 
models, respectively. Treatment with LGI1MIM in vivo inhibited disease 
progression, in particular the development of brain metastasis.
CONCLUSION: ADAM22 expression in advanced breast cancer supports development of 
breast cancer brain metastasis. Targeting ADAM22 with a peptide mimetic LGI1MIM 
represents a new therapeutic option to treat metastatic brain disease.

Introduction: We introduce in this study CovMulNet19, a comprehensive COVID-19 
network containing all available known interactions involving SARS-CoV-2 
proteins, interacting-human proteins, diseases and symptoms that are related to 
these human proteins, and compounds that can potentially target them. Materials 
and Methods: Extensive network analysis methods, based on a bootstrap approach, 
allow us to prioritize a list of diseases that display a high similarity to 
COVID-19 and a list of drugs that could potentially be beneficial to treat 
patients. As a key feature of CovMulNet19, the inclusion of symptoms allows a 
deeper characterization of the disease pathology, representing a useful proxy 
for COVID-19-related molecular processes. Results: We recapitulate many of the 
known symptoms of the disease and we find the most similar diseases to COVID-19 
reflect conditions that are risk factors in patients. In particular, the 
comparison between CovMulNet19 and randomized networks recovers many of the 
known associated comorbidities that are important risk factors for COVID-19 
patients, through identified similarities with intestinal, hepatic, and 
neurological diseases as well as with respiratory conditions, in line with 
reported comorbidities. Conclusion: CovMulNet19 can be suitably used for network 
medicine analysis, as a valuable tool for exploring drug repurposing while 
accounting for the intervening multidimensional factors, from molecular 
interactions to symptoms.

Though promising, identifying synergistic combinations from a large pool of 
candidate drugs remains challenging for cancer treatment. Due to unclear 
mechanism and limited confirmed cases, only a few computational algorithms are 
able to predict drug synergy. Yet they normally require the drug-cell treatment 
results as an essential input, thus exclude the possibility to pre-screen those 
unexplored drugs without cell treatment profiling. Based on the largest dataset 
of 33,574 combinational scenarios, we proposed a handy webserver, H-RACS, to 
overcome the above problems. Being loaded with chemical structures and target 
information, H-RACS can recommend potential synergistic pairs between candidate 
drugs on 928 cell lines of 24 prevalent cancer types. A high model performance 
was achieved with AUC of 0.89 on independent combinational scenarios. On the 
second independent validation of DREAM dataset, H-RACS obtained precision of 67% 
among its top 5% ranking list. When being tested on new combinations and new 
cell lines, H-RACS showed strong extendibility with AUC of 0.84 and 0.81 
respectively. As the first online server freely accessible at 
http://www.badd-cao.net/h-racs, H-RACS may promote the pre-screening of 
synergistic combinations for new chemical drugs on unexplored cancers.

Viruses co-opt host proteins to carry out their lifecycle. Repurposed host 
proteins may thus become functionally compromised; a situation analogous to a 
loss-of-function mutation. We term such host proteins viral-induced hypomorphs. 
Cells bearing cancer driver loss-of-function mutations have successfully been 
targeted with drugs perturbing proteins encoded by the synthetic lethal partners 
of cancer-specific mutations. Synthetic lethal interactions of viral-induced 
hypomorphs have the potential to be similarly targeted for the development of 
host-based antiviral therapeutics. Here, we use GBF1, which supports the 
infection of many RNA viruses, as a proof-of-concept. GBF1 becomes a hypomorph 
upon interaction with the poliovirus protein 3A. Screening for synthetic lethal 
partners of GBF1 revealed ARF1 as the top hit, disruption of which, selectively 
killed cells that synthesize poliovirus 3A. Thus, viral protein interactions can 
induce hypomorphs that render host cells vulnerable to perturbations that leave 
uninfected cells intact. Exploiting viral-induced vulnerabilities could lead to 
broad-spectrum antivirals for many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
SUMMARY: Using a viral-induced hypomorph of GBF1, Navare et al., demonstrate 
that the principle of synthetic lethality is a mechanism to selectively kill 
virus-infected cells.

Cellular signaling systems play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis when a 
cell is exposed to different perturbations. Components of the systems are 
organized as hierarchical networks, and perturbing different components often 
leads to transcriptomic profiles that exhibit compositional statistical 
patterns. Mining such patterns to investigate how cellular signals are encoded 
is an important problem in systems biology, where artificial intelligence 
techniques can be of great assistance. Here, we investigated the capability of 
deep generative models (DGMs) to modeling signaling systems and learn 
representations of cellular states underlying transcriptomic responses to 
diverse perturbations. Specifically, we show that the variational autoencoder 
and the supervised vector-quantized variational autoencoder can accurately 
regenerate gene expression data in response to perturbagen treatments. The 
models can learn representations that reveal the relationships between different 
classes of perturbagens and enable mappings between drugs and their target 
genes. In summary, DGMs can adequately learn and depict how cellular signals are 
encoded. The resulting representations have broad applications, demonstrating 
the power of artificial intelligence in systems biology and precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: Patients with glioblastoma (GBM) have a dismal prognosis, and there 
is an unmet need for new therapeutic options. This study aims to identify new 
therapeutic targets in GBM.
METHODS: mRNA expression data of patient-derived GBM (n = 1279) and normal brain 
tissue (n = 46) samples were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus and The 
Cancer Genome Atlas. Functional genomic mRNA profiling was applied to capture 
the downstream effects of genomic alterations on gene expression levels. Next, a 
class comparison between GBM and normal brain tissue was performed. 
Significantly upregulated genes in GBM were further prioritized based on (1) 
known interactions with antineoplastic drugs, (2) current drug development 
status in humans, and (3) association with biologic pathways known to be 
involved in GBM. Antineoplastic agents against prioritized targets were 
validated in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We identified 712 significantly upregulated genes in GBM compared to 
normal brain tissue, of which 27 have a known interaction with antineoplastic 
agents. Seventeen of the 27 genes, including EGFR and VEGFA, have been 
clinically evaluated in GBM with limited efficacy. For the remaining 10 genes, 
RRM2, MAPK9 (JNK2, SAPK1a), and XIAP play a role in GBM development. We 
demonstrated for the MAPK9 inhibitor RGB-286638 a viability loss in multiple GBM 
cell culture models. Although no overall survival benefit was observed in vivo, 
there were indications that RGB-286638 may delay tumor growth.
CONCLUSIONS: The MAPK9 inhibitor RGB-286638 showed promising in vitro results. 
Furthermore, in vivo target engagement studies and combination therapies with 
this compound warrant further exploration.

Meningioma are the most frequent primary intracranial tumour. Management of 
aggressive meningioma is complex, and development of effective biomarkers or 
pharmacological interventions is hampered by an incomplete knowledge of 
molecular landscape. Here, we present an integrated analysis of two 
complementary omics studies to investigate alterations in the 
"transcriptome-proteome" profile of high-grade (III) compared to low-grade (I) 
meningiomas. We identified 3598 common transcripts/proteins and revealed 
concordant up- and downregulation in grade III vs. grade I meningiomas. 
Concordantly upregulated genes included FABP7, a fatty acid binding protein and 
the monoamine oxidase MAOB, the latter of which we validated at the protein 
level and established an association with Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)-approved drugs. Notably, we derived a plasma signature of 21 discordantly 
expressed genes showing positive changes in protein but negative in transcript 
levels of high-grade meningiomas, including the validated genes CST3, LAMP2, 
PACS1 and HTRA1, suggesting the acquisition of these proteins by tumour from 
plasma. Aggressive meningiomas were enriched in processes such as oxidative 
phosphorylation and RNA metabolism, whilst concordantly downregulated genes were 
related to reduced cellular adhesion. Overall, our study provides the first 
transcriptome-proteome characterisation of meningioma, identifying several novel 
and previously described transcripts/proteins with potential grade III biomarker 
and therapeutic significance.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths worldwide and 
has become an urgent public health concern. The extraordinary interhuman 
transmission of this disease has urged scientists to examine the various facets 
of its pathogenic agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2). Herein, based on publicly available genomic data, we analyzed the 
codon usage co-adaptation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory 
coronaviruses (CoVs) with their human host, identified CoV-responsive human 
genes and their functional roles on the basis of both the relative synonymous 
codon usage (RSCU)-based correlation of viral genes with human genes and 
differential gene expression analysis, and predicted potential drugs for 
COVID-19 treatment based on these genes. The relatively high codon adaptation 
index (CAI) values (>0.70) signposted the gene expressivity efficiency of CoVs 
in human. The ENc-GC3 plot indicated that SARS-CoV-2 genome was under strict 
selection pressure while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were under selection and 
mutational pressures. The RSCU-based correlation analysis indicated that the 
viral genomes shared similar codons with a panoply of human genes. The merging 
of RSCU-based correlation data and SARS-CoV-2-responsive differentially 
expressed genes allowed the identification of human genes potentially affected 
by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these 
genes were enriched in biological processes and pathways related to host 
response to viral infection and immune response. Using the drug-gene interaction 
database, we screened a list of drugs that could target these genes as potential 
COVID-19 therapeutics. Our findings not only will contribute in vaccine 
development but also provide a useful set of drugs that could guide 
practitioners in strategical monitoring of COVID-19. We recommend practitioners 
to scrupulously screen this list of predicted drugs in order to authenticate 
those qualified for treating COVID-19 symptoms.

Following two decades of more than 400 clinical trials centered on the "one 
drug, one target, one disease" paradigm, there is still no effective 
disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inherent complexity 
of AD may challenge this reductionist strategy. Recent observations and advances 
in network medicine further indicate that AD likely shares common underlying 
mechanisms and intermediate pathophenotypes, or endophenotypes, with other 
diseases. In this review, we consider AD pathobiology, disease comorbidity, 
pleiotropy, and therapeutic development, and construct relevant endophenotype 
networks to guide future therapeutic development. Specifically, we discuss six 
main endophenotype hypotheses in AD: amyloidosis, tauopathy, neuroinflammation, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, vascular dysfunction, and lysosomal dysfunction. We 
further consider how this endophenotype network framework can provide advances 
in computational and experimental strategies for drug-repurposing and 
identification of new candidate therapeutic strategies for patients suffering 
from or at risk for AD. We highlight new opportunities for 
endophenotype-informed, drug discovery in AD, by exploiting multi-omics data. 
Integration of genomics, transcriptomics, radiomics, pharmacogenomics, and 
interactomics (protein-protein interactions) are essential for successful drug 
discovery. We describe experimental technologies for AD drug discovery including 
human induced pluripotent stem cells, transgenic mouse/rat models, and 
population-based retrospective case-control studies that may be integrated with 
multi-omics in a network medicine methodology. In summary, endophenotype-based 
network medicine methodologies will promote AD therapeutic development that will 
optimize the usefulness of available data and support deep phenotyping of the 
patient heterogeneity for personalized medicine in AD.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most common forms of 
substance use disorders with a strong contribution of genetic (50%-60%) and 
environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a 
number of AUD-associated variants, including those in alcohol metabolism genes. 
These genetic variants may modulate gene expression, making individuals more 
susceptible to AUD. A long-term alcohol consumption can also change the 
transcriptome patterns of subjects via epigenetic modulations.
METHODS: To explore the interactive effect of genetic and epigenetic factors on 
AUD, we conducted a secondary analysis by integrating GWAS, CNV, brain 
transcriptome and DNA methylation data to unravel novel AUD-associated 
genes/variants. We applied the mega-analysis of OR (MegaOR) method to prioritise 
AUD candidate genes (AUDgenes).
RESULTS: We identified a consensus set of 206 AUDgenes based on the multi-omics 
data. We demonstrated that these AUDgenes tend to interact with each other more 
frequent than chance expectation. Functional annotation analysis indicated that 
these AUDgenes were involved in substance dependence, synaptic transmission, 
glial cell proliferation and enriched in neuronal and liver cells. We obtained a 
multidimensional evidence that AUD is a polygenic disorder influenced by both 
genetic and epigenetic factors as well as the interaction of them.
CONCLUSION: We characterised multidimensional evidence of genetic, epigenetic 
and transcriptomic data in AUD. We found that 206 AUD associated genes were 
highly expressed in liver, brain cerebellum, frontal cortex, hippocampus and 
pituitary. Our studies provides important insights into the molecular mechanism 
of AUD and potential target genes for AUD treatment.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ( ACE2 ) receptor has been identified as the key 
adhesion molecule for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. However, there is no 
evidence that human genetic variation in ACE2 is singularly responsible for 
COVID-19 susceptibility. Therefore, we performed a multi-level characterization 
of genes that interact with ACE2 (ACE2-gene network) for their over-represented 
biological properties in the context of COVID-19. The phenome-wide association 
of 51 genes including ACE2 with 4,756 traits categorized into 26 phenotype 
categories, showed enrichment of immunological, respiratory, environmental, 
skeletal, dermatological, and metabolic domains (p<4e-4). Transcriptomic 
regulation of ACE2-gene network was enriched for tissue-specificity in kidney, 
small intestine, and colon (p<4.7e-4). Leveraging the drug-gene interaction 
database we identified 47 drugs, including dexamethasone and spironolactone, 
among others. Considering genetic variants within ± 10 kb of ACE2-network genes 
we characterized functional consequences (among others) using miRNA binding-site 
targets. MiRNAs affected by ACE2-network variants revealed statistical 
over-representation of inflammation, aging, diabetes, and heart conditions. With 
respect to variants mapped to the ACE2-network, we observed COVID-19 related 
associations in RORA, SLC12A6 and SLC6A19 genes. Overall, functional 
characterization of ACE2-gene network highlights several potential mechanisms in 
COVID-19 susceptibility. The data can also be accessed at

BACKGROUND: The T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment, characterized by CD8 T 
cells and type I/II interferon transcripts, is an important cancer immunotherapy 
biomarker. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) may also dictate response, and some 
oncogenes (i.e., WNT/β-catenin) are known to mediate immunosuppression.
METHODS: We performed an integrated multi-omic analysis of human cancer 
including 11,607 tumors across multiple databases and patients treated with 
anti-PD1. After adjusting for TMB, we correlated the T cell-inflamed gene 
expression signature with somatic mutations, transcriptional programs, and 
relevant proteome for different immune phenotypes, by tumor type and across 
cancers.
RESULTS: Strong correlations were noted between mutations in oncogenes and tumor 
suppressor genes and non-T cell-inflamed tumors with examples including IDH1 and 
GNAQ as well as less well-known genes including KDM6A, CD11c, and genes with 
unknown functions. Conversely, we observe genes associating with the T 
cell-inflamed phenotype including VHL and PBRM1. Analyzing gene expression 
patterns, we identify oncogenic mediators of immune exclusion across cancer 
types (HIF1A and MYC) as well as novel examples in specific tumors such as sonic 
hedgehog signaling, hormone signaling and transcription factors. Using network 
analysis, somatic and transcriptomic events were integrated. In contrast to 
previous reports of individual tumor types such as melanoma, integrative 
pan-cancer analysis demonstrates that most non-T cell-inflamed tumors are 
influenced by multiple signaling pathways and that increasing numbers of 
co-activated pathways leads to more highly non-T cell-inflamed tumors. 
Validating these analyses, we observe highly consistent inverse relationships 
between pathway protein levels and the T cell-inflamed gene expression across 
cancers. Finally, we integrate available databases for drugs that might overcome 
or augment the identified mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: These results nominate molecular targets and drugs potentially 
available for further study and potential immediate translation into clinical 
trials for patients with cancer.

Background: Epidemiological research has reported that attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia 
(SCZ), and unipolar depression (UD) are multimorbid conditions that are 
typically accompanied by cognitive advantages or deficits, suggesting that 
common biological mechanisms may underlie these phenotypes. Genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) associated with psychiatric disorders and cognitive functioning. However, 
the mechanisms by which these SNPs contribute to multimorbidities amongst 
psychiatric and cognitive phenotypes remains largely unknown. Objective: To 
identify shared regulatory mechanisms amongst multimorbid psychiatric disorders 
and cognitive functioning. Methods: We integrated data on 3D genome 
organization, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and pathway analyses 
to identify shared and specific regulatory impacts of 2,893 GWAS SNPs (p < 1 × 
10-6) associated with ADHD, anxiety, BD, SCZ, UD, and cognitive functioning on 
genes and biological pathways. Drug-gene interaction analysis was performed to 
identify potential pharmacological impacts on these genes and pathways. Results: 
The analysis revealed 33 genes and 62 pathways that were commonly affected by 
tissue-specific gene regulatory interactions associated with all six phenotypes 
despite there being no common SNPs in our original dataset. The analysis of 
brain-specific regulatory connections revealed similar patterns at eQTL and 
eGene levels, but no pathways shared by all six phenotypes. Instead, pairwise 
overlaps and individualized pathways were identified for psychiatric and 
cognitive phenotypes in brain tissues. Conclusions: This study offers insight 
into the shared genes and biological pathways that are affected by 
tissue-specific regulatory impacts resulting from psychiatric- and 
cognition-associated genetic variants. These results provide limited support for 
the "p-factor" hypothesis for psychiatric disorders and potential mechanisms 
that explain drug side-effects. Our results highlight key biological pathways 
for development of therapies that target single or multiple psychiatric and 
cognitive phenotypes.

We propose a new plausible mechanism by mean of which SARS-CoV-2 produces 
extrapulmonary damages in severe COVID-19 patients. The mechanism consist on the 
existence of vulnerable proteins (VPs), which are (i) mainly expressed outside 
the lungs; (ii) their perturbations is known to produce human diseases; and 
(iii) can be perturbed directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These VPs 
are perturbed by other proteins, which are: (i) mainly expressed in the lungs, 
(ii) are targeted directly by SARS-CoV-2 proteins, (iii) can navigate outside 
the lungs as cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs); and (iv) can activate VPs 
via subdiffusive processes inside the target organ. Using bioinformatic tools 
and mathematical modeling we identifies 26 VPs and their 38 perturbators, which 
predict extracellular damages in the immunologic endocrine, cardiovascular, 
circulatory, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, neurologic, dermatologic, hepatic, 
gastrointestinal, and metabolic systems, as well as in the eyes. The 
identification of these VPs and their perturbators allow us to identify 27 
existing drugs which are candidates to be repurposed for treating extrapulmonary 
damage in severe COVID-19 patients. After removal of drugs having undesirable 
drug-drug interactions we select 7 drugs and one natural product: apabetalone, 
romidepsin, silmitasertib, ozanezumab, procaine, azacitidine, amlexanox, 
volociximab, and ellagic acid, whose combinations can palliate the organs and 
systems found to be damaged by COVID-19. We found that at least 4 drugs are 
needed to treat all the multiorgan damages, for instance: the combination of 
romidepsin, silmitasertib, apabetalone and azacitidine.

Cardiovascular dysfunction is one of the most common complications of long-term 
cancer treatment. Growing evidence has shown that antineoplastic drugs can 
increase cardiovascular risk during cancer therapy, seriously affecting patient 
survival. However, little is known about the genetic factors associated with the 
cardiovascular risk of antineoplastic drugs. We established a compendium of 
genetic evidence that supports cardiovascular risk induced by antineoplastic 
drugs. Most of this genetic evidence is attributed to causal alleles altering 
the expression of cardiovascular disease genes. We found that antineoplastic 
drugs predicted to induce cardiovascular risk are significantly enriched in 
drugs associated with cardiovascular adverse reactions, including many 
first-line cancer treatments. Functional experiments validated that retinoid X 
receptor agonists can reduce triglyceride lipolysis, thus modulating 
cardiovascular risk. Our results establish a link between the causal allele of 
cardiovascular disease genes and the direction of pharmacological modulation, 
which could facilitate cancer drug discovery and clinical trial design.

Breast cancer is a disease of genomic alterations, of which the panorama of 
somatic mutations and how these relate to subtypes and therapy response is 
incompletely understood. Within SCAN-B (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02306096), a 
prospective study elucidating the transcriptomic profiles for thousands of 
breast cancers, we developed a RNA-seq pipeline for detection of SNVs/indels and 
profiled a real-world cohort of 3,217 breast tumors. We describe the mutational 
landscape of primary breast cancer viewed through the transcriptome of a large 
population-based cohort and relate it to patient survival. We demonstrate that 
RNA-seq can be used to call mutations in genes such as PIK3CA, TP53, and ERBB2, 
as well as the status of molecular pathways and mutational burden, and identify 
potentially druggable mutations in 86.8% of tumors. To make this rich dataset 
available for the research community, we developed an open source web 
application, the SCAN-B MutationExplorer 
(http://oncogenomics.bmc.lu.se/MutationExplorer). These results add another 
dimension to the use of RNA-seq as a clinical tool, where both gene expression- 
and mutation-based biomarkers can be interrogated in real-time within 1 week of 
tumor sampling.

Immune-modulating therapies have revolutionized the treatment of chronic 
diseases, particularly cancer. However, their success is restricted and there is 
a need to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we show that natural killer 
cell granule protein 7 (NKG7) is a regulator of lymphocyte granule exocytosis 
and downstream inflammation in a broad range of diseases. NKG7 expressed by CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells played key roles in promoting inflammation during visceral 
leishmaniasis and malaria-two important parasitic diseases. Additionally, NKG7 
expressed by natural killer cells was critical for controlling cancer 
initiation, growth and metastasis. NKG7 function in natural killer and CD8+ T 
cells was linked with their ability to regulate the translocation of CD107a to 
the cell surface and kill cellular targets, while NKG7 also had a major impact 
on CD4+ T cell activation following infection. Thus, we report a novel 
therapeutic target expressed on a range of immune cells with functions in 
different immune responses.

This study aimed to explore key regulatory connections underlying lung 
transplant rejection. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 
rejection and stable lung transplantation (LTx) samples were screened using R 
package limma, followed by functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein 
interaction network construction. Subsequently, a global triple network, 
including miRNAs, mRNAs, and transcription factors (TFs), was constructed. 
Furthermore, immune cell infiltration characteristics were analyzed to 
investigate the molecular immunology of lung transplant rejection. Finally, 
potential drug-target interactions were generated. In brief, 739 DEGs were found 
between rejection and stable LTx samples. PTPRC, IL-6, ITGAM, CD86, TLR8, 
TYROBP, CXCL10, ITGB2, and CCR5 were defined as hub genes. Eight TFs, including 
STAT1, SPIB, NFKB1, SPI1, STAT5A, RUNX1, VENTX, and BATF, and five miRNAs, 
including miR-335-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-124-3p, miR-1-3p, and miR-155-5p, were 
involved in regulating hub genes. The immune cell infiltration analysis revealed 
higher proportions of activated memory CD4 T cells, follicular helper T cells, 
γδ T cells, monocytes, M1 and M2 macrophages, and eosinophils in rejection 
samples, besides lower proportions of resting memory CD4 T cells, regulatory T 
cells, activated NK cells, M0 macrophages, and resting mast cells. This study 
provided a comprehensive perspective of the molecular co-regulatory network 
underlying lung transplant rejection.

Ex vivo evaluation of personalized models can facilitate individualized 
treatment selection for patients, and advance the discovery of novel therapeutic 
options. However, for embryonal malignancies, representative primary cultures 
have been difficult to establish. We developed patient-derived cell cultures 
(PDCs) from chemo-naïve and post-treatment neuroblastoma tumors in a consistent 
and efficient manner, and characterized their in vitro growth dynamics, 
histomorphology, gene expression, and functional chemo-response. From 34 
neuroblastoma tumors, 22 engrafted in vitro to generate 31 individual PDC lines, 
with higher engraftment seen with metastatic tumors. PDCs displayed 
characteristic immunohistochemical staining patterns of PHOX2B, TH, and GD2 
synthase. Concordance of MYCN amplification, 1p and 11q deletion between PDCs 
and patient tumors was 83.3%, 72.7%, and 80.0% respectively. PDCs displayed a 
predominantly mesenchymal-type gene expression signature and showed upregulation 
of pro-angiogenic factors that were similarly enriched in culture medium and 
paired patient serum samples. When tested with standard-of-care cytotoxics at 
human Cmax -equivalent concentrations, MYCN-amplified and non-MYCN-amplified 
PDCs showed a differential response to cyclophosphamide and topotecan, which 
mirrored the corresponding patients' responses, and correlated with gene 
signatures of chemosensitivity. In this translational proof-of-concept study, 
early-phase neuroblastoma PDCs enriched for the mesenchymal cell subpopulation 
recapitulated the individual molecular and phenotypic profile of patient tumors, 
and highlighted their potential as a platform for individualized ex vivo 
drug-response testing.

BACKGROUND: Drug repurposing enables the discovery of potential cancer 
treatments using publically available data from over 4000 published Food and 
Drug Administration approved and experimental drugs. However, the ability to 
effectively evaluate the drug's efficacy remains a challenge. Impediments to 
broad applicability include inaccuracies in many of the computational 
drug-target algorithms and a lack of clinically relevant biologic modeling 
systems to validate the computational data for subsequent translation.
METHODS: We have integrated our computational proteochemometric systems network 
pharmacology platform, DrugGenEx-Net, with primary, continuous cultures of 
conditionally reprogrammed (CR) normal and prostate cancer (PCa) cells derived 
from treatment-naive patients with primary PCa.
RESULTS: Using the transcriptomic data from two matched pairs of benign and 
tumor-derived CR cells, we constructed drug networks to describe the biological 
perturbation associated with each prostate cell subtype at multiple levels of 
biological action. We prioritized the drugs by analyzing these networks for 
statistical coincidence with the drug action networks originating from known and 
predicted drug-protein targets. Prioritized drugs shared between the two 
patients' PCa cells included carfilzomib (CFZ), bortezomib (BTZ), sulforaphane, 
and phenethyl isothiocyanate. The effects of these compounds were then tested in 
the CR cells, in vitro. We observed that the IC50 values of the normal PCa CR 
cells for CFZ and BTZ were higher than their matched tumor CR cells. 
Transcriptomic analysis of CFZ-treated CR cells revealed that genes involved in 
cell proliferation, proteases, and downstream targets of serine proteases were 
inhibited while KLK7 and KLK8 were induced in the tumor-derived CR cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Given that the drugs in the database are extremely 
well-characterized and that the patient-derived cells are easily scalable for 
high throughput drug screening, this combined in vitro and in silico approach 
may significantly advance personalized PCa treatment and for other cancer 
applications.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects cells of the airway and lungs in humans causing the 
disease COVID-19. This disease is characterized by cough, shortness of breath, 
and in severe cases causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) which can be fatal. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma 
from mild and severe cases of COVID-19 have been profiled using protein 
measurements and bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Onset of pneumonia and 
ARDS can be rapid in COVID-19, suggesting a potential neuronal involvement in 
pathology and mortality. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives 
changes in immune cell-derived factors that then interact with receptors 
expressed by the sensory neuronal innervation of the lung to further promote 
important aspects of disease severity, including ARDS. We sought to quantify how 
immune cells might interact with sensory innervation of the lung in COVID-19 
using published data from patients, existing RNA sequencing datasets from human 
dorsal root ganglion neurons and other sources, and a genome-wide 
ligand-receptor pair database curated for pharmacological interactions relevant 
for neuro-immune interactions. Our findings reveal a landscape of 
ligand-receptor interactions in the lung caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection 
and point to potential interventions to reduce the burden of neurogenic 
inflammation in COVID-19 pulmonary disease. In particular, our work highlights 
opportunities for clinical trials with existing or under development rheumatoid 
arthritis and other (e.g. CCL2, CCR5 or EGFR inhibitors) drugs to treat high 
risk or severe COVID-19 cases.

AIMS: To investigate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and molecular 
interaction in unstable atherosclerotic carotid plaques.
METHODS: Gene expression datasets GSE41571, GSE118481, and E-MTAB-2055 were 
analyzed. Co-regulated DEGs in at least two datasets were analyzed with the 
enrichment of Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO-BP), Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG), protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, 
interrelationships between miRNAs/transcriptional factors, and their target 
genes and drug-gene interactions. The expression of notable DEGs in human 
carotid artery plaques and plasma was further identified.
RESULTS: The GO-BP enrichment analysis revealed that genes associated with 
inflammatory response, and extracellular matrix organization were altered. The 
KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that upregulated DEGs were enriched in the 
tuberculous, lysosomal, and chemokine signaling pathways, whereas downregulated 
genes were enriched in the focal adhesion and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. 
Collagen type I alpha 2 chain (COL1A2), adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3), C-X-C motif 
chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), and TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein 
(TYROBP) might play crucial roles in the PPI networks. In drug-gene 
interactions, colonystimulating factor-1 receptor had the most drug 
interactions. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) was markedly 
downregulated in unstable human carotid plaques and plasma. Under a receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis, plasma IGFBP6 had a significant 
discriminatory power (AUC, 0.894; 95% CI, 0.810-0.977), with a cutoff value of 
142.08 ng/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: The genes COL1A2, ADCY3, CXCR4, and TYROBP are promising targets 
for the prevention of unstable carotid plaque formation. IGFBP6 may be an 
important biomarker for predicting vulnerable plaques.

During these days of global emergency for the COVID-19 disease outbreak, there 
is an urgency to share reliable information able to help worldwide life 
scientists to get better insights and make sense of the large amount of data 
currently available. In this study we used the results presented in [1] to 
perform two different Systems Biology analyses on the HCoV-host interactome. In 
the first one, we reconstructed the interactome of the HCoV-host proteins, 
integrating it with highly reliable miRNA and drug interactions information. We 
then added the IL-6 gene, identified in recent publications [2] as heavily 
involved in the COVID-19 progression and, interestingly, we identified several 
interactions with the reconstructed interactome. In the second analysis, we 
performed a Gene Ontology and a Pathways enrichment analysis on the full set of 
the HCoV-host interactome proteins and on the ones belonging to a significantly 
dense cluster of interacting proteins identified in the first analysis. Results 
of the two analyses provide a compact but comprehensive glance on some of the 
current state-of-the-art regulations, GO, and pathways involved in the HCoV-host 
interactome, and that could support all scientists currently focusing on 
SARS-CoV-2 research.

Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors among women worldwide 
and has a high morbidity and mortality. This research aimed to identify hub 
genes and small molecule drugs for breast cancer by integrated bioinformatics 
analysis. After downloading multiple gene expression datasets from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, 283 overlapping 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) significantly enriched in different 
cancer-related functions and pathways were obtained using LIMMA, VennDiagram and 
ClusterProfiler packages of R. We then analyzed the topology of protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network with overlapping DEGs and further obtained six hub 
genes (RRM2, CDC20, CCNB2, BUB1B, CDK1, and CCNA2) from the network via STRING 
and Cytoscape. Subsequently, we conducted genes expression verification, genetic 
alterations evaluation, immune infiltration prediction, clinicopathological 
parameters analysis, identification of transcriptional and post-transcriptional 
regulatory molecules, and survival analysis for these hub genes. Meanwhile, 29 
possible drug candidates (e.g., Cladribine, Gallium nitrate, Alvocidib, 
1β-hydroxyalantolactone, Berberine hydrochloride, Nitidine chloride) were 
identified from the DGIdb database and the GSE85871 dataset. In addition, some 
transcription factors and miRNAs (e.g., E2F1, PTTG1, TP53, ZBTB16, 
hsa-miR-130a-3p, hsa-miR-204-5p) targeting hub genes were identified as key 
regulators in the progression of breast cancer. In conclusion, our study 
identified six hub genes and 29 potential drug candidates for breast cancer. 
These findings may advance understanding regarding the diagnosis, prognosis and 
treatment of breast cancer.

Human papilloma virus (HPV) causes a subset of head and neck squamous cell 
carcinomas (HNSCC) of the oropharynx. We combined targeted DNA- and genome-wide 
RNA-sequencing to identify genetic variants and gene expression signatures 
respectively from patients with HNSCC including oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinomas (OPSCC). DNA and RNA were purified from 35- formalin fixed and 
paraffin embedded (FFPE) HNSCC tumor samples. Immuno-histochemical evaluation of 
tumors was performed to determine the expression levels of p16INK4A and 
classified tumor samples either p16+ or p16-. Using ClearSeq Comprehensive 
Cancer panel, we examined the distribution of somatic mutations. Somatic 
single-nucleotide variants (SNV) were called using GATK-Mutect2 ("tumor-only" 
mode) approach. Using RNA-seq, we identified a catalog of 1,044 and 8 genes as 
significantly expressed between p16+ and p16-, respectively at FDR 0.05 (5%) and 
0.1 (10%). The clinicopathological characteristics of the patients including 
anatomical site, smoking and survival were analyzed when comparing p16+ and p16- 
tumors. The majority of tumors (65%) were p16+. Population sequence variant 
databases, including gnomAD, ExAC, COSMIC and dbSNP, were used to identify the 
mutational landscape of somatic sequence variants within sequenced genes. 
Hierarchical clustering of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples based on 
HPV-status was observed using differentially expressed genes. Using RNA-seq in 
parallel with targeted DNA-seq, we identified mutational and gene expression 
signatures characteristic of p16+ and p16- HNSCC. Our gene signatures are 
consistent with previously published data including TCGA and support the need to 
further explore the biologic relevance of these alterations in HNSCC.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a common skin cancer with an 
increasing incidence. As a pre-cancerous condition, actinic keratosis (AK) has 
an up to 20% risk of progression to cSCC. This study aims to define the 
potential genes that associated with genesis and progression of cSCC, thereby 
further identify critical biomarkers for the prevention, early diagnosis, and 
effective treatment of cSCC.Two datasets GSE42677 and GSE45216 were downloaded 
from the GEO. Microarray data analysis was applied to explore the differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between cSCC samples and AK samples. Then functional 
enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and drug-gene 
interaction analysis were performed to screen key genes.A total of 711 DEGs, 
including 238 upregulated genes and 473 downregulated genes, were screened out. 
DEGs mainly involved in pathways as extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor 
interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K-Akt) signaling pathway, and focal adhesion. Candidate genes, including 
upregulated genes as JUN, filamin A (FLNA), casein kinase 1 delta (CSNK1D), and 
histone cluster 1 H3 family member f (HIST1H3F), and downregulated genes as 
androgen receptor (AR), heat shock protein family H member 1 (HSPH1), 
tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM), LIM domain and actin 
binding 1 (LIMA1), and synaptopodin (SYNPO) were screened out. In drug-gene 
interaction analysis, 13 genes and 44 drugs were identified.This study 
demonstrates that genes JUN, FLNA, AR, HSPH1, and CSNK1D have the potential to 
function as targets for diagnosis and treatment of cSCC.

Modern drug discovery through de novo drug discovery entails high financial 
costs, low success rates, and lengthy trial periods. Drug repositioning presents 
a suitable approach for overcoming these issues by re-evaluating biological 
targets and modes of action of approved drugs. Coupling high-throughput 
technologies with genome-wide essentiality screens, network analysis, 
genome-scale metabolic modeling, and machine learning techniques enables the 
proposal of new drug-target signatures and uncovers unanticipated modes of 
action for available drugs. Here, we discuss the current issues associated with 
drug repositioning in light of curated high-throughput multi-omic databases, 
genome-wide screening technologies, and their application in systems 
biology/medicine approaches.

Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) such as bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia 
(SZ) and mood disorder (MD) are hard to manage due to overlapping symptoms and 
lack of biomarkers. Risk alleles of BD/SZ/MD are emerging, with evidence 
suggesting mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction as a critical factor for disease onset 
and progression. Mood stabilizing treatments for these disorders are scarce, 
revealing the need for biomarker discovery and artificial intelligence 
approaches to design synthetically accessible novel therapeutics. Here, we show 
mt involvement in NPDs by associating 245 mt proteins to BD/SZ/MD, with 7 common 
players in these disease categories. Analysis of over 650 publications suggests 
that 245 NPD-linked mt proteins are associated with 800 other mt proteins, with 
mt impairment likely to rewire these interactions. High dosage of mood 
stabilizers is known to alleviate manic episodes, but which compounds target mt 
pathways is another gap in the field that we address through mood 
stabilizer-gene interaction analysis of 37 prescriptions and over-the-counter 
psychotropic treatments, which we have refined to 15 mood-stabilizing agents. We 
show 26 of the 245 NPD-linked mt proteins are uniquely or commonly targeted by 
one or more of these mood stabilizers. Further, induced pluripotent stem 
cell-derived patient neurons and three-dimensional human brain organoids as 
reliable BD/SZ/MD models are outlined, along with multiomics methods and machine 
learning-based decision making tools for biomarker discovery, which remains a 
bottleneck for precision psychiatry medicine.

BACKGROUND: Precision medicine is a medical approach that takes into account 
individual genetic variability and often requires Next Generation Sequencing 
data in order to predict new treatments. Here we present GMIEC, Genomic Modules 
Identification et Characterization for genomics medicine, an application that is 
able to identify specific drugs at the level of single patient integrating 
multi-omics data such as RNA-sequencing, copy-number variation, methylation, 
Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation and Exome/Whole Genome sequencing. It is also 
possible to include clinical data related to each patient. GMIEC has been 
developed as a web-based R-Shiny platform and gives as output a table easy to 
use and explore.
RESULTS: We present GMIEC, a Shiny application for genomics medicine. The tool 
allows the users the integration of two or more multiple omics datasets (e.g. 
gene-expression, copy-number), at sample level, to identify groups of genes that 
share common genomic and corresponding drugs. We demonstrate the characteristics 
of our application by using it to analyze a prostate cancer data set.
CONCLUSIONS: GMIEC provides a simple interface for genomics medicine. GMIEC was 
develop with Shiny to provide an application that does not require advanced 
programming skills. GMIEC consists of three sub-application for the analysis 
(GMIEC-AN), the visualization (GMIEC-VIS) and the exploration of results 
(GMIEC-RES). GMIEC is an open source software and is available at 
https://github.com/guidmt/GMIEC-shiny.

BACKGROUND: Melanoma has the highest mortality rate of all skin tumors, and 
metastases are the major cause of death from it. The molecular mechanism leading 
to melanoma metastasis is currently unclear.
METHODS: With the goal of revealing the underlying mechanism, three data sets 
with accession numbers GSE8401, GSE46517 and GSE7956 were downloaded from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the differentially 
expressed gene (DEG) of primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma, three kinds of 
analyses were performed, namely functional annotation, protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network and module construction, and co-expression and 
drug-gene interaction prediction analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 41 up-regulated genes and 79 down-regulated genes was 
selected for subsequent analyses. Results of pathway enrichment analysis showed 
that extracellular matrix organization and proteoglycans in cancer are closely 
related to melanoma metastasis. In addition, seven pivotal genes were identified 
from PPI network, including CXCL8, THBS1, COL3A1, TIMP3, KIT, DCN, and IGFBP5, 
which have all been verified in the TCGA database and clinical specimens, but 
only CXCL8, THBS1 and KIT had significant differences in expression.
CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, CXCL8, THBS1 and KIT may be the hub genes in the 
metastasis of melanoma and thus may be regarded as therapeutic targets in the 
future.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the commonest gynaecological malignancy. Current 
prognostic markers are inadequate to accurately predict patient survival, 
necessitating novel prognostic markers, to improve treatment strategies. 
Telomerase has a unique role within the endometrium, whilst aberrant telomerase 
activity is a hallmark of many cancers. The aim of the current in silico study 
is to investigate the role of telomere and telomerase associated genes and 
proteins (TTAGPs) in EC to identify potential prognostic markers and therapeutic 
targets. Analysis of RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas identified 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in EC (568 TTAGPs out of 3467) and 
ascertained DEGs associated with histological subtypes, higher grade 
endometrioid tumours and late stage EC. Functional analysis demonstrated that 
DEGs were predominantly involved in cell cycle regulation, while the survival 
analysis identified 69 DEGs associated with prognosis. The protein-protein 
interaction network constructed facilitated the identification of hub genes, 
enriched transcription factor binding sites and drugs that may target the 
network. Thus, our in silico methods distinguished many critical genes 
associated with telomere maintenance that were previously unknown to contribute 
to EC carcinogenesis and prognosis, including NOP56, WFS1, ANAPC4 and TUBB4A. 
Probing the prognostic and therapeutic utility of these novel TTAGP markers will 
form an exciting basis for future research.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), an 
emerging Betacoronavirus, is the causative agent of COVID-19. Angiotensin 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), being the main cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, plays a 
role in the entry of the virus into the cell. Currently, there are neither 
specific antiviral drugs for the treatment or preventive drugs such as vaccines.
METHODS: We proposed a bioinformatics analysis to test in silico existing drugs 
as a fast way to identify an efficient therapy. We performed a differential 
expression analysis in order to identify differentially expressed genes in 
COVID-19 patients correlated with ACE-2 and we explored their direct relations 
with a network approach integrating also drug-gene interactions. The drugs with 
a central role in the network were also investigated with a molecular docking 
analysis.
RESULTS: We found 825 differentially expressed genes correlated with ACE2. The 
protein-protein interactions among differentially expressed genes identified a 
network of 474 genes and 1130 interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of drug-gene interactions in the network and 
molecular docking analysis allows us to obtain several drugs with antiviral 
activity that, alone or in combination with other treatment options, could be 
considered as therapeutic approaches against COVID-19.

Multiomics dissection of molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying 
autoimmune-associated noncoding SNPs.

Zhang L, Guo Y, Yang TL.

More than 90% of autoimmune-associated variants are located in noncoding 
regions, leading to challenges in deciphering the underlying causal roles of 
functional variants and genes and biological mechanisms. Therefore, to reduce 
the gap between traditional genetic findings and mechanistic understanding of 
disease etiologies and clinical drug development, it is important to translate 
systematically the regulatory mechanisms underlying noncoding variants. Here, we 
prioritized functional noncoding SNPs with regulatory gene targets associated 
with 19 autoimmune diseases by incorporating hundreds of immune cell-specific 
multiomics data. The prioritized SNPs are associated with transcription factor 
(TF) binding, histone modification, or chromatin accessibility, indicating their 
allele-specific regulatory roles. Their target genes are significantly enriched 
in immunologically related pathways and other known immunologically related 
functions. We found that 90.1% of target genes are regulated by distal SNPs 
involving several TFs (e.g., the DNA-binding protein CCCTC-binding factor 
[CTCF]), suggesting the importance of long-range chromatin interaction in 
autoimmune diseases. Moreover, we predicted potential drug targets for 
autoimmune diseases, including 2 genes (NFKB1 and SH2B3) with known drug 
indications on other diseases, highlighting their potential drug repurposing 
opportunities. Taken together, these findings may provide useful information for 
future experimental follow-up and drug applications on autoimmune diseases.

When trying to identify new potential therapeutic protein targets, access to 
data and knowledge is increasingly important. In a field where new resources and 
data sources become available every day, it is crucial to be able to take a step 
back and look at the wider picture in order to identify potential drug targets. 
While this task is routinely performed by bespoke literature searches, it is 
often time-consuming and lacks uniformity when comparing multiple targets at one 
time. To address this challenge, we developed TargetDB, a tool that aggregates 
public information available on given target(s) (links to disease, safety, 3D 
structures, ligandability, novelty, etc.) and assembles it in an easy to read 
output ready for the researcher to analyze. In addition, we developed a target 
scoring system based on the desirable attributes of good therapeutic targets and 
machine learning classification system to categorize novel targets as having 
promising or challenging tractrability. In this manuscript, we present the 
methodology used to develop TargetDB as well as test cases.

The development of high-throughput genotyping technologies and large biobank 
collections, complemented with rapid methodological advances in statistical 
genetics, has enabled hypothesis-free genome-wide association studies (GWAS), 
which have identified hundreds of genetic variants across many loci associated 
with musculoskeletal conditions. Similarly, basic scientists have valuable 
molecular cellular and animal data based on musculoskeletal disease that would 
be enhanced by being able to determine the human translation of their findings. 
By integrating these large-scale human genomic musculoskeletal datasets with 
complementary evidence from model organisms, new and existing genetic loci can 
be statistically fine-mapped to plausibly causal variants, candidate genes, and 
biological pathways. Genes and pathways identified using this approach can be 
further prioritized as drug targets, including side-effect profiling and the 
potential for new indications. To bring together these big data, and to realize 
the vision of creating a knowledge portal, the International Federation of 
Musculoskeletal Research Societies (IFMRS) established a working group to 
collaborate with scientists from the Broad Institute to create the 
Musculoskeletal Knowledge Portal (MSK-KP)(http://mskkp.org/). The MSK 
consolidates omics datasets from humans, cellular experiments, and model 
organisms into a central repository that can be accessed by researchers. The 
vision of the MSK-KP is to enable better understanding of the biological 
mechanisms underlying musculoskeletal disease and apply this knowledge to 
identify and develop new disease interventions. © 2020 American Society for Bone

BACKGROUND: This study was intended to investigate the genomic landscape of the 
immune microenvironments of brain metastases in breast cancer.
METHODS: Three gene expression profile datasets (GSE76714, GSE125989 and 
GSE43837) of breast cancer with brain metastases were downloaded from Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After differential expression analysis, the 
tumor immune microenvironment and immune cell infiltration were analyzed. Then 
immune-related genes were identified, followed by function analysis, 
transcription factor (TF)-miRNA-mRNA co-regulatory network analysis, and 
survival analysis of metastatic recurrence.
RESULTS: The present results showed that the tumor immune microenvironment in 
brain metastases was immunosuppressed compared with primary caner. Compared with 
primary cancer samples, the infiltration ratio of plasma cells in brain 
metastases samples was significantly higher, while the infiltration ratio of 
macrophages M2 cells in brain metastases samples was significantly lower. Total 
42 immune-related genes were identified, such as THY1 and NEU2. CD1B, THY1 and 
DOCK2 were found to be implicated in the metastatic recurrence of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting macrophages or plasma cells may be new strategies for 
immunotherapy of breast cancer with brain metastases. THY1 and NEU2 may be 
potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer with brain metastases, and THY1, 
CD1B and DOCK2 may serve as potential prognostic markers for improvement of 
brain metastases survival.

Drug combination is now a hot research topic in the pharmaceutical industry, but 
experiment-based methodologies are extremely costly in time and money. Many 
computational methods have been proposed to address these problems by starting 
from existing drug combinations. However, in most cases, only molecular 
structure information is included, which covers too limited a set of drug 
characteristics to efficiently screen drug combinations. Here, we integrated 
similarity-based multifeature drug data to improve the prediction accuracy by 
using the neighbor recommender method combined with ensemble learning 
algorithms. By conducting feature assessment analysis, we selected the most 
useful drug features and achieved 0.964 AUC in the ensemble models. The 
comparison results showed that the ensemble models outperform traditional 
machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), naïve Bayes 
(NB), and logistic regression (GLM). Furthermore, we predicted 7 candidate drug 
combinations for a specific drug, paclitaxel, and successfully verified that the 
two of the predicted combinations have promising effects.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spillover 
infection in December 2019 has caused an unprecedented pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, as 
other coronaviruses, binds its target cells through the angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Accordingly, this makes ACE2 research essential for 
understanding the zoonotic nature of coronaviruses and identifying novel drugs. 
Here we present a systematic analysis of the ACE2 conservation and co-evolution 
protein network across 1,671 eukaryotes, revealing an unexpected conservation 
pattern in specific metazoans, plants, fungi, and protists. We identified the 
co-evolved protein network and pinpointed a list of drugs that target this 
network by using data integration from different sources. Our computational 
analysis found widely used drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
and vasodilators. These drugs are expected to perturb the ACE2 network affecting 
infectivity as well as the pathophysiology of the disease.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most common histological 
subtype of esophageal cancer in India. Cigarette smoking and chewing tobacco are 
known risk factors associated with ESCC. However, genomic alterations associated 
with ESCC in India are not well-characterized. In this study, we carried out 
exome sequencing to characterize the mutational landscape of ESCC tumors from 
subjects with a varied history of tobacco usage. Whole exome sequence analysis 
of ESCC from an Indian cohort revealed several genes that were mutated or had 
copy number changes. ESCC from tobacco chewers had a higher frequency of C:G > 
A:T transversions and 2-fold enrichment for mutation signature 4 compared to 
smokers and non-users of tobacco. Genes, such as TP53, CSMD3, SYNE1, PIK3CA, and 
NOTCH1 were found to be frequently mutated in Indian cohort. Mutually exclusive 
mutation patterns were observed in PIK3CA-NOTCH1, DNAH5-ZFHX4, MUC16-FAT1, and 
ZFHX4-NOTCH1 gene pairs. Recurrent amplifications were observed in 3q22-3q29, 
11q13.3-q13.4, 7q22.1-q31.1, and 8q24 regions. Approximately 53% of tumors had 
genomic alterations in PIK3CA making this pathway a promising candidate for 
targeted therapy. In conclusion, we observe enrichment of mutation signature 4 
in ESCC tumors from patients with a history of tobacco chewing. This is likely 
due to direct exposure of esophagus to tobacco carcinogens when it is chewed and 
swallowed. Genomic alterations were frequently observed in PIK3CA-AKT pathway 
members independent of the history of tobacco usage. PIK3CA pathway can be 
potentially targeted in ESCC which currently has no effective targeted 
therapeutic options.

Over the last decade Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats 
(CRISPR) has been developed into a potent molecular biology tool used to rapidly 
modify genes or their expression in a multitude of ways. In parallel, 
CRISPR-based screening approaches have been developed as powerful discovery 
platforms for dissecting the genetic basis of cellular behavior, as well as for 
drug target discovery. CRISPR screens can be designed in numerous ways. Here, we 
give a brief background to CRISPR screens and discuss the pros and cons of 
different design approaches, including unbiased genome-wide screens that target 
all known genes, as well as hypothesis-driven custom screens in which selected 
subsets of genes are targeted (Fig. 1). We provide several suggestions for how a 
custom screen can be designed, which could broadly serve as inspiration for any 
experiment that includes candidate gene selection. Finally, we discuss how 
results from CRISPR screens could be translated into drug development, as well 
as future trends we foresee in the rapidly evolving CRISPR screen field.

Drug development (target identification, advancing drug leads to candidates for 
preclinical and clinical studies) can be facilitated by genetic and genomic 
knowledge. Here, we review the contribution of population genomics to target 
identification, the value of bulk and single cell gene expression analysis for 
understanding the biological relevance of a drug target, and genome-wide CRISPR 
editing for the prioritization of drug targets. In genomics, we discuss the 
different scope of genome-wide association studies using genotyping arrays, 
versus exome and whole genome sequencing. In transcriptomics, we discuss the 
information from drug perturbation and the selection of biomarkers. For CRISPR 
screens, we discuss target discovery, mechanism of action and the concept of 
gene to drug mapping. Harnessing genetic support increases the probability of 
drug developability and approval.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the leading cause of death for patients with 
osteosarcoma (OS). In the present study, we explore the biomarkers for 
metastatic OS and provide potential therapeutic approaches.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA-Seq data and clinical follow-up information were 
downloaded from TARGET and GEO databases. A Cox regression model was used to 
analyze metastatic events. L1000FWD, DGIdb, and CMap databases were used to 
identify potential drugs related to metastasis. Invasion and migration transwell 
assays and an adhesion assay were used to identify biological functions of 
genes.
RESULTS: A total of 15 metastasis-related signatures (MRSs) were associated with 
the prognosis based on the TARGET or GSE21257 cohorts, among which IL10RA and 
TLR7 genes were especially significant. In the DGIdb drug-gene interaction 
database, TLR7 and IFNGR1 were found to have potential interactions with drugs. 
After inhibiting the expression of TLR7, the migration, invasion, and adhesion 
ability of OS cells were significantly enhanced, which further promoted 
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: We identified a set of MRS that may be related to OS metastases. 
Among them, TLR7 plays a vital role and may be a potential target for OS 
metastasis treatment.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most malignant tumor in the female 
reproductive system. About 75% of OC in complete remission of clinical symptoms 
still develop a recurrence. Therefore, searching for new treatment methods plays 
an important role in improving the prognosis of OC.
METHODS: We downloaded the MAF files, RNA-seq data and clinical information from 
the TCGA database. The "maftools" package in R software was used to visualize 
the OC mutation data. We calculated the tumor mutation burden (TMB) of OC and 
analyzed its correlation with clinicopathological parameters and prognostic 
value. Tumor mutation burden related signature model was constructed to predict 
the overall survival (OS) of OC.
RESULTS: The results revealed that there was a statistical correlation between 
TMB and FIGO stage, grade and tumor residual size of ovarian cancer patients. 
The Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that a high TMB is associated with better 
clinical outcomes of OC. The difference analysis indicated 24 upregulated genes 
and 619 downregulated genes in the high-TMB group compared with the low-TMB 
group. Besides, the TMBRS model based on five hub genes (RBMS3, PLA2G5, CDH2, 
AMHR2 and ADAMTS8) was constructed to predict the OS of OC. The ROC curve and 
validation data sets all revealed that the TMBRS model was reliable in 
predicting recurrence risk. Immune microenvironment analysis indicated the 
correlations between TMB and infiltrating immune cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TMB plays an important role in the 
prognosis and guiding immunotherapy of OC. By detecting the TMB of OC, 
clinicians can more accurately treat patients with immunotherapy, thereby 
improving their survival rate.

Drug-induced Mood- and Cognition-related adverse events (MCAEs) are often only 
detected during the clinical trial phases of drug development, or even after 
marketing, thus posing a major safety concern and a challenge for both 
pharmaceutical companies and clinicians. To fill some gaps in the understanding 
and elucidate potential biological mechanisms of action frequently associated 
with MCAEs, we present a unique workflow linking observational population data 
with the available knowledge at molecular, cellular, and psychopharmacology 
levels. It is based on statistical analysis of pharmacovigilance reports and 
subsequent signaling pathway analyses, followed by evidence-based expert manual 
curation of the outcomes. Our analysis: (a) ranked pharmaceuticals with high 
occurrence of such adverse events (AEs), based on disproportionality analysis of 
the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, and (b) identified 120 
associated genes and common pathway nodes possibly underlying MCAEs. Nearly 
two-thirds of the identified genes were related to immune modulation, which 
supports the critical involvement of immune cells and their responses in the 
regulation of the central nervous system function. This finding also means that 
pharmaceuticals with a negligible central nervous system exposure may induce 
MCAEs through dysregulation of the peripheral immune system. Knowledge gained 
through this workflow unravels putative hallmark biological targets and 
mediators of drug-induced mood and cognitive disorders that need to be further 
assessed and validated in experimental models. Thereafter, they can be used to 
substantially improve in silico/in vitro/in vivo tools for predicting these 
adversities at a preclinical stage.

BACKGROUND: Unlike bone tissue, little progress has been made regarding 
cartilage regeneration, and many challenges remain. Furthermore, the key roles 
of cartilage lesion caused by traumas, focal lesion, or articular overstress 
remain unclear. Traumatic injuries to the meniscus as well as its degeneration 
are important risk factors for long-term joint dysfunction, degenerative joint 
lesions, and knee osteoarthritis (OA) a chronic joint disease characterized by 
degeneration of articular cartilage and hyperosteogeny. Nearly 50% of the 
individuals with meniscus injuries develop OA over time. Due to the limited 
inherent self-repair capacity of cartilage lesion, the Biomaterial 
drug-nanomedicine is considered to be a promising alternative. Therefore, it is 
important to elucidate the gene potential regeneration mechanisms and discover 
novel precise medication, which are identified through this study to investigate 
their function and role in pathogenesis.
METHODS: We downloaded the mRNA microarray statistics GSE117999, involving 
paired cartilage lesion tissue samples from 12 OA patients and 12 patients from 
a control group. First, we analyzed these statistics to recognize the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We then exposed the gene ontology (GO) 
annotation and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
enrichment analyses for these DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
were then constructed, from which we attained eight significant genes after a 
functional interaction analysis. Finally, we identified a potential nanomedicine 
attained from this assay set, using a wide range of inhibitor information 
archived in the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) 
database.
RESULTS: Sixty-six DEGs were identified with our standards for meaning (adjusted 
P-value < 0.01, |log2 - FC| ≥1.2). Furthermore, we identified eight hub genes 
and one potential nanomedicine - Selenocysteine based on these integrative data.
CONCLUSION: We identified eight hub genes that could work as prospective 
biomarkers for the diagnostic and biomaterial drug treatment of cartilage 
lesion, involving the novel genes CAMP, DEFA3, TOLLIP, HLA-DQA2, SLC38A6, 
SLC3A1, FAM20A, and ANO8. Meanwhile, these genes were mainly associated with 
immune response, immune mediator induction, and cell chemotaxis. Significant 
support is provided for obtaining a series of novel gene targets, and we 
identify potential mechanisms for cartilage regeneration and final nanomedicine 
immunotherapy in regenerative medicine.

A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified eight loci 
that are associated with heart rate variability (HRV), but candidate genes in 
these loci remain uncharacterized. We developed an image- and CRISPR/Cas9-based 
pipeline to systematically characterize candidate genes for HRV in live 
zebrafish embryos. Nine zebrafish orthologues of six human candidate genes were 
targeted simultaneously in eggs from fish that transgenically express GFP on 
smooth muscle cells (Tg[acta2:GFP]), to visualize the beating heart. An 
automated analysis of repeated 30 s recordings of beating atria in 381 live, 
intact zebrafish embryos at 2 and 5 days post-fertilization highlighted genes 
that influence HRV (hcn4 and si:dkey-65j6.2 [KIAA1755]); heart rate (rgs6 and 
hcn4); and the risk of sinoatrial pauses and arrests (hcn4). Exposure to 10 or 
25 µM ivabradine-an open channel blocker of HCNs-for 24 h resulted in a 
dose-dependent higher HRV and lower heart rate at 5 days post-fertilization. 
Hence, our screen confirmed the role of established genes for heart rate and 
rhythm (RGS6 and HCN4); showed that ivabradine reduces heart rate and increases 
HRV in zebrafish embryos, as it does in humans; and highlighted a novel gene 
that plays a role in HRV (KIAA1755).

Ependymoma is a heterogeneous entity of central nervous system tumors with 
well-established molecular groups. Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing to 
analyze ependymomas across molecular groups and anatomic locations to 
investigate their intratumoral heterogeneity and developmental origins. 
Ependymomas are composed of a cellular hierarchy initiating from 
undifferentiated populations, which undergo impaired differentiation toward 
three lineages of neuronal-glial fate specification. While prognostically 
favorable groups of ependymoma predominantly harbor differentiated cells, 
aggressive groups are enriched for undifferentiated cell populations. The 
delineated transcriptomic signatures correlate with patient survival and define 
molecular dependencies for targeted treatment approaches. Taken together, our 
analyses reveal a developmental hierarchy underlying ependymomas relevant to 
biological and clinical behavior.

To explore the biology of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and identify new 
therapeutic opportunities, we performed comprehensive proteogenomic 
characterization of 110 tumors and 101 matched normal adjacent tissues (NATs) 
incorporating genomics, epigenomics, deep-scale proteomics, phosphoproteomics, 
and acetylproteomics. Multi-omics clustering revealed four subgroups defined by 
key driver mutations, country, and gender. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic data 
illuminated biology downstream of copy number aberrations, somatic mutations, 
and fusions and identified therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with driver 
events involving KRAS, EGFR, and ALK. Immune subtyping revealed a complex 
landscape, reinforced the association of STK11 with immune-cold behavior, and 
underscored a potential immunosuppressive role of neutrophil degranulation. 
Smoking-associated LUADs showed correlation with other environmental exposure 
signatures and a field effect in NATs. Matched NATs allowed identification of 
differentially expressed proteins with potential diagnostic and therapeutic 
utility. This proteogenomics dataset represents a unique public resource for 
researchers and clinicians seeking to better understand and treat lung 
adenocarcinomas.

MOTIVATION: Mining drug-disease association and related interactions are 
essential for developing in silico drug repurposing (DR) methods and 
understanding underlying biological mechanisms. Recently, large-scale biological 
databases are increasingly available for pharmaceutical research, allowing for 
deep characterization for molecular informatics and drug discovery. However, DR 
is challenging due to the molecular heterogeneity of disease and diverse 
drug-disease associations. Importantly, the complexity of molecular target 
interactions, such as protein-protein interaction (PPI), remains to be 
elucidated. DR thus requires deep exploration of a multimodal biological network 
in an integrative context.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose BiFusion, a bipartite graph convolution 
network model for DR through heterogeneous information fusion. Our approach 
combines insights of multiscale pharmaceutical information by constructing a 
multirelational graph of drug-protein, disease-protein and PPIs. Especially, our 
model introduces protein nodes as a bridge for message passing among diverse 
biological domains, which provides insights into utilizing PPI for improved DR 
assessment. Unlike conventional graph convolution networks always assuming the 
same node attributes in a global graph, our approach models interdomain 
information fusion with bipartite graph convolution operation. We offered an 
exploratory analysis for finding novel drug-disease associations. Extensive 
experiments showed that our approach achieved improved performance than multiple 
baselines for DR analysis.

A major cause of failed drug discovery programs is suboptimal target selection, 
resulting in the development of drug candidates that are potent inhibitors, but 
ineffective at treating the disease. In the genomics era, the availability of 
large biomedical datasets with genome-wide readouts has the potential to 
transform target selection and validation. In this study we investigate how 
computational intelligence methods can be applied to predict novel therapeutic 
targets in oncology. We compared different machine learning classifiers applied 
to the task of drug target classification for nine different human cancer types. 
For each cancer type, a set of "known" target genes was obtained and 
equally-sized sets of "non-targets" were sampled multiple times from the human 
protein-coding genes. Models were trained on mutation, gene expression (TCGA), 
and gene essentiality (DepMap) data. In addition, we generated a numerical 
embedding of the interaction network of protein-coding genes using deep network 
representation learning and included the results in the modeling. We assessed 
feature importance using a random forests classifier and performed feature 
selection based on measuring permutation importance against a null distribution. 
Our best models achieved good generalization performance based on the AUROC 
metric. With the best model for each cancer type, we ran predictions on more 
than 15,000 protein-coding genes to identify potential novel targets. Our 
results indicate that this approach may be useful to inform early stages of the 
drug discovery pipeline.

Problematic alcohol use (PAU) is a leading cause of death and disability 
worldwide. Although genome-wide association studies have identified PAU risk 
genes, the genetic architecture of this trait is not fully understood. We 
conducted a proxy-phenotype meta-analysis of PAU, combining alcohol use disorder 
and problematic drinking, in 435,563 European-ancestry individuals. We 
identified 29 independent risk variants, 19 of them novel. PAU was genetically 
correlated with 138 phenotypes, including substance use and psychiatric traits. 
Phenome-wide polygenic risk score analysis in an independent biobank sample 
(BioVU, n = 67,589) confirmed the genetic correlations between PAU and substance 
use and psychiatric disorders. Genetic heritability of PAU was enriched in brain 
and in conserved and regulatory genomic regions. Mendelian randomization 
suggested causal effects on liability to PAU of substance use, psychiatric 
status, risk-taking behavior and cognitive performance. In summary, this large 
PAU meta-analysis identified novel risk loci and revealed genetic relationships 
with numerous other traits.

The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to 
affect a growing number of populations in different parts of the world. In the 
current situation, drug repurposing is a viable strategy to combat COVID-19. The 
drugs targeting the host receptors that interact with SARS-CoV-2 are possible 
candidates. However, assessment of their effectiveness in COVID-19 patients is 
necessary before prioritizing them for further study. We attempted to shortlist 
the candidate drugs using an in-silico approach. First, we analysed two 
published transcriptomic data sets of COVID-19- and SARS-infected patients 
compared to healthy individuals to find the key pathways altered after 
infection. Then, using publicly available drug perturbational data sets in human 
cell lines from the Broad Institute Connectivity Map (CMAP), we assessed the 
effects of the approved drugs on the altered pathways. We also used the 
available pharmacogenomic data sets from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in 
Cancer (GDSC) portal to assess the effects of the altered pathways on resistance 
or sensitivity to the drugs in human cell lines. Our analysis identified many 
candidate drugs, some of which are already being investigated for treatment of 
COVID-19 and can serve as a basis for prioritizing additional viable candidate 
drugs for COVID-19.

Currently, the development of new effective drugs for cancer therapy is not only 
hindered by development costs, drug efficacy, and drug safety but also by the 
rapid occurrence of drug resistance in cancer. Hence, new tools are needed to 
study the underlying mechanisms in cancer. Here, we discuss the current use of 
metabolic modelling approaches to identify cancer-specific metabolism and find 
possible new drug targets and drugs for repurposing. Furthermore, we list 
valuable resources that are needed for the reconstruction of cancer-specific 
models by integrating various available datasets with genome-scale metabolic 
reconstructions using model-building algorithms. We also discuss how new drug 
targets can be determined by using gene essentiality analysis, an in silico 
method to predict essential genes in a given condition such as cancer and how 
synthetic lethality studies could greatly benefit cancer patients by suggesting 
drug combinations with reduced side effects.

BACKGROUND Accumulating evidence suggests that cardiotoxicity is one of the main 
manifestations of aconitine (AC) poisoning. However, the molecular mechanism of 
AC-induced cardiotoxicity remains unclear, there is little direct evidence for 
therapeutic targets and drugs of AC-induced cardiotoxicity. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Zebrafish were exposed to AC to evaluate cardiotoxicity by calculating the heart 
rates and observing the changes of cardiac and vascular structure. RNA-seq (RNA 
sequencing) and bioinformatics analysis were used to obtain differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs). The anti-AC cardiotoxicity compound was identified via 
connectivity map (CMAP) analysis and molecular docking. RESULTS AC-induced 
cardiotoxicity in zebrafish predominantly included arrhythmias, extended sinus 
venous and bulbus arteriosus (SV-BA) distance, and larger pericardial edema 
aera. A total of 1380 DEGs were identified by RNA-seq and bioinformatics 
analysis. cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) was screened as the hub gene and the 
most potential therapeutic target due to its significant downregulation in 
cardiotoxicity based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) and drug-gene 
interaction (DGIdb) network analysis. Cell cycle signal pathway was the most 
significant pathways identified in the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia 
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the expression of 
CDK1 was validated in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database GSE71906, 
GSE65705, and GSE95140. Finally, heptaminol was identified as a novel anti-AC

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant type of esophageal 
cancer in the Asian region, including Japan. A previous study reported 
mutational landscape of Japanese ESCCs by using exome sequencing. However, 
somatic structural alterations were yet to be explored. To provide a 
comprehensive mutational landscape, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) 
analysis of biopsy specimens from 20 ESCC patients in a Japanese population. WGS 
analysis identified non-silent coding mutations of TP53, ZNF750 and FAT1 in 
ESCC. We detected six mutational signatures in ESCC, one of which showed 
significant association with smoking status. Recurrent structural variations, 
many of which were chromosomal deletions, affected genes such as LRP1B, TTC28, 
CSMD1, PDE4D, SDK1 and WWOX in 25%-30% of tumors. Somatic copy number 
amplifications at 11q13.3 (CCND1), 3q26.33 (TP63/SOX2), and 8p11.23 (FGFR1) and 
deletions at 9p21.3 (CDKN2A) were identified. Overall, these multi-dimensional 
view of genomic alterations improve the understanding of the ESCC development at 
molecular level and provides future prognosis and therapeutic implications for 
ESCC in Japan.

Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis is an important tool to elucidate the 
causal relevance of environmental and biological risk factors for disease. 
However, causal inference is undermined if genetic variants used to instrument a 
risk factor also influence alternative disease-pathways (horizontal pleiotropy). 
Here we report how the 'no horizontal pleiotropy assumption' is strengthened 
when proteins are the risk factors of interest. Proteins are typically the 
proximal effectors of biological processes encoded in the genome. Moreover, 
proteins are the targets of most medicines, so MR studies of drug targets are 
becoming a fundamental tool in drug development. To enable such studies, we 
introduce a mathematical framework that contrasts MR analysis of proteins with 
that of risk factors located more distally in the causal chain from gene to 
disease. We illustrate key model decisions and introduce an analytical framework 
for maximising power and evaluating the robustness of analyses.

Data-driven analyses are increasingly valued in modern medicine. We integrate 
quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics from over 1,000 post-mortem brains 
from six cohorts representing Alzheimer's disease (AD), asymptomatic AD, 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and control patients from the Accelerating 
Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer's Disease consortium. We define robust 
co-expression trajectories related to disease progression, including early 
neuronal, microglial, astrocyte, and immune response modules, and later mRNA 
splicing and mitochondrial modules. The majority of, but not all, modules are 
conserved at the transcriptomic level, including module C3, which is only 
observed in proteome networks and enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) signaling. Genetic risk enriches in modules changing early in disease and 
indicates that AD and PSP have distinct causal biological drivers at the pathway 
level, despite aspects of similar pathology, including synaptic loss and glial 
inflammatory changes. The conserved, high-confidence proteomic changes enriched 
in genetic risk represent targets for drug discovery.

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. The molecular 
etiology of glaucoma is complex and unclear. At present, there are few drugs 
available for glaucoma treatment. The aim of the present study was to perform a 
systematic analysis of glaucoma candidate drugs/chemicals based on glaucoma 
genes, including genetic factors and differentially expressed (DE) genes. In 
total, 401 genes from the genetic databases and 1656 genes from the DE gene 
analysis were included in further analyses. In terms of glaucoma-related genetic 
factors, 54 pathways were significantly enriched (FDR < 0.05), and 96 pathways 
for DE genes were significantly enriched (FDR < 0.05). A search of the PheWAS 
database for diseases associated with glaucoma-related genes returned 1,289 
diseases, and a search for diseases associated with DE glaucoma-related genes 
returned 1,356 diseases. Cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, 
cancer, and ophthalmic diseases were highly related to glaucoma genes. A search 
of the DGIdb, KEGG, and CLUE databases revealed a set of drugs/chemicals 
targeting glaucoma genes. A subsequent analysis of the electronic medical 
records (EMRs) of 136,128 patients treated in Sichuan Provincial People's 
Hospital for candidate drug usage and the onset of glaucoma revealed nine 
candidate drugs. Among these drugs, individuals treated with nicardipine had the 
lowest incidence of glaucoma. Taken together with the information from the drug 
databases, the 40 most likely candidate drugs for glaucoma treatment were 
highlighted. Based on these findings, we concluded that the molecular mechanism 
of glaucoma is complex and may be a reflection of systemic diseases. A set of 
ready-to-use candidate drugs targeting glaucoma genes may be developed for 
glaucoma clinical drug treatments. Our results provide a systematic 
interpretation of glaucoma genes, interactions with other systemic diseases, and 
candidate drugs/chemicals.

The prognosis for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is 
extremely poor, mainly due to rapid progression and a paucity of effective 
drugs. Genome-wide analysis allows for potential drugs to be explored based on 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs). However, drug candidates and DEGs in HCC 
are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated DEGs and prognostication 
using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium 
(ICGC), the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and immunohistochemical staining. 
Protein-protein interaction networks between DEGs were also analyzed to clarify 
12 hub genes and query online databases for potential HCC therapeutic drugs. We 
found that 885 of 3219 DEGs from a TCGA dataset were associated with prognosis. 
We clarified 12 hub genes that were overexpressed in tumor samples and 
significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. These 
findings were validated using GEO and ICGC cohorts. Moreover, promising drug 
candidates targeted against HCC were predicted using online databases. 
Collectively, the upregulation of 12 hub genes was associated with poor 
prognosis for patients with HCC, and focusing on their expression may advance 
efforts towards targeted HCC therapies.

Drug development is a very costly and lengthy process, while repositioned or 
repurposed drugs could be brought into clinical practice within a shorter 
time-frame and at a much reduced cost. Numerous computational approaches to drug 
repositioning have been developed, but methods utilizing genome-wide association 
studies (GWASs) data are less explored. The past decade has observed a massive 
growth in the amount of data from GWAS; the rich information contained in GWAS 
has great potential to guide drug repositioning or discovery. While multiple 
tools are available for finding the most relevant genes from GWAS hits, 
searching for top susceptibility genes is only one way to guide repositioning, 
which has its own limitations. Here we provide a comprehensive review of 
different computational approaches that employ GWAS data to guide drug 
repositioning. These methods include selecting top candidate genes from GWAS as 
drug targets, deducing drug candidates based on drug-drug and disease-disease 
similarities, searching for reversed expression profiles between drugs and 
diseases, pathway-based methods as well as approaches based on analysis of 
biological networks. Each method is illustrated with examples, and their 
respective strengths and limitations are discussed. We also discussed several 
areas for future research.

BACKGROUND: -Maintenance of tight controls on circulating blood metabolites is 
crucial to normal, healthy tissue and organismal function. A number of single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with changes in the levels 
of blood metabolites. However, the impacts of the metabolite-associated SNPs are 
largely unknown because they fall within non-coding regions of the genome.
OBJECTIVE: -We aimed to identify genes and tissues that are linked to changes in 
circulating blood metabolites by characterizing genome-wide spatial regulatory 
interactions involving blood metabolite-associated SNPs.
METHOD: -We systematically integrated chromatin interaction (Hi-C), expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL), gene ontology, drug interaction, and 
literature-supported connections to deconvolute the genetic regulatory 
influences of 145 blood metabolite-associated SNPs.
FINDINGS: -We identified 577 genes that are regulated by 130 distal and proximal 
metabolite-associated SNPs across 48 different human tissues. The affected genes 
are enriched in categories that include metabolism, enzymes, plasma proteins, 
disease development, and potential drug targets. Our results suggest that 
regulatory interactions in other tissues contribute to the modulation of blood 
metabolites.
CONCLUSIONS: -The spatial SNP-gene-metabolite associations identified in this 
study expand on the list of genes and tissues that are influenced by 
metabolic-associated SNPs and improves our understanding of the molecular 
mechanisms underlying pathologic blood metabolite levels.

Ongoing social, political and ecological changes in the 21st century have placed 
more people at risk of life-threatening acute and chronic infections than ever 
before. The development of new diagnostic, prophylactic, therapeutic and 
curative strategies is critical to address this burden but is predicated on a 
detailed understanding of the immensely complex relationship between pathogens 
and their hosts. Traditional, reductionist approaches to investigate this 
dynamic often lack the scale and/or scope to faithfully model the dual and 
co-dependent nature of this relationship, limiting the success of translational 
efforts. With recent advances in large-scale, quantitative omics methods as well 
as in integrative analytical strategies, systems biology approaches for the 
study of infectious disease are quickly forming a new paradigm for how we 
understand and model host-pathogen relationships for translational applications. 
Here, we delineate a framework for a systems biology approach to infectious 
disease in three parts: discovery - the design, collection and analysis of omics 
data; representation - the iterative modelling, integration and visualization of 
complex data sets; and application - the interpretation and hypothesis-based 
inquiry towards translational outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Data mining technology used in the field of medicine has been widely 
studied by scholars all over the world. But there is little research on medical 
data mining (MDM) from the perspectives of bibliometrics and visualization, and 
the research topics and development trends in this field are still unclear.
METHODS: This paper has applied bibliometric visualization software tools, 
VOSviewer 1.6.10 and CiteSpace V, to study the citation characteristics, 
international cooperation, author cooperation, and geographical distribution of 
the MDM.
RESULTS: A total of 1575 documents are obtained, and the most frequent document 
type is article (1376). SHAN NH is the most productive author, with the highest 
number of publications of 12, and the Gillies's article (750 times citation) is 
the most cited paper. The most productive country and institution in MDM is the 
USA (559) and US FDA (35), respectively. The Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 
Expert Systems with Applications and Journal of Medical Systems are the most 
productive journals, which reflected the nature of the research, and keywords 
"classification (790)" and "system (576)" have the strongest strength. The hot 
topics in MDM are drug discovery, medical imaging, vaccine safety, and so on. 
The 3 frontier topics are reporting system, precision medicine, and 
inflammation, and would be the foci of future research.
CONCLUSION: The present study provides a panoramic view of data mining methods 
applied in medicine by visualization and bibliometrics. Analysis of authors, 
journals, institutions, and countries could provide reference for researchers 
who are fresh to the field in different ways. Researchers may also consider the 
emerging trends when deciding the direction of their study.

BACKGROUND: Skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is one of the most malignant and 
aggressive cancers, causing about 72% of deaths in skin carcinoma. Although 
extensive study has explored the mechanism of recurrence and metastasis, the 
tumorigenesis of cutaneous melanoma remains unclear. Exploring the tumorigenesis 
mechanism may help identify prognostic biomarkers that could serve to guide 
cancer therapy.
METHOD: Integrative bioinformatics analyses, including GEO database, TCGA 
database, DAVID, STRING, Metascape, GEPIA, cBioPortal, TRRUST, TIMER, TISIDB and 
DGIdb, were performed to unveil the hub genes participating in tumor progression 
and cancer-associated immunology of SKCM. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) staining was performed to validate differential expression levels of hub 
genes between SKCM tissue and normal tissues from the First Affiliated Hospital 
of Soochow University cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 308 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 12 hub genes 
were found significantly differentially expressed between SKCM and normal skin 
tissues. Functional annotation indicated that inflammatory response, immune 
response was closely associated with SKCM tumorigenesis. KEGG pathways in hub 
genes include IL-10 signaling and chemokine receptors bind chemokine signaling. 
Five chemokines members (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, CCL4, CCL5) were associated with 
better overall survival and pathological stages. IHC results suggested that 
significantly elevated CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, CCL4 and CCL5 proteins expressed 
in the SKCM than in the normal tissues. Moreover, our findings suggested that 
IRF7, RELA, NFKB1, IRF3 and IRF1 are key transcription factors for CCL4, CCL5, 
CXCL10. In addition, the expressions of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, CCL4 and CCL5 
were positively correlated with infiltration of six immune cells (B cell, CD8+T 
cells, CD4+T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells) and 28 types of 
TILs. Among them, high levels of B cells, CD8+T cells, neutrophils and dendritic 
cells were significantly related to longer SKCM survival time.
CONCLUSION: In summary, this study mainly identified five chemokine members 
(CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, CCL4, CCL5) associated with SKCM tumorigenesis,

Despite advances in the treatment of cervical cancer (CC), the prognosis of 
patients with CC remains to be improved. This study aimed to explore candidate 
gene targets for CC. CC datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus database. Genes with similar expression trends in varying steps of CC 
development were clustered using Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) 
software. Gene functions were then analyzed using the Gene Ontology (GO) 
database and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. 
Protein interactions among genes of interest were predicted, followed by 
drug-target genes and prognosis-associated genes. The expressions of the 
predicted genes were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. Red and green profiles with upward and 
downward gene expressions, respectively, were screened using STEM software. 
Genes with increased expression were significantly enriched in DNA replication, 
cell-cycle-related biological processes, and the p53 signaling pathway. Based on 
the predicted results of the Drug-Gene Interaction database, 17 drug-gene 
interaction pairs, including 3 red profile genes (TOP2A, RRM2, and POLA1) and 16 
drugs, were obtained. The Cancer Genome Atlas data analysis showed that high 
POLA1 expression was significantly correlated with prolonged survival, 
indicating that POLA1 is protective against CC. RT-qPCR and Western blotting 
showed that the expressions of TOP2A, RRM2, and POLA1 gradually increased in the 
multistep process of CC. TOP2A, RRM2, and POLA1 may be targets for the treatment 
of CC. However, many studies are needed to validate our findings.

As researchers are increasingly able to collect data on a large scale from 
multiple clinical and omics modalities, multi-omics integration is becoming a 
critical component of metabolomics research. This introduces a need for 
increased understanding by the metabolomics researcher of computational and 
statistical analysis methods relevant to multi-omics studies. In this review, we 
discuss common types of analyses performed in multi-omics studies and the 
computational and statistical methods that can be used for each type of 
analysis. We pinpoint the caveats and considerations for analysis methods, 
including required parameters, sample size and data distribution requirements, 
sources of a priori knowledge, and techniques for the evaluation of model 
accuracy. Finally, for the types of analyses discussed, we provide examples of 
the applications of corresponding methods to clinical and basic research. We 
intend that our review may be used as a guide for metabolomics researchers to 
choose effective techniques for multi-omics analyses relevant to their field of 
study.

BACKGROUND: A major impediment in the treatment of ovarian cancer is the relapse 
of chemotherapy-resistant tumors, which occurs in approximately 25% of patients. 
A better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying chemotherapy 
resistance will improve treatment efficacy through genetic testing and novel 
therapies.
METHODS: Using data from high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) patients in 
the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we classified those who remained 
progression-free for 12 months following platinum-taxane combination 
chemotherapy as "chemo-sensitive" (N = 160) and those who had recurrence within 
6 months as "chemo-resistant" (N = 110). Univariate and multivariate analysis of 
expression microarray data were used to identify differentially expressed genes 
and co-expression gene networks associated with chemotherapy response. Moreover, 
we integrated genomics data to determine expression quantitative trait loci 
(eQTL).
RESULTS: Differential expression of the Valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene 
and five co-expression gene networks were significantly associated with 
chemotherapy response in HGSOC. VCP and the most significant co-expression 
network module contribute to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, 
which has been implicated in chemotherapy response. Both univariate and 
multivariate analysis findings were successfully replicated in an independent 
ovarian cancer cohort. Furthermore, we identified 192 cis-eQTLs associated with 
the expression of network genes and 4 cis-eQTLs associated with BRCA2 
expression.
CONCLUSION: This study implicates both known and novel genes as well as 
biological processes underlying response to platinum-taxane-based chemotherapy 
among HGSOC patients.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects cells of the airway and lungs in humans causing the 
disease COVID-19. This disease is characterized by cough, shortness of breath, 
and in severe cases causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) which can be fatal. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma 
from mild and severe cases of COVID-19 have been profiled using protein 
measurements and bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Onset of pneumonia and 
ARDS can be rapid in COVID-19, suggesting a potential neuronal involvement in 
pathology and mortality. We sought to quantify how immune cells might interact 
with sensory innervation of the lung in COVID-19 using published data from 
patients, existing RNA sequencing datasets from human dorsal root ganglion 
neurons and other sources, and a genome-wide ligand-receptor pair database 
curated for pharmacological interactions relevant for neuro-immune interactions. 
Our findings reveal a landscape of ligand-receptor interactions in the lung 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and point to potential interventions to 
reduce the burden of neurogenic inflammation in COVID-19 disease. In particular, 
our work highlights opportunities for clinical trials with existing or under 
development rheumatoid arthritis and other (e.g. CCL2, CCR5 or EGFR inhibitors) 
drugs to treat high risk or severe COVID-19 cases.

Overexpression of transcription factor 3 in alveolar soft part sarcoma(ASPS) 
results in upregulation of cell proliferation pathways. No standard treatment 
algorithm exists for ASPS; multikinase inhibitors[tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI)] and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown clinical benefit. To 
date, no studies have reported on management strategies or sequencing of 
therapy. We evaluated ASPS treatment patterns and responses in an experimental 
therapeutics clinic. Genomic and morphoproteomic analysis was performed to 
further elucidate novel targets. We retrospectively reviewed patients with ASPS 
treated on clinical trials. Demographic and clinical next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) profiles were collected. AACR GENIE database was queried to further 
evaluate aberrations in ASPS. Morphoproteomic analysis was carried out to better 
define the biology of ASPS with integration of genomic and proteomic findings. 
Eleven patients with ASPS were identified; 7 received NGS testing and mutations 
in CDKN2A (n = 1) and hepatocyte growth factor (n = 1) were present. Ten 
patients were treated with TKIs with stable disease as best response and 4 
patients with ICI (three partial responses). Within GENIE, 20 patients were 
identified harboring 3 called pathogenic mutations. Tumor mutation burden was 
low in all samples. Morphoproteomic analysis confirmed the expression of 
phosphorylated c-Met. In addition, fatty acid synthase and phosphorylated-STAT3 
were detected in tumor cell cytoplasm and nuclei. Patients with ASPS have a 
quiescent genome and derive clinical benefit from VEGF-targeting TKIs. 
Morphoproteomic analysis has provided both additional correlative pathways and 
angiogenic mechanisms that are targetable for patients with ASPS. Our study 
suggests that sequential therapy with TKIs and immune checkpoint inhibitors is a 
reasonable management strategy.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) in patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: RNA-seq data were obtained from the Array Express database. DEG were 
identified using the edgeR package. A co-expression network was constructed and 
key modules with the highest correlation with IBD inflammatory sites were 
identified for analysis. The Cytoscape MCODE plugin was used to identify key 
sub-modules of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The genes in the 
sub-modules were considered hub genes, and functional enrichment analysis was 
performed. Furthermore, we constructed a drug-gene interaction network. Finally, 
we visualized the hub gene expression pattern between the colon and ileum of IBD 
using the ggpubr package and analyzed it using the Wilcoxon test.
RESULTS: DEG were identified between the colon and ileum of IBD patients. Based 
on the co-expression network, the green module had the highest correlation with 
IBD inflammatory sites. In total, 379 DEG in the green module were identified 
for the PPI network. Nineteen hub genes were differentially expressed between 
the colon and ileum. The drug-gene network identified these hub genes as 
potential drug targets.
CONCLUSION: Nineteen DEG were identified between the colon and ileum of IBD 
patients.

Muscle weakness is a common consequence of both aging (sarcopenia) and 
neuromuscular disorders (NMD). Whilst genome-wide association (GWA) studies have 
identified genetic variants associated with grip strength (GS; measure of muscle 
strength/weakness) and NMDs, including multiple sclerosis (MS), myasthenia 
gravis (MG) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), it is not known whether 
there are common mechanisms between these phenotypes. To examine this, we have 
integrated GS and NMD associated genetic variants (single nucleotide 
polymorphisms; SNPs) in a multimorbid analysis that leverages high-throughput 
chromatin interaction (Hi-C) data and expression quantitative trait loci data to 
identify target genes (i.e., SNP-mediated gene regulation). Biological pathways 
enriched by these genes were then identified using next-generation pathway 
enrichment analysis. Lastly, druggable genes were identified using drug gene 
interaction (DGI) database. We identified gene regulatory mechanisms associated 
with GS, MG, MS, and ALS. The SNPs associated with GS regulate a subset of genes 
that are also regulated by the SNPs of MS, MG, and ALS. Yet, we did not find any 
genes commonly regulated by all four phenotype associated SNPs. By contrast, we 
identified significant enrichment in three pathways (mTOR signaling, axon 
guidance, and alcoholism) that are commonly affected by the gene regulatory 
mechanisms associated with all four phenotypes. 13% of the genes we identified 
were known drug targets, and GS shares at least one druggable gene and pathway 
with each of the NMD phenotypes. We have identified significant biological 
overlaps between GS and NMD, demonstrating the potential for spatial genetic 
analysis to identify common mechanisms between potential multimorbid phenotypes. 
Collectively, our results form the foundation for a shift from a gene to a 
pathway-based approach to the rationale design of therapeutic interventions and 
treatments for NMD.

Precision oncology has primarily relied on coding mutations as biomarkers of 
response to therapies. While transcriptome analysis can provide valuable 
information, incorporation into workflows has been difficult. For example, the 
relative rather than absolute gene expression level needs to be considered, 
requiring differential expression analysis across samples. However, expression 
programs related to the cell-of-origin and tumor microenvironment effects 
confound the search for cancer-specific expression changes. To address these 
challenges, we developed an unsupervised clustering approach for discovering 
differential pathway expression within cancer cohorts using gene expression 
measurements. The hydra approach uses a Dirichlet process mixture model to 
automatically detect multimodally distributed genes and expression signatures 
without the need for matched normal tissue. We demonstrate that the hydra 
approach is more sensitive than widely-used gene set enrichment approaches for 
detecting multimodal expression signatures. Application of the hydra analysis 
framework to small blue round cell tumors (including rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial 
sarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma) identified expression 
signatures associated with changes in the tumor microenvironment. The hydra 
approach also identified an association between ATRX deletions and elevated 
immune marker expression in high-risk neuroblastoma. Notably, hydra analysis of 
all small blue round cell tumors revealed similar subtypes, characterized by 
changes to infiltrating immune and stromal expression signatures.

Previous studies reported that Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the 
main cell receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It plays a key role in the access 
of the virus into the cell to produce the final infection. In the present study 
we investigated in silico the basic mechanism of ACE2 in the lung and provided 
evidences for new potentially effective drugs for Covid-19. Specifically, we 
used the gene expression profiles from public datasets including The Cancer 
Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and Genotype-Tissue Expression, Gene 
Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis to investigate the main functions of 
ACE2-correlated genes. We constructed a protein-protein interaction network 
containing the genes co-expressed with ACE2. Finally, we focused on the genes in 
the network that are already associated with known drugs and evaluated their 
role for a potential treatment of Covid-19. Our results demonstrate that the 
genes correlated with ACE2 are mainly enriched in the sterol biosynthetic 
process, Aryldialkylphosphatase activity, adenosylhomocysteinase activity, 
trialkylsulfonium hydrolase activity, acetate-CoA and CoA ligase activity. We 
identified a network of 193 genes, 222 interactions and 36 potential drugs that 
could have a crucial role. Among possible interesting drugs for Covid-19 
treatment, we found Nimesulide, Fluticasone Propionate, Thiabendazole, 
Photofrin, Didanosine and Flutamide.

INTRODUCTION: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is genetically and 
clinically heterogeneous. Despite advances in genomic subtyping, standard 
frontline chemoimmunotherapy has remained unchanged for years. As 
high-throughput analysis becomes more accessible, characterizing drug-gene 
interactions in DLBCL could support patient-specific treatment strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From our systematic literature review, we compiled a 
comprehensive list of somatic mutations implicated in DLBCL. We extracted 
reported and primary sequencing data for these mutations and assessed their 
association with signaling pathways, cell-of-origin subtypes, and clinical 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Twenty-two targetable mutations present in ≥ 5% of patients with DLBCL 
were associated with unfavorable outcomes, yielding a predicted population of 
31.7% of DLBCL cases with poor-risk disease and candidacy for targeted therapy. 
A second review identified 256 studies that had characterized the drug-gene 
interactions for these mutations via in vitro studies, mouse models, and/or 
clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel approach linking the data from our systematic reviews 
with informatics tools identified high-risk DLBCL subgroups, DLBCL-specific 
drug-gene interactions, and potential populations for precision medicine trials.

The cell cycle is a highly conserved process involving the coordinated 
separation of a single cell into two daughter cells. To relate transcriptional 
regulation across the cell cycle with oscillatory changes in protein abundance 
and activity, we carried out a proteome- and phospho-proteome-wide mass 
spectrometry profiling. We compared protein dynamics with gene transcription, 
revealing many transcriptionally regulated G2 mRNAs that only produce a protein 
shift after mitosis. Integration of CRISPR/Cas9 survivability studies further 
highlighted proteins essential for cell viability. Analyzing the dynamics of 
phosphorylation events and protein solubility dynamics over the cell cycle, we 
characterize predicted phospho-peptide motif distributions and predict cell 
cycle-dependent translocating proteins, as exemplified by the 
S-adenosylmethionine synthase MAT2A. Our study implicates this enzyme in 
translocating to the nucleus after the G1/S-checkpoint, which enables epigenetic 
histone methylation maintenance during DNA replication. Taken together, this 
data set provides a unique integrated resource with novel insights on cell cycle 
dynamics.

Leukaemogenic mutations commonly disrupt cellular differentiation and/or enhance 
proliferation, thus perturbing the regulatory programs that control self-renewal 
and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells. Translocations involving the 
Mll1 (Kmt2a) gene generate powerful oncogenic fusion proteins, predominantly 
affecting infant and paediatric AML and ALL patients. The early stages of 
leukaemogenic transformation are typically inaccessible from human patients and 
conventional mouse models. Here, we take advantage of cells conditionally 
blocked at the multipotent haematopoietic progenitor stage to develop a MLL-r 
model capturing early cellular and molecular consequences of MLL-ENL expression 
based on a clear clonal relationship between parental and leukaemic cells. 
Through a combination of scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 
screening, we identify pathways and genes likely to drive the early phases of 
leukaemogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate the broad utility of using matched 
parental and transformed cells for small molecule inhibitor studies by 
validating both previously known and other potential therapeutic targets.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide. 
While both genetic and environmental factors have been linked to the incidence 
and mortality associated with CRC, an ethnic aspect of its etiology has also 
emerged. Since previous large-scale cancer genomics studies are mostly based on 
samples of European ancestry, the patterns of clinical events and associated 
mechanisms in other minority ethnic patients suffering from CRC are largely 
unexplored. We collected 104 paired and adjacent normal tissue and CRC tumor 
samples from Taiwanese patients and employed an integrated approach - paired 
expression profiles of mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) combined with 
transcriptome-wide network analyses - to catalog the molecular signatures of 
this regional cohort. On the basis of this dataset, which is the largest ever 
reported for this type of systems analysis, we made the following key 
discoveries: (1) In comparison to the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, the 
Taiwanese CRC tumors show similar perturbations in expressed genes but a 
distinct enrichment in metastasis-associated pathways. (2) Recurrent as well as 
novel CRC-associated gene fusions were identified based on the sequencing data. 
(3) Cancer subtype classification using existing tools reveals a comparable 
distribution of tumor subtypes between Taiwanese cohort and TCGA datasets; 
however, this similarity in molecular attributes did not translate into the 
predicted subtype-related clinical outcomes (i.e., death event). (4) To further 
elucidate the molecular basis of CRC prognosis, we developed a new 
stratification strategy based on miRNA-mRNA-associated subtyping (MMAS) and 
consequently showed that repressed WNT signaling activity is associated with 
poor prognosis in Taiwanese CRC. In summary, our findings of distinct, hitherto 
unreported biosignatures underscore the heterogeneity of CRC tumorigenesis, 
support our hypothesis of an ethnic basis of disease, and provide prospects for 
translational medicine.

The Ebola virus is a human aggressive pathogen causes Ebola virus disease that 
threatens public health, for which there is no Food Drug Administration approved 
medication. Drug repurposing is an alternative method to find the novel 
indications of known drugs to treat the disease effectively at low cost. The 
present work focused on understanding the host-virus interaction as well as host 
virus drug interaction to identify the disease pathways and host-directed drug 
targets. Thus, existing direct physical Ebola-human protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) was collected from various publicly available databases and also 
literature through manual curation. Further, the functional and pathway 
enrichment analysis for the proteins were performed using database for 
annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery and the enriched gene 
ontology biological process terms includes chromatin assembly or disassembly, 
nucleosome organization, nucleosome assembly. Also, the enriched Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway terms includes systemic lupus 
erythematosus, alcoholism, and viral carcinogenesis. From the PPI network, 
important large histone clusters and tubulin were observed. Further, the 
host-virus and host-virus-drug interaction network has been generated and found 
that 182 drugs are associated with 45 host genes. The obtained drugs and their 
interacting targets could be considered for Ebola treatment.

The aim of the present study was to identify potential therapeutic targets that 
serve crucial roles in the progression of cervical cancer. Clinical data, RNA 
sequencing (RNAseq)-counts and micro (mi)RNA data regarding cervical squamous 
cell carcinoma were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and analyses were 
performed using the University of California Santa Cruz database. RNAseq and 
miRNA data were stratified into 3 groups (according to the patients' age), and 
genes were re-annotated and preprocessed prior to Mfuzz time clustering 
analysis. Subsequently, enrichment analyses were performed in order to identify 
differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and a protein-protein interaction 
analysis network was constructed. miRNA-gene, miRNA-lncRNA, and long non-coding 
(lnc)RNA-mRNA pairs were collected and the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing 
endogenous (ce)RNA network was established. Further enrichment analyses were 
performed in order to identify crucial mRNAs in the ceRNA network. Finally, 
survival and drug association analyses were implemented. A total of 269 DEmRNAs 
[including alcohol dehydrogenase 7 (ADH7), vestigial-like family member 3 
(VGLL3) and cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP26B1)], 
274 DElncRNAs (including LINC01133) and 16 DEmiRNAs (including miR-3065 and 
miR-330) were identified. There were 102 lncRNAs, 15 miRNAs, 15 mRNAs and 522 
interaction pairs in the ceRNA network. In particular, ADH7 was regulated by 
miR-3065, and miR-3065 interacted with LINC01133 in the ceRNA network. 
Furthermore, ADH7 and CYP26B1 were enriched in the retinoic acid metabolic 
process and the retinol metabolism pathway. ADH7 and VGLL3 were significantly 
associated with the cervical cancer survival rate. ADH7, VGLL3, CYP26B1, 
miR-3065, miR-330, miR-499a and LINC01133 play pivotal roles in the progression 
of cervical cancer in different age groups.

MOTIVATION: Evolution of cancer is driven by few somatic mutations that disrupt 
cellular processes, causing abnormal proliferation and tumor development, 
whereas most somatic mutations have no impact on progression. Distinguishing 
those mutated genes that drive tumorigenesis in a patient is a primary goal in 
cancer therapy: Knowledge of these genes and the pathways on which they operate 
can illuminate disease mechanisms and indicate potential therapies and drug 
targets. Current research focuses mainly on cohort-level driver gene 
identification but patient-specific driver gene identification remains a 
challenge.
METHODS: We developed a new algorithm for patient-specific ranking of driver 
genes. The algorithm, called PRODIGY, analyzes the expression and mutation 
profiles of the patient along with data on known pathways and protein-protein 
interactions. Prodigy quantifies the impact of each mutated gene on every 
deregulated pathway using the prize-collecting Steiner tree model. Mutated genes 
are ranked by their aggregated impact on all deregulated pathways.
RESULTS: In testing on five TCGA cancer cohorts spanning >2500 patients and 
comparison to validated driver genes, Prodigy outperformed extant methods and 
ranking based on network centrality measures. Our results pinpoint the 
pleiotropic effect of driver genes and show that Prodigy is capable of 
identifying even very rare drivers. Hence, Prodigy takes a step further toward 
personalized medicine and treatment.

SUMMARY: Cancer hallmarks rely on its specific transcriptional programs, which 
are dysregulated by multiple mechanisms, including genomic aberrations in the 
DNA regulatory regions. Genome-wide association studies have shown many variants 
are found within putative enhancer elements. To provide insights into the 
regulatory role of enhancer-associated non-coding variants in cancer epigenome, 
and to facilitate the identification of functional non-coding mutations, we 
present dbInDel, a database where we have comprehensively analyzed 
enhancer-associated insertion and deletion variants for both human and murine 
samples using ChIP-Seq data. Moreover, we provide the identification and 
visualization of upstream TF binding motifs in InDel-containing enhancers. 
Downstream target genes are also predicted and analyzed in the context of cancer 
biology. The dbInDel database promotes the investigation of functional 
contributions of non-coding variants in cancer epigenome.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The database, dbInDel, can be accessed from 
http://enhancer-indel.cam-su.org/.

We undertook a comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of 95 prospectively 
collected endometrial carcinomas, comprising 83 endometrioid and 12 serous 
tumors. This analysis revealed possible new consequences of perturbations to the 
p53 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, identified a potential role for circRNAs in the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and provided new information about proteomic 
markers of clinical and genomic tumor subgroups, including relationships to 
known druggable pathways. An extensive genome-wide acetylation survey yielded 
insights into regulatory mechanisms linking Wnt signaling and histone 
acetylation. We also characterized aspects of the tumor immune landscape, 
including immunogenic alterations, neoantigens, common cancer/testis antigens, 
and the immune microenvironment, all of which can inform immunotherapy 
decisions. Collectively, our multi-omic analyses provide a valuable resource for 
researchers and clinicians, identify new molecular associations of potential 
mechanistic significance in the development of endometrial cancers, and suggest 
novel approaches for identifying potential therapeutic targets.

Identifying cancer drivers and actionable mutations is critical for precision 
oncology. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) the majority of mutations lack 
biological or clinical validation. We fully characterized 43 lines of 
Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) and performed copy number analysis and whole 
exome sequencing of 12 lines derived from naïve, high grade EOCs. Pyrosequencing 
allowed quantifying mutations in the source tumours. Drug response was assayed 
on PDX Derived Tumour Cells (PDTCs) and in vivo on PDXs. We identified a 
PIK3R1W624R variant in PDXs from a high grade serous EOC. Allele frequencies of 
PIK3R1W624R in all the passaged PDXs and in samples of the source tumour 
suggested that it was truncal and thus possibly a driver mutation. After 
inconclusive results in silico analyses, PDTCs and PDXs allowed the showing 
actionability of PIK3R1W624R and addiction of PIK3R1W624R carrying cells to 
inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. It is noteworthy that PIK3R1 encodes 
the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K, that is very rarely mutated in EOC. The 
PIK3R1W624R mutation is located in the cSH2 domain of the p85α that has never 
been involved in oncogenesis. These data show that patient-derived models are 
irreplaceable in their role of unveiling unpredicted driver and actionable 
variants in advanced ovarian cancer.

HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) develop in 
precancerous changes in the mucosal lining of the upper-aerodigestive tract. 
These precancerous cells contain cancer-associated genomic changes and cause 
primary tumors and local relapses. Therapeutic strategies to eradicate these 
precancerous cells are very limited. Using functional genomic screens, we 
identified the therapeutic vulnerabilities of premalignant mucosal cells, which 
are shared with fully malignant HNSCC cells. We screened 319 previously 
identified tumor-lethal siRNAs on a panel of cancer and precancerous cell lines 
as well as primary fibroblasts. In total we identified 147 tumor-essential genes 
including 34 druggable candidates. Of these 34, 13 were also essential in 
premalignant cells. We investigated the variable molecular basis of the 
vulnerabilities in tumor and premalignant cell lines and found indications of 
collateral lethality. Wee1-like kinase (WEE1) was amongst the most promising 
targets for both tumor and precancerous cells. All four precancerous cell lines 
were highly sensitive to Wee1 inhibition by Adavosertib (AZD1775), while primary 
keratinocytes tolerated this inhibitor. Wee1 inhibition caused induction of DNA 
damage during S-phase followed by mitotic failure in (pre)cancer cells. In 
conclusion, we uncovered Wee1 inhibition as a promising chemopreventive strategy 
for precancerous cells, with comparable responses as fully transformed HNSCC 
cells.

Preterm birth and postpartum hemorrhage are the leading causes of neonatal and 
maternal morbidities worldwide, respectively. Current clinically utilized 
tocolytics and uterotonics to manage these obstetric conditions are limited due 
to their off-target effects and/or lack of efficacy. Thus, an ideal tocolytic or 
uterotonic would be uterine-selective with rapid onset and long-duration 
efficacy. Here, we discuss strategies for the discovery of new therapeutic 
targets and compounds that regulate uterine contractility with the 
aforementioned properties.

BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that harbors activating mutations in ∼7% of 
human malignancies and ∼60% of melanomas. Despite initial clinical responses to 
BRAF inhibitors, patients frequently develop drug resistance. To identify 
candidate therapeutic targets for BRAF inhibitor resistant melanoma, we conduct 
CRISPR screens in melanoma cells harboring an activating BRAF mutation that had 
also acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. To investigate the mechanisms and 
pathways enabling resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanomas, we integrate 
expression, ATAC-seq, and CRISPR screen data. We identify the JUN family 
transcription factors and the ETS family transcription factor ETV5 as key 
regulators of CDK6, which together enable resistance to BRAF inhibitors in 
melanoma cells. Our findings reveal genes contributing to resistance to a 
selective BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, providing new insights into gene regulation in 
BRAF inhibitor resistant melanoma cells.

PURPOSE: The analysis of cancer biology data involves extremely heterogeneous 
data sets, including information from RNA sequencing, genome-wide copy number, 
DNA methylation data reporting on epigenetic regulation, somatic mutations from 
whole-exome or whole-genome analyses, pathology estimates from imaging sections 
or subtyping, drug response or other treatment outcomes, and various other 
clinical and phenotypic measurements. Bringing these different resources into a 
common framework, with a data model that allows for complex relationships as 
well as dense vectors of features, will unlock integrated data set analysis.
METHODS: We introduce the BioMedical Evidence Graph (BMEG), a graph database and 
query engine for discovery and analysis of cancer biology. The BMEG is unique 
from other biologic data graphs in that sample-level molecular and clinical 
information is connected to reference knowledge bases. It combines gene 
expression and mutation data with drug-response experiments, pathway information 
databases, and literature-derived associations.
RESULTS: The construction of the BMEG has resulted in a graph containing > 41 
million vertices and 57 million edges. The BMEG system provides a graph 
query-based application programming interface to enable analysis, with client 
code available for Python, Javascript, and R, and a server online at bmeg.io. 
Using this system, we have demonstrated several forms of cross-data set analysis 
to show the utility of the system.
CONCLUSION: The BMEG is an evolving resource dedicated to enabling integrative 
analysis. We have demonstrated queries on the system that illustrate mutation 
significance analysis, drug-response machine learning, patient-level 
knowledge-base queries, and pathway level analysis. We have compared the 
resulting graph to other available integrated graph systems and demonstrated the 
former is unique in the scale of the graph and the type of data it makes 
available.

The severity of symptoms as well as efficacy of antidepressants in major 
depressive disorder (MDD) is modified by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
in different genes, which may contribute in an additive or synergistic fashion. 
We aimed to investigate depression severity in participants with MDD under 
treatment with antidepressants in relation to the combinatory effect of selected 
genetic variants combined using a genetic risk score (GRS). The sample included 
150 MDD patients on regular AD therapy from the population-based Swiss PsyCoLaus 
cohort. We investigated 44 SNPs previously associated with antidepressant 
response by ranking them with regard to their association to the Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D) score using random forest. 
The three top scoring SNPs (rs12248560, rs878567, rs17710780) were subsequently 
combined into an unweighted GRS, which was included in linear and logistic 
regression models using the CES-D score, occurrence of a major depressive 
episode (MDE) during follow-up and regular antidepressant treatment during the 6 
months preceding follow-up assessment as outcomes. The GRS was associated with 
MDE occurrence (p = .02) and ln CES-D score (p = .001). The HTR1A rs878567 
variant was associated with ln CES-D after adjustment for demographic and 
clinical variables [p = .02, lower scores for minor allele (G) carriers]. 
Additionally, rs12248560 (CYP2C19) CC homozygotes showed a six-fold higher 
likelihood of regular AD therapy at follow-up compared to minor allele 
homozygotes [TT; ultrarapid metabolizers (p = .03)]. Our study suggests that the 
cumulative consideration of pharmacogenetic risk variants more reliably reflects 
the impact of the genetic background on depression severity than individual 
SNPs.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common cancer types, 
threatening the human health around the world. However, the high heterogeneity 
and complexity of LUAD limit the benefits of targeted therapies. This study 
aimed to identify the key prognosis impacting genes and relevant subtypes for 
LUAD.
METHODS: We recognized significant mutations and prognosis-relevant genes based 
on the omics data of 515 LUAD samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Mutation 
significance was estimated by MutSigCV. Prognosis analysis was based on the cox 
proportional hazards regression (Coxph) model. Specifically, the Coxph model was 
combined with a causal regulatory network to help reveal which genes play master 
roles among numerous prognosis impacting genes. Based on expressional profiles 
of the master genes, LUAD patients were clustered into different sub-types by a 
consensus clustering method and the importance of master genes were further 
evaluated by random forest.
RESULTS: Significant mutations did not influence the prognosis directly. 
However, a collection of prognosis relevant genes were recognized, where 75 
genes like GAPDH and GGA2 which are involved in mTOR signaling, lysosome or 
other key pathways are further identified as the master ones. Interestingly, the 
master gene expressions help separate LUAD patients into two sub-types 
displaying remarkable differences in expressional profiles, prognostic outcomes 
and genomic mutations in certain genes, like SMARCA4 and COL11A1. Meanwhile, the 
subtypes were re-discovered from two additional LUAD cohorts based on the top-10 
important master genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study can promote precision treatment of LUAD by providing a 
comprehensive description on the key prognosis-relevant genes and an alternative 
way to classify LUAD subtypes.

BACKGROUND: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are three serious pulmonary diseases that contain 
common and unique characteristics. Therefore, the identification of biomarkers 
that differentiate these diseases is of importance for preventing misdiagnosis. 
In this regard, the present study aimed to identify the disorders at the early 
stages, based on lung transcriptomics data and drug-target interactions.
METHODS: To this end, the differentially expressed genes were found in each 
disease. Then, WGCNA was utilized to find specific and consensus gene modules 
among the three diseases. Finally, the disease-disease similarity was analyzed, 
followed by determining candidate drug-target interactions.
RESULTS: The results confirmed that the asthma lung transcriptome was more 
similar to COPD than IPF. In addition, the biomarkers were found in each disease 
and thus were proposed for further clinical validations. These genes included 
RBM42, STX5, and TRIM41 in asthma, CYP27A1, GM2A, LGALS9, SPI1, and NLRC4 in 
COPD, ATF3, PPP1R15A, ZFP36, SOCS3, NAMPT, and GADD45B in IPF, LRRC48 and CETN2 
in asthma-COPD, COL15A1, GIMAP6, and JAM2 in asthma-IPF and LMO7, TSPAN13, 
LAMA3, and ANXA3 in COPD-IPF. Finally, analyzing drug-target networks suggested 
anti-inflammatory candidate drugs for treating the above mentioned diseases.
CONCLUSION: In general, the results revealed the unique and common biomarkers 
among three chronic lung diseases. Eventually, some drugs were suggested for 
treatment purposes.

Identifying and evaluating the right target are the most important factors in 
early drug discovery phase. Most studies focus on one protein ignoring the 
multiple splice-variant or protein-isoforms, which might contribute to 
unexpected therapeutic activity or adverse side effects. Here, we present 
computational analysis of cancer drug-target interactions affected by 
alternative splicing. By integrating information from publicly available 
databases, we curated 883 FDA approved or investigational stage small molecule 
cancer drugs that target 1,434 different genes, with an average of 5.22 protein 
isoforms per gene. Of these, 618 genes have ≥5 annotated protein-isoforms. By 
analyzing the interactions with binding pocket information, we found that 76% of 
drugs either miss a potential target isoform or target other isoforms with 
varied expression in multiple normal tissues. We present sequence and structure 
level alignments at isoform-level and make this information publicly available 
for all the curated drugs. Structure-level analysis showed ligand binding pocket 
architectures differences in size, shape and electrostatic parameters between 
isoforms. Our results emphasize how potentially important isoform-level 
interactions could be missed by solely focusing on the canonical isoform, and 
suggest that on- and off-target effects at isoform-level should be investigated 
to enhance the productivity of drug-discovery research.

Comprehensive genomic analyses of cancers have revealed substantial intrapatient 
molecular heterogeneities that may explain some instances of drug resistance and 
treatment failures. Examination of the clonal composition of an individual tumor 
and its evolution through disease progression and treatment may enable 
identification of precise therapeutic targets for drug design. Multi-region and 
single-cell sequencing are powerful tools that can be used to capture intratumor 
heterogeneity. Here, we present a database we've named CancerTracer 
(http://cailab.labshare.cn/cancertracer): a manually curated database designed 
to track and characterize the evolutionary trajectories of tumor growth in 
individual patients. We collected over 6000 tumor samples from 1548 patients 
corresponding to 45 different types of cancer. Patient-specific tumor 
phylogenetic trees were constructed based on somatic mutations or copy number 
alterations identified in multiple biopsies. Using the structured heterogeneity 
data, researchers can identify common driver events shared by all tumor regions, 
and the heterogeneous somatic events present in different regions of a tumor of 
interest. The database can also be used to investigate the phylogenetic 
relationships between primary and metastatic tumors. It is our hope that 
CancerTracer will significantly improve our understanding of the evolutionary 
histories of tumors, and may facilitate the identification of predictive 
biomarkers for personalized cancer therapies.

De novo mutations (DNMs) significantly contribute to sporadic diseases, 
particularly in neuropsychiatric disorders. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and 
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provide effective methods for detecting DNMs and 
prioritizing candidate genes. However, it remains a challenge for scientists, 
clinicians, and biologists to conveniently access and analyse data regarding 
DNMs and candidate genes from scattered publications. To fill the unmet need, we 
integrated 580 799 DNMs, including 30 060 coding DNMs detected by WES/WGS from 
23 951 individuals across 24 phenotypes and prioritized a list of candidate 
genes with different degrees of statistical evidence, including 346 genes with 
false discovery rates <0.05. We then developed a database called Gene4Denovo 
(http://www.genemed.tech/gene4denovo/), which allowed these genetic data to be 
conveniently catalogued, searched, browsed, and analysed. In addition, 
Gene4Denovo integrated data from >60 genomic sources to provide comprehensive 
variant-level and gene-level annotation and information regarding the DNMs and 
candidate genes. Furthermore, Gene4Denovo provides end-users with limited 
bioinformatics skills to analyse their own genetic data, perform comprehensive 
annotation, and prioritize candidate genes using custom parameters. In 
conclusion, Gene4Denovo conveniently allows for the accelerated interpretation 
of DNM pathogenicity and the clinical implication of DNMs in humans.

Mutation-specific effects of cancer driver genes influence drug responses and 
the success of clinical trials. We reasoned that these effects could unbalance 
the distribution of each mutation across different cancer types, as a result, 
the cancer preference can be used to distinguish the effects of the causal 
mutation. Here, we developed a network-based framework to systematically measure 
cancer diversity for each driver mutation. We found that half of the driver 
genes harbor cancer type-specific and pancancer mutations simultaneously, 
suggesting that the pervasive functional heterogeneity of the mutations from 
even the same driver gene. We further demonstrated that the specificity of the 
mutations could influence patient drug responses. Moreover, we observed that 
diversity was generally increased in advanced tumors. Finally, we scanned 
potentially novel cancer driver genes based on the diversity spectrum. Diversity 
spectrum analysis provides a new approach to define driver mutations and 
optimize off-label clinical trials.

Small cell carcinoma of the bladder (SCCB) is a rare and lethal phenotype of 
bladder cancer. The pathogenesis and molecular features are unknown. Here, we 
established a genetically engineered SCCB model and a cohort of patient SCCB and 
urothelial carcinoma samples to characterize molecular similarities and 
differences between bladder cancer phenotypes. We demonstrate that SCCB shares a 
urothelial origin with other bladder cancer phenotypes by showing that 
urothelial cells driven by a set of defined oncogenic factors give rise to a 
mixture of tumor phenotypes, including small cell carcinoma, urothelial 
carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Tumor-derived single-cell clones also 
give rise to both SCCB and urothelial carcinoma in xenografts. Despite this 
shared urothelial origin, clinical SCCB samples have a distinct transcriptional 
profile and a unique transcriptional regulatory network. Using the 
transcriptional profile from our cohort, we identified cell surface proteins 
(CSPs) associated with the SCCB phenotype. We found that the majority of SCCB 
samples have PD-L1 expression in both tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes, suggesting that immune checkpoint inhibitors could be a treatment 
option for SCCB. We further demonstrate that our genetically engineered tumor 
model is a representative tool for investigating CSPs in SCCB by showing that it 
shares a similar a CSP profile with clinical samples and expresses 
SCCB-up-regulated CSPs at both the mRNA and protein levels. Our findings reveal 
distinct molecular features of SCCB and provide a transcriptional dataset and a 
preclinical model for further investigating SCCB biology.

As expenditure on drug development increases exponentially, the overall drug 
discovery process requires a sustainable revolution. Since artificial 
intelligence (AI) is leading the fourth industrial revolution, AI can be 
considered as a viable solution for unstable drug research and development. 
Generally, AI is applied to fields with sufficient data such as computer vision 
and natural language processing, but there are many efforts to revolutionize the 
existing drug discovery process by applying AI. This review provides a 
comprehensive, organized summary of the recent research trends in AI-guided drug 
discovery process including target identification, hit identification, ADMET 
prediction, lead optimization, and drug repositioning. The main data sources in 
each field are also summarized in this review. In addition, an in-depth analysis 
of the remaining challenges and limitations will be provided, and proposals for 
promising future directions in each of the aforementioned areas.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive cancer 
types in China. In recent years, progress has been made in various types of 
cancer genomics including ESCC. However, the clinical significance of genomic 
variation of ESCC remains poorly defined. In the present study, genomic 
sequencing data from 469 ESCC cases were analyzed and potential therapeutic 
targets in the Druggable Genome Interaction Database (DGIdb) were screened. A 
series of potential therapeutic target genes and pathways were identified, of 
which treatment of ESCC with bortezomib (a specific inhibitor targeting 
proteasome) potently inhibited the proliferation of 5 ESCC cell lines and 
administration of bortezomib led to significant tumor xenograft regression in 
SCID mice. It was also identified that kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), 
which had drug recommendations from all 6 sources integrated by the DGldb and 
harbored significant amplification in ESCC, might be a downstream target of zinc 
finger protein 750 (ZNF750). ZNF750 acts as a transcription factor and has been 
demonstrated to harbor frequently inactivating mutations in ESCC by previous 
independent studies. In the present study, KDR was upregulated upon ZNF750 
knockdown and the rescue of ZNF750 also led to marked restoration of KDR. KDR 
knockdown in stable ZNF750-knockdown KYSE150 and KYSE140 ESCC cells 
significantly attenuated the promotion of cell growth, colony formation, 
invasion and migration induced by ZNF750 knockdown. Further experiments found 
that apatinib treatment, a potent inhibitor of KDR, resulted in profound 
inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion. Collectively, the present study 
provided insight for genomic alterations as potential therapeutic targets in 
ESCC and supported the possibility of a therapeutic strategy targeting the 
proteasome in ESCC. The present results also suggested that targeting KDR may be 
an effective way to treat ESCC, not only in KDR variant cases, but also in 
individuals with ZNF750 mutations and deletions.

Genomic techniques such as next-generation sequencing and microarrays have 
facilitated the identification and classification of molecular signatures 
inherent in cells upon viral infection, for possible therapeutic targets. 
Therefore, in this study, we performed a differential gene expression analysis, 
pathway enrichment analysis, and gene ontology on RNAseq data obtained from 
SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 cells. Differential expression analysis revealed that 
753 genes were up-regulated while 746 down-regulated. SNORA81, OAS2, SYCP2, 
LOC100506985, and SNORD35B are the top 5 upregulated genes upon SARS-Cov-2 
infection. Expectedly, these genes have been implicated in the immune response 
to viral assaults. In the Ontology of protein classification, a high percentage 
of the genes are classified as Gene-specific transcriptional regulator, 
metabolite interconversion enzyme, and Protein modifying enzymes. Twenty 
pathways with P-value lower than 0.05 were enriched in the up-regulated genes 
while 18 pathways are enriched in the down-regulated DEGs. The toll-like 
receptor signalling pathway is one of the major pathways enriched. This pathway 
plays an important role in the innate immune system by identifying the 
pathogen-associated molecular signature emanating from various microorganisms. 
Taken together, our results present a novel understanding of genes and 
corresponding pathways upon SARS-Cov-2 infection, and could facilitate the 
identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers in the treatment of 
COVID-19.

Gastric adenocarcinoma is a highly aggressive disease with poor overall 
survival. The aggressive nature of this disease is in part due to the high intra 
and inter tumoral heterogeneity and also due to the late diagnosis at 
presentation. Once progression occurs, treatment is more difficult due to the 
adaptation of tumors, which acquires resistance to commonly used 
chemotherapeutics. In this report, using publicly available data sets and 
pathway analysis, we highlight the vast heterogeneity of gastric cancer by 
investigating genes found to be significantly perturbed. We found several 
upregulated genes in the diffuse gastric cancer subtypes share similarity to 
gastric cancer as a whole which can be explained by the increase in this subtype 
of gastric cancer throughout the world. We report significant downregulation of 
genes that are underrepresented within the literature, such as ADH7, GCNT2, and 
LIF1, while other genes have not been explored within gastric cancer to the best 
of our knowledge such as METTL7A, MAL, CWD43, and SLC2A12. We identified gender 
to be another heterogeneous component of this disease and suggested targeted 
treatment strategies specific to this heterogeneity. In this study, we provide 
an in-depth exploration of the molecular landscape of gastric cancer in order to 
shed light onto novel areas of gastric cancer research and explore potential new 
therapeutic targets.

This study was designed to identify novel circular RNAs and the related 
regulatory axis to provide research targets for the diagnosis and treatment of 
breast cancer. The circular RNA expression microarray "GSE101123" related to 
breast cancer was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The 
differentially expressed circular RNAs between tumor and normal samples were 
screened using Limma package. The targeted microRNAs of the differentially 
expressed circular RNAs and the targeted messenger RNAs of the microRNAs were 
predicted using miRanda and miRWalk, respectively, and a circular 
RNAs-microRNAs-messenger RNAs network was constructed. Then, functional 
enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network construction, and 
drug-gene interaction analysis were conducted for the messenger RNAs. A total of 
11 differentially expressed circular RNAs were identified between the breast 
cancer and normal samples, of which 3 were upregulated, while 8 were 
downregulated. The circular RNA-microRNA-messenger RNA network contained 1 
circular RNA (hsa_circ_0000376), 2 microRNAs (miR-1285-3p and miR-1286), and 353 
messenger RNAs. The protein-protein interaction network contained 150 nodes and 
240 interactions. The hub genes in the protein-protein interaction network were 
all targeted messenger RNAs of miR-1285-3p that were significantly enriched in 
the ubiquitin-proteasome system, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest-related pathways, 
and cancer-related pathways involving SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 
1, β-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, tumor protein P53 
among others. Twenty-two drugs were predicted to target 4 messenger RNAs, 
including tumor protein P53. A novel circular RNA, hsa_circ_0000376, was 
identified in breast cancer that may act as a sponge targeting miR-1285-3p 
expression which through its target genes, SMURF1, BTRC, and TP53, may further 
regulate tumorigenesis.

PURPOSE: In this work, we introduce CDGnet (Cancer-Drug-Gene Network), an 
evidence-based network approach for recommending targeted cancer therapies. 
CDGnet represents a user-friendly informatics tool that expands the range of 
targeted therapy options for patients with cancer who undergo molecular 
profiling by including the biologic context via pathway information.
METHODS: CDGnet considers biologic pathway information specifically by looking 
at targets or biomarkers downstream of oncogenes and is personalized for 
individual patients via user-inputted molecular alterations and cancer type. It 
integrates a number of different sources of knowledge: patient-specific inputs 
(molecular alterations and cancer type), US Food and Drug 
Administration-approved therapies and biomarkers (curated from DailyMed), 
pathways for specific cancer types (from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
[KEGG]), gene-drug connections (from DrugBank), and oncogene information (from 
KEGG). We consider 4 different evidence-based categories for therapy 
recommendations. Our tool is delivered via an R/Shiny Web application. For the 2 
categories that use pathway information, we include an interactive Sankey 
visualization built on top of d3.js that also provides links to PubChem.
RESULTS: We present a scenario for a patient who has estrogen receptor 
(ER)-positive breast cancer with FGFR1 amplification. Although many therapies 
exist for patients with ER-positive breast cancer, FGFR1 amplifications may 
confer resistance to such treatments. CDGnet provides therapy recommendations, 
including PIK3CA, MAPK, and RAF inhibitors, by considering targets or biomarkers 
downstream of FGFR1.
CONCLUSION: CDGnet provides results in a number of easily accessible and usable 
forms, separating targeted cancer therapies into categories in an evidence-based 
manner that incorporates biologic pathway information.

One in five Americans experience mental illness, and roughly 75% of psychiatric 
prescriptions do not successfully treat the patient's condition. Extensive 
evidence implicates genetic factors and signaling disruption in the 
pathophysiology of these diseases. Changes in transcription often underlie this 
molecular pathway dysregulation; individual patient transcriptional data can 
improve the efficacy of diagnosis and treatment. Recent large-scale genomic 
studies have uncovered shared genetic modules across multiple psychiatric 
disorders - providing an opportunity for an integrated multi-disease approach 
for diagnosis. Moreover, network-based models informed by gene expression can 
represent pathological biological mechanisms and suggest new genes for diagnosis 
and treatment. Here, we use patient gene expression data from multiple studies 
to classify psychiatric diseases, integrate knowledge from expert-curated 
databases and publicly available experimental data to create augmented 
disease-specific gene sets, and use these to recommend disease-relevant drugs. 
From Gene Expression Omnibus, we extract expression data from 145 cases of 
schizophrenia, 82 cases of bipolar disorder, 190 cases of major depressive 
disorder, and 307 shared controls. We use pathway-based approaches to predict 
psychiatric disease diagnosis with a random forest model (78% accuracy) and 
derive important features to augment available drug and disease signatures. 
Using protein-protein-interaction networks and embedding-based methods, we build 
a pipeline to prioritize treatments for psychiatric diseases that achieves a 
3.4-fold improvement over a background model. Thus, we demonstrate that 
gene-expression-derived pathway features can diagnose psychiatric diseases and 
that molecular insights derived from this classification task can inform 
treatment prioritization for psychiatric diseases.

Millions of Americans are affected by rare diseases, many of which have poor 
survival rates. However, the small market size of individual rare diseases, 
combined with the time and capital requirements of pharmaceutical R&D, have 
hindered the development of new drugs for these cases. A promising alternative 
is drug repurposing, whereby existing FDA-approved drugs might be used to treat 
diseases different from their original indications. In order to generate drug 
repurposing hypotheses in a systematic and comprehensive fashion, it is 
essential to integrate information from across the literature of pharmacology, 
genetics, and pathology. To this end, we leverage a newly developed knowledge 
graph, the Global Network of Biomedical Relationships (GNBR). GNBR is a large, 
heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising drug, disease, and gene (or protein) 
entities linked by a small set of semantic themes derived from the abstracts of 
biomedical literature. We apply a knowledge graph embedding method that 
explicitly models the uncertainty associated with literature-derived 
relationships and uses link prediction to generate drug repurposing hypotheses. 
This approach achieves high performance on a gold-standard test set of known 
drug indications (AUROC = 0.89) and is capable of generating novel repurposing 
hypotheses, which we independently validate using external literature sources 
and protein interaction networks. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our 
model to produce explanations of its predictions.

The first wave of genetically targeted therapies for cancer focused on drugging 
gene products that are recurrently mutated in specific cancer types. However, 
mutational analysis of tumours has largely been exhausted as a strategy for the 
identification of new cancer targets that are druggable with conventional 
approaches. Furthermore, some known genetic drivers of cancer have not been 
directly targeted yet owing to their molecular structure (undruggable oncogenes) 
or because they result in functional loss (tumour suppressor genes). Functional 
genomic screening based on the genetic concept of synthetic lethality provides 
an avenue to discover drug targets in all these areas. Although synthetic 
lethality is not a new idea, recent advances, including CRISPR-based gene 
editing, have made possible systematic screens for synthetic lethal drug targets 
in human cancers. Such approaches have broad potential to drive the discovery of 
the next wave of genetic cancer targets and ultimately the introduction of 
effective medicines that are still needed for most cancers.

BACKGROUND: Although there are huge volumes of genomic data, how to decipher 
them and identify driver events is still a challenge. The current methods based 
on network typically use the relationship between genomic events and consequent 
changes in gene expression to nominate putative driver genes. But there may 
exist some relationships within the transcriptional network.
METHODS: We developed MECoRank, a novel method that improves the recognition 
accuracy of driver genes. MECoRank is based on bipartite graph to propagates the 
scores via an iterative process. After iteration, we will obtain a ranked gene 
list for each patient sample. Then, we applied the Condorcet voting method to 
determine the most impactful drivers in a population.
RESULTS: We applied MECoRank to three cancer datasets to reveal candidate driver 
genes which have a greater impact on gene expression. Experimental results show 
that our method not only can identify more driver genes that have been validated 
than other methods, but also can recognize some impactful novel genes which have 
been proved to be more important in literature.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel approach named MECoRank to prioritize driver 
genes based on their impact on the expression in the molecular interaction 
network. This method not only assesses mutation's effect on the transcriptional 
network, but also assesses the differential expression's effect within the 
transcriptional network. And the results demonstrated that MECoRank has better 
performance than the other competing approaches in identifying driver genes.

BACKGROUND: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is originated in the muscle 
wall of the bladder, and is the ninth most common malignancy worldwide. However, 
there are no reliable, accurate and robust gene signatures for MIBC prognosis 
prediction, which is of the importance in assisting oncologists to make a more 
accurate evaluation in clinical practice.
METHODS: This study used univariable and multivariable Cox regression models to 
select gene signatures and build risk prediction model, respectively. The t-test 
and fold change methods were used to perform the differential expression 
analysis. The hypergeometric test was used to test the enrichment of the 
differentially expressed genes in GO terms or KEGG pathways.
RESULTS: In the present study, we identified three prognostic genes, KLK6, TNS1, 
and TRIM56, as the best subset of genes for muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
(MIBC) risk prediction. The validation of this stratification method on two 
datasets demonstrated that the stratified patients exhibited significant 
difference in overall survival, and our stratification was superior to three 
other stratifications. Consistently, the high-risk group exhibited worse 
prognosis than low-risk group in samples with and without lymph node metastasis, 
distant metastasis, and radiation treatment. Moreover, the upregulated genes in 
high-risk MIBC were significantly enriched in several cancer-related pathways. 
Notably, PDGFRB, a receptor for platelet-derived growth factor of PI3K-Akt 
signaling pathway, and TUBA1A were identified as two targets of multiple drugs. 
In addition, the angiogenesis-related genes, as well as two marker genes of M2 
macrophage, CD163 and MRC1, were highly upregulated in high-risk MIBC.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study investigated the underlying molecular 
mechanism and potential therapeutic targets associated with worse prognosis of 
high-risk MIBC, which could improve our understanding of progression of MIBC and 
provide new therapeutic strategies for the MIBC patients.

Manually curated variant knowledgebases and their associated knowledge models 
are serving an increasingly important role in distributing and interpreting 
variants in cancer. These knowledgebases vary in their level of public 
accessibility, and the complexity of the models used to capture clinical 
knowledge. CIViC (Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer - 
www.civicdb.org) is a fully open, free-to-use cancer variant interpretation 
knowledgebase that incorporates highly detailed curation of evidence obtained 
from peer-reviewed publications and meeting abstracts, and currently holds over 
6300 Evidence Items for over 2300 variants derived from over 400 genes. CIViC 
has seen increased adoption by, and also undertaken collaboration with, a wide 
range of users and organizations involved in research. To enhance CIViC's 
clinical value, regular submission to the ClinVar database and pursuit of other 
regulatory approvals is necessary. For this reason, a formal peer reviewed 
curation guideline and discussion of the underlying principles of curation is 
needed. We present here the CIViC knowledge model, standard operating procedures 
(SOP) for variant curation, and detailed examples to support community-driven 
curation of cancer variants.

Resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-targeted therapy in ALK-positive 
non-small cell lung cancer has been reported, with the majority of acquired 
resistance mechanisms relying on bypass signaling. To proactively identify 
resistance mechanisms in ALK-positive neuroblastoma (NB), we herein employ 
genome-wide CRISPR activation screens of NB cell lines treated with brigatinib 
or ceritinib, identifying PIM1 as a putative resistance gene, whose high 
expression is associated with high-risk disease and poor survival. Knockdown of 
PIM1 sensitizes cells of differing MYCN status to ALK inhibitors, and in 
patient-derived xenografts of high-risk NB harboring ALK mutations, the 
combination of the ALK inhibitor ceritinib and PIM1 inhibitor AZD1208 shows 
significantly enhanced anti-tumor efficacy relative to single agents. These data 
confirm that PIM1 overexpression decreases sensitivity to ALK inhibitors in NB, 
and suggests that combined front-line inhibition of ALK and PIM1 is a viable 
strategy for the treatment of ALK-positive NB independent of MYCN status.

The causes of a disease and its therapies are not only related to genotypes, but 
also associated with other factors, including phenotypes, environmental 
exposures, drugs and chemical molecules. Distinguishing disease-related factors 
from many neutral factors is critical as well as difficult. Over the past two 
decades, bioinformaticians have developed many computational resources to 
integrate the omics data and discover associations among these factors. However, 
researchers and clinicians are experiencing difficulties in choosing appropriate 
resources from hundreds of relevant databases and software tools. Here, in order 
to assist the researchers and clinicians, we systematically review the public 
computational resources of human diseases related to genotypes, phenotypes, 
environment factors, drugs and chemical exposures. We briefly describe the 
development history of these computational resources, followed by the details of 
the relevant databases and software tools. We finally conclude with a discussion 
of current challenges and future opportunities as well as prospects on this 
topic.

Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) show higher frequency of obesity and type 2 
diabetes (T2D), but the underlying genetic determinants and molecular pathways 
are not well studied. Using large publicly available datasets, we (1) conducted 
a gene-based analysis using MAGMA to identify genes associated with BD and body 
mass index (BMI) or T2D and investigated their functional enrichment; and (2) 
performed two meta-analyses between BD and BMI, as well as BD and T2D using 
Metasoft. Target druggability was assessed using the Drug Gene Interaction 
Database (DGIdb). We identified 518 and 390 genes significantly associated with 
BD and BMI or BD and T2D, respectively. A total of 52 and 12 genes, 
respectively, were significant after multiple testing correction. Pathway 
analyses conducted on nominally significant targets showed that genes associated 
with BD and BMI were enriched for the Neuronal cell body Gene Ontology (GO) term 
(p = 1.0E-04; false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.025) and different pathways, 
including the Signaling by Hedgehog pathway (p = 4.8E-05, FDR = 0.02), while 
genes associated with BD and T2D showed no specific enrichment. The 
meta-analysis between BD and BMI identified 64 relevant single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs). While the majority of these were located in intergenic 
regions or in a locus on chromosome 16 near and in the NPIPL1 and SH2B1 genes 
(best SNP: rs4788101, p = 2.1E-24), five were located in the ETV5 gene (best 
SNP: rs1516725, p = 1E-24), which was previously associated with both BD and 
obesity, and one in the RPGRIP1L gene (rs1477199, p = 5.7E-09), which was also 
included in the Signaling by Hedgehog pathway. The meta-analysis between BD and 
T2D identified six significant SNPs, three of which were located in ALAS1 (best 
SNP: rs352165, p = 3.4E-08). Thirteen SNPs associated with BD and BMI, and one 
with BD and T2D, were located in genes which are part of the druggable genome. 
Our results support the hypothesis of shared genetic determinants between BD and 
BMI and point to genes involved in Hedgehog signaling as promising targets.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive lung cancer subtype with 
extremely poor prognosis. No targetable genetic driver events have been 
identified, and the treatment landscape for this disease has remained nearly 
unchanged for over 30 years. Here, we have taken a CRISPR-based screening 
approach to identify genetic vulnerabilities in SCLC that may serve as potential 
therapeutic targets. We used a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library targeting ~5000 
genes deemed to encode "druggable" proteins to perform loss-of-function genetic 
screens in a panel of cell lines derived from autochthonous genetically 
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Cross-cancer analyses allowed us to 
identify SCLC-selective vulnerabilities. In particular, we observed enhanced 
sensitivity of SCLC cells toward disruption of the pyrimidine biosynthesis 
pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a 
key enzyme in this pathway, reduced the viability of SCLC cells in vitro and 
strongly suppressed SCLC tumor growth in human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) 
models and in an autochthonous mouse model. These results indicate that DHODH 
inhibition may be an approach to treat SCLC.

Synthetic lethality exploits the phenomenon that a mutation in a cancer gene is 
often associated with new vulnerability which can be uniquely targeted 
therapeutically, leading to a significant increase in favorable outcome. DNA 
damage and survival pathways are among the most commonly mutated networks in 
human cancers. Recent data suggest that synthetic lethal interactions between a 
tumor defect and a DNA repair pathway can be used to preferentially kill tumor 
cells. We recently published a method, DiscoverSL, using multi-omic cancer data, 
that can predict synthetic lethal interactions of potential clinical relevance. 
Here, we apply the generality of our models in a comprehensive web tool called 
Synthetic Lethality Bio Discovery Portal (SL-BioDP) and extend the cancer types 
to 18 cancer genome atlas cohorts. SL-BioDP enables a data-driven computational 
approach to predict synthetic lethal interactions from hallmark cancer pathways 
by mining cancer's genomic and chemical interactions. Our tool provides queries 
and visualizations for exploring potentially targetable synthetic lethal 
interactions, shows Kaplan-Meier plots of clinical relevance, and provides in 
silico validation using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and drug efficacy data. Our 
method would thus shed light on mechanisms of synthetic lethal interactions and 
lead to the discovery of novel anticancer drugs.

BACKGROUND: The colorectum includes ascending colon, transverse colon, 
descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. Different sites of colorectal 
cancer (CRC) are different in many aspects, including clinical symptoms, 
biological behaviour, and prognosis.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyse prognosis, genes, bacteria, fungi, and 
microbial metabolome in different sites of CRC.
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and 
STAT were used to statistically describe and analyse the prognosis in different 
sites of CRC. RNA sequences of CRC from Broad Institute's GDAC Firehose were 
re-annotated and reanalysed based on different sites using weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to 
analyse the prognosis and Cytoscape was used to construct a drug-target network 
based on DGIdb databases. Bacterial 16S V3-V4 and fungal ITS V3-V4 ribosomal RNA 
genes of stool samples were sequenced. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry 
(GS/MS) was performed to detect the microbial metabolites in stool samples. 
Bioinformatics analysis was performed to compare distinct gut microorganisms and 
microbial metabolites between rectal and sigmoid cancers.
RESULTS: The prognosis in CRC with different sites is significantly different. 
The closer to the anus predicted longer survival time. The difference between 
genes and co-expression pairs in CRC with different sites were constructed. The 
relative abundance of 112 mRNAs and 26 lncRNAs correlated with the sites of CRC 
were listed. Nine differentially expressed genes at different sites of CRC were 
correlated with prognosis. A drug-gene interaction network contained 227 
drug-gene pairs were built. The relative abundance of gut bacteria and gut 
fungus, and the content of microbe-related metabolites were statistically 
different between rectal and sigmoid cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: There are many differences in prognosis, genome, drug targets, gut 
microbiome, and microbial metabolome in different colorectal cancer sites. These 
findings may improve our understanding of the role of the CRC sites in 
personalized and precision medicine.

Cells with higher levels of Myc proliferate more rapidly and supercompetitively 
eliminate neighboring cells. Nonetheless, tumor cells in aggressive breast 
cancers typically exhibit significant and stable heterogeneity in their Myc 
levels, which correlates with refractoriness to therapy and poor prognosis. This 
suggests that Myc heterogeneity confers some selective advantage on breast tumor 
growth and progression. To investigate this, we created a traceable 
MMTV-Wnt1-driven in vivo chimeric mammary tumor model comprising an admixture of 
low-Myc- and reversibly switchable high-Myc-expressing clones. We show that such 
tumors exhibit interclonal mutualism wherein cells with high-Myc expression 
facilitate tumor growth by promoting protumorigenic stroma yet concomitantly 
suppress Wnt expression, which renders them dependent for survival on paracrine 
Wnt provided by low-Myc-expressing clones. To identify any therapeutic 
vulnerabilities arising from such interdependency, we modeled Myc/Ras/p53/Wnt 
signaling cross talk as an executable network for low-Myc, for high-Myc clones, 
and for the 2 together. This executable mechanistic model replicated the 
observed interdependence of high-Myc and low-Myc clones and predicted a 
pharmacological vulnerability to coinhibition of COX2 and MEK. This was 
confirmed experimentally. Our study illustrates the power of executable models 
in elucidating mechanisms driving tumor heterogeneity and offers an innovative 
strategy for identifying combination therapies tailored to the oligoclonal 
landscape of heterogenous tumors.

Alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) is one of the several hallmarks of 
cancer. Genomic instability resulting from a disrupted DDR mechanism is known to 
contribute to cancer progression, and are subjected to radiation, cytotoxic, or 
more recently targeted therapies with limited success. Synthetic lethality (SL), 
which is a condition where simultaneous loss-of-function of the genes from 
complementary pathways result in loss of viability of cancer cells have been 
exploited to treat malignancies resulting from defects in certain DDR pathways. 
Albeit being a promising therapeutic strategy, number of SL based drugs 
currently in clinical trial is limited. In this work we performed a 
comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of alterations in 10 DDR pathways with 
different components of DNA repair. Using unsupervised clustering of single 
sample enrichment of these pathways in 7,272 tumor samples from 17 tumor types 
from TCGA, we identified three prominent clusters, each associated with specific 
DDR mechanisms. Somatic mutations in key DDR genes were found to be dominant in 
each of these three clusters with distinct DDR component. Using a 
machine-learning based algorithm we predicted SL partners specific to somatic 
mutations in key genes representing each of the three DDR clusters and 
identified potential druggable targets. We explored the potential FDA-approved 
drugs for targeting the predicted SL genes and tested the sensitivity using the 
drug screening data in cell lines with mutation in the primary DDR genes. We 
have shown clinical relevance, for selected targetable SL interactions using 
Kaplan-Meier analysis in terms of improved disease-free survival. Thus, our 
computational framework provides a basis for clinically relevant and actionable 
SL based drug targets specific to alterations in DDR pathways.

Viruses are one of the major causes of acute and chronic infectious diseases and 
thus a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Several studies have 
shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade 
innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signaling pathways. A 
collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of 
virus-host interactions and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the 
treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to 
elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics 
analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal 
effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a 
high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular 
process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with 
functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of 
the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an 
interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities 
for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human 
metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform 
for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of 
the viral evasion landscape.

IMPORTANCE: Pediatric cancers are epigenetic diseases; therefore, considering 
tumor gene expression information is necessary for a complete understanding of 
the tumorigenic processes.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and utility of incorporating comparative 
gene expression information into the precision medicine framework for 
difficult-to-treat pediatric and young adult patients with cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted as a 
consortium between the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Treehouse 
Childhood Cancer Initiative and clinical genomic trials. RNA sequencing 
(RNA-Seq) data were obtained from the following 4 clinical sites and analyzed at 
UCSC: British Columbia Children's Hospital (n = 31), Lucile Packard Children's 
Hospital at Stanford University (n = 80), CHOC Children's Hospital and Hyundai 
Cancer Institute (n = 46), and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium 
(n = 24). The study dates were January 1, 2016, to March 22, 2017.
EXPOSURES: Participants underwent tumor RNA-Seq profiling as part of 4 separate 
clinical trials at partner hospitals. The UCSC either downloaded RNA-Seq data 
from a partner institution for analysis in the cloud or provided a Docker 
pipeline that performed the same analysis at a partner institution. The UCSC 
then compared each participant's tumor RNA-Seq profile with more than 11 000 
uniformly analyzed tumor profiles from pediatric and young adult patients with 
cancer, downloaded from public data repositories. These comparisons were used to 
identify genes and pathways that are significantly overexpressed in each 
patient's tumor. Results of the UCSC analysis were presented to clinical 
partners.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Feasibility of a third-party institution (UCSC 
Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative) to obtain tumor RNA-Seq data from 
patients, conduct comparative analysis, and present analysis results to 
clinicians; and proportion of patients for whom comparative tumor gene 
expression analysis provided useful clinical and biological information.
RESULTS: Among 144 samples from children and young adults (median age at 
diagnosis, 9 years; range, 0-26 years; 72 of 118 [61.0%] male [26 patients sex 
unknown]) with a relapsed, refractory, or rare cancer treated on precision 
medicine protocols, RNA-Seq-derived gene expression was potentially useful for 
99 of 144 samples (68.8%) compared with DNA mutation information that was 
potentially useful for only 34 of 74 samples (45.9%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings suggest that tumor RNA-Seq 
comparisons may be feasible and highlight the potential clinical utility of 
incorporating such comparisons into the clinical genomic interpretation 
framework for difficult-to-treat pediatric and young adult patients with cancer. 
The study also highlights for the first time to date the potential clinical 
utility of harmonized publicly available genomic data sets.

We propose a computational workflow (I3) for intuitive integrative 
interpretation of complex genetic data mainly building on the self-organising 
principle. We illustrate the use in interpreting genetics of gene expression and 
understanding genetic regulators of protein phenotypes, particularly in 
conjunction with information from human population genetics and/or evolutionary 
history of human genes. We reveal that loss-of-function intolerant genes tend to 
be depleted of tissue-sharing genetics of gene expression in brains, and if 
highly expressed, have broad effects on the protein phenotypes studied. We 
suggest that this workflow presents a general solution to the challenge of 
complex genetic data interpretation. I3 is available at

BACKGROUND: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is generally associated 
with a very dismal prognosis. Nevertheless, patients with similar 
clinicopathological characteristics can have markedly different clinical 
outcomes. Our aim was the identification of novel molecular determinants 
influencing survival.
METHODS: Gene expression profiles of extreme HGSOC survivors (training set) were 
obtained by microarray. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched 
signalling pathways were determined. A prognostic signature was generated and 
validated on curatedOvarianData database through a meta-analysis approach. The 
best prognostic biomarker from the signature was confirmed by RT-qPCR and by 
immunohistochemistry on an independent validation set. Cox regression model was 
chosen for survival analysis.
RESULTS: Eighty DEGs and the extracellular matrix-receptor (ECM-receptor) 
interaction pathway were associated to extreme survival. A 10-gene prognostic 
signature able to correctly classify patients with 98% of accuracy was 
identified. By an 'in-silico' meta-analysis, overexpression of FXYD 
domain-containing ion transport regulator 5 (FXYD5), also known as dysadherin, 
was confirmed in HGSOC short-term survivors compared to long-term ones. Its 
prognostic and predictive power was then successfully validated, both at mRNA 
and protein level, first on training than on validation sample set.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the possible involvement of FXYD5 and ECM-receptor 
interaction signal pathway in HCSOC survival and prognosis.

The combined loss of CHD1 and MAP3K7 promotes aggressive prostate cancer by 
unknown mechanisms. Because both of these genes are lost genetically in prostate 
cancer, they cannot be directly targeted. We applied an established 
computational systems pharmacology approach (TRAP) to identify altered signaling 
pathways and associated druggable targets. We compared gene expression profiles 
of prostate cancer with coloss of CHD1 and MAP3K7 with prostate cancer diploid 
for these genes using The Cancer Genome Atlas patient samples. This analysis 
prioritized druggable target genes that included CDK1 and CDK2. We validated 
that inhibitors of these druggable target genes, including the CDK1/CDK2 
inhibitor dinaciclib, had antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects selectively on 
mouse prostate cells with knockdown of Chd1 and Map3k7. Dinaciclib had stronger 
effects on prostate cells with suppression of Map3k7 independent of Chd1 and 
also compared with cells without loss of Map3k7. Dinaciclib treatment reduced 
expression of homologous recombination (HR) repair genes such as ATM, ATR, 
BRCA2, and RAD51, blocked BRCA1 phosphorylation, reduced RAD51 foci formation, 
and increased γH2AX foci selectively in prostate cells with suppression of 
Map3k7, thus inhibiting HR repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks. 
Dinaciclib-induced HR disruption was also observed in human prostate cells with 
knockdown of MAP3K7. Cotreatment of dinaciclib with DNA-damaging agents or PARP 
inhibitor resulted in a stronger cytotoxic effect on prostate cells with 
suppression of MAP3K7 compared with those without loss of MAP3K7, or to each 
single agent. IMPLICATIONS: These findings demonstrate that loss of MAP3K7 is a

The Sonic hedgehog signalling is known to play a crucial role in regulating 
embryonic development, cancer stem cell maintenance and tissue patterning. 
Dysregulated hedgehog signalling has been reported to affect tumorigenesis and 
drug response in various human malignancies. Epigenetic therapy relying on DNA 
methyltransferase and Histone deacetylase inhibitors are being proposed as 
potential drug candidates considering their efficiency in preventing development 
of cancer progenitor cells, killing drug resistant cells and also dictating 
"on/off" switch of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. In this docking 
approach, epigenetic modulators were virtually screened for their efficiency in 
inhibiting key regulators of SHH pathway viz., sonic hedgehog, Smoothened and 
Gli using polypharmacological approach. The control drugs and epigenetic 
modulators were docked with PDB protein structures using AutoDock vina and 
further checked for their drug-likeness properties. Further molecular dynamics 
simulation using VMD and NAMD, and MMP/GBSA energy calculation were employed for 
verifying the stability and entropy of the ligand-receptor complex. EPZ-6438 and 
GSK 343 (EZH2 inhibitors), CHR 3996 and Mocetinostat (HDAC inhibitors), GSK 126 
(HKMT inhibitor) and UNC 1215 (L3MBTL3 antagonist) exhibited multiple-targeted 
approach in modulating HH signalling. This is the first study to report these 
epigenetic drugs as potential multi-targeted hedgehog pathway inhibitors. Thus, 
epigenetic polypharmacology approach can be explored as a better alternative to 
challenges of acute long term toxicity and drug resistance occurring due to 
traditional single targeted chemotherapy in the future.

Recent years have seen an increase in the availability of pharmacogenomic 
databases such as Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell 
Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) that provide genomic and functional characterization 
information for multiple cell lines. Studies have alluded to the fact that 
specific characterizations may be inconsistent between different databases. 
Analysis of the potential discrepancies in the different databases is highly 
significant, as these sources are frequently used to analyze and validate 
methodologies for personalized cancer therapies. In this article, we review the 
recent developments in investigating the correspondence between different 
pharmacogenomics databases and discuss the potential factors that require 
attention when incorporating these sources in any modeling analysis. 
Furthermore, we explored the consistency among these databases using copulas 
that can capture nonlinear dependencies between two sets of data.

The aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes in tumor 
microenvironment (TME) has been associated with the pathogenesis of colon 
cancer. An integrative exploration of transcriptional markers (gene signatures) 
and miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks in colon tumor stroma (CTS) remains lacking. 
Using two datasets of mRNA and miRNA expression profiling in CTS, we identified 
differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) and differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) between CTS and normal stroma. Furthermore, we identified the 
transcriptional markers which were both gene targets of DEmiRs and hub genes in 
the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs. Moreover, we investigated 
the associations between the transcriptional markers and tumor immunity in colon 
cancer. We identified 17 upregulated and seven downregulated DEmiRs in CTS 
relative to normal stroma based on a miRNA expression profiling dataset. Pathway 
analysis revealed that the downregulated DEmiRs were significantly involved in 
25 KEGG pathways (such as TGF-β, Wnt, cell adhesion molecules, and 
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction), and the upregulated DEmiRs were 
involved in 10 pathways (such as extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction 
and proteoglycans in cancer). Moreover, we identified 460 DEGs in CTS versus 
normal stroma by a meta-analysis of two gene expression profiling datasets. 
Among them, eight upregulated DEGs were both hub genes in the PPI network of 
DEGs and target genes of the downregulated DEmiRs. We found that three of the 
eight DEGs were negative prognostic factors consistently in two colon cancer 
cohorts, including COL5A2, EDNRA, and OLR1. The identification of 
transcriptional markers and miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks in CTS may provide 
insights into the mechanism of tumor immune microenvironment regulation in colon 
cancer.

Depression is a severe and debilitating mental disorder diagnosed by evaluation 
of affective, cognitive and physical depression symptoms. Severity of these 
symptoms strongly impacts individual's quality of life and is influenced by a 
combination of genetic and environmental factors. One of the molecular 
mechanisms allowing for an interplay between these factors is DNA methylation, 
an epigenetic modification playing a pivotal role in regulation of brain 
functioning across lifespan. The aim of this study was to investigate if there 
are DNA methylation signatures associated with depression symptomatology in 
order to identify molecular mechanisms contributing to pathophysiology of 
depression. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 
continuous depression symptomatology score measured in a cohort of 724 
monozygotic Danish twins (346 males, 378 females). Through EWAS analyses 
adjusted for sex, age, flow-cytometry based blood cell composition, and twin 
relatedness structure in the data we identified depression symptomatology score 
to be associated with blood DNA methylation levels in promoter regions of 
neuropsin (KLK8, p-value = 4.7 × 10-7) and DAZ associated protein 2 (DAZAP2, 
p-value = 3.13 × 10-8) genes. Other top associated probes were located in gene 
bodies of MAD1L1 (p-value = 5.16 × 10-6), SLC29A2 (p-value = 6.15 × 10-6) and 
AKT1 (p-value = 4.47 × 10-6), all genes associated before with development of 
depression. Additionally, the following three measures (a) DNAmAge (calculated 
with Horvath and Hannum epigenetic clock estimators) adjusted for chronological 
age, (b) difference between DNAmAge and chronological age, and (c) DNAmAge 
acceleration were not associated with depression symptomatology score in our 
cohort. In conclusion, our data suggests that depression symptomatology score is 
associated with DNA methylation levels of genes implicated in response to 
stress, depressive-like behaviors, and recurrent depression in patients, but not 
with global DNA methylation changes across the genome.

BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an uncommon but highly fatal malignancy, 
with limited adjuvant therapy. The present study aims to explore the actionable 
alterations and precision oncology for GBC patients.
METHODS: Patients with pathologically confirmed GBC who progressed after 
first-line systemic treatment were enrolled. Genomic alterations were captured 
by ultra-deep targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS). The actionabilities of 
alterations and the therapeutic regimens were evaluated by a multidisciplinary 
tumor board (MDTB).
RESULTS: Sixty patients with GBC were enrolled and analyzed. tNGS was 
successfully achieved in all patients. The median tumor mutation burden for GBC 
patients was 5.4 (range: 0.8-36.74) mutations/Mb, and the most common mutations 
were in TP53 (73%), CDKN2A (25%) and PIK3CA (20%). The most frequently 
copy-number altered genes were CDKN2A deletion (11.7%) and ERBB2 amplification 
(13.3%). 23% of the patients displayed gene fusion; 17 fusion events were 
identified, and 14 of the 17 fusion events co-occurred with mutations in driver 
genes. In total, 46 of the 60 (76%) patients were identified as possessing at 
least one actionable target to proceed precision oncology.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed the mutational profile for the clinical 
practice of precision oncology in GBC patients.

More than a quarter of lung, uterine, and ovarian adenocarcinoma (LUAD, USEC, 
and OV) tumors are resistant to platinum drugs. Only recently and only in OV, 
patterns of copy-number alterations that predict survival in response to 
platinum were discovered, and only by using the tensor GSVD to compare Agilent 
microarray platform-matched profiles of patient-matched normal and primary tumor 
DNA. Here, we use the GSVD to compare whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and 
Affymetrix microarray profiles of patient-matched normal and primary LUAD, USEC, 
and OV tumor DNA. First, the GSVD uncovers patterns similar to one Agilent OV 
pattern, where a loss of most of the chromosome arm 6p combined with a gain of 
12p encode for transformation. Like the Agilent OV pattern, the WGS LUAD and 
Affymetrix LUAD, USEC, and OV patterns are correlated with shorter survival, in 
general and in response to platinum. Like the tensor GSVD, the GSVD separates 
these tumor-exclusive genotypes from experimental inconsistencies. Second, by 
identifying the shorter survival phenotypes among the WGS- and 
Affymetrix-profiled tumors, the Agilent pattern proves to be a 
technology-independent predictor of survival, independent also of the best other 
indicator at diagnosis, i.e., stage. Third, like no other indicator, the pattern 
predicts the overall survival of OV patients experiencing progression-free 
survival, in general and in response to platinum. We conclude that comparative 
spectral decompositions, such as the GSVD and tensor GSVD, underlie a 
mathematically universal description of the relationships between a primary 
tumor's genotype and a patient's overall survival phenotype, which other methods 
miss.

Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) 
gene rearrangement (MLL-R) is considered a distinct leukemia from childhood or 
non-MLL-R infant ALL. To detect key genes and elucidate the molecular mechanisms 
of MLL-R infant ALL, microarray expression data were downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
between MLL-R and non-MLL-R infant ALL were identified. Gene ontology (GO) and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were 
carried out. Then, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
and identified the hub genes. Finally, drug-gene interactions were mined. A 
total of 139 cases of MLL-R infant ALL including 77 (55.4%) fusions with AF4, 38 
(27.3%) with ENL, 14 (10.1%) with AF9, and 10 (7.2%) other gene fusions were 
characterized. A total of 236 up-regulated and 84 down-regulated DEGs were 
identified. The up-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in homophilic cell 
adhesion, negative regulation of apoptotic process and cellular response to drug 
GO terms, while down-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix 
organization, protein kinase C signaling and neuron projection extension GO 
terms. The up-regulated DEGs were enriched in seven KEGG pathways, mainly 
involving transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways, and down-regulated 
DEGs were involved in three main KEGG pathways including Alzheimer's disease, 
TGF-beta signaling pathway, and hematopoietic cell lineage. The PPI network 
included 297 nodes and 410 edges, with MYC, ALB, CD44, PTPRC and TNF identified 
as hub genes. Twenty-three drug-gene interactions including four up-regulated 
hub genes and 24 drugs were constructed by Drug Gene Interaction database 
(DGIdb). In conclusion, MYC, ALB, CD44, PTPRC and TNF may be potential 
bio-markers for the diagnosis and therapy of MLL-R infant ALL.

With the emergence of genome editing technologies and synthetic biology, it is 
now possible to engineer genetic circuits driving a cell's phenotypic response 
to a stressor. However, capturing a continuous response, rather than simply a 
binary 'on' or 'off' response, remains a bioengineering challenge. No tools 
currently exist to identify gene candidates responsible for predetermining and 
fine-tuning cell response phenotypes. To address this gap, we devised a novel 
Regulostat Inferelator (RSI) algorithm to decipher intrinsic molecular devices 
or networks that predetermine cellular phenotypic responses. The RSI algorithm 
is designed to extract gene expression patterns from basal transcriptomic data 
in order to identify 'regulostat' constituent gene pairs, which exhibit 
rheostat-like mode-of-cooperation capable of fine-tuning cellular response. Our 
proof-of-concept study provides computational evidence for the existence of 
regulostats and that these networks predetermine cellular response prior to 
exposure to a stressor or drug. In addition, our work, for the first time, 
provides evidence of context-specific, drug-regulostat interactions in 
predetermining drug response phenotypes in cancer cells. Given RSI-inferred 
regulostat networks offer insights for prioritizing gene candidates capable of 
rendering a resistant phenotype sensitive to a given drug, we envision that this 
tool will be of great value in bioengineering and medicine.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis and treatment decisions in cancer increasingly depend on a 
detailed analysis of the mutational status of a patient's genome. This analysis 
relies on previously published information regarding the association of 
variations to disease progression and possible interventions. Clinicians to a 
large degree use biomedical search engines to obtain such information; however, 
the vast majority of scientific publications focus on basic science and have no 
direct clinical impact. We develop the Variant-Information Search Tool (VIST), a 
search engine designed for the targeted search of clinically relevant 
publications given an oncological mutation profile.
RESULTS: VIST indexes all PubMed abstracts and content from ClinicalTrials.gov. 
It applies advanced text mining to identify mentions of genes, variants and 
drugs and uses machine learning based scoring to judge the clinical relevance of 
indexed abstracts. Its functionality is available through a fast and intuitive 
web interface. We perform several evaluations, showing that VIST's ranking is 
superior to that of PubMed or a pure vector space model with regard to the 
clinical relevance of a document's content.
CONCLUSION: Different user groups search repositories of scientific publications 
with different intentions. This diversity is not adequately reflected in the 
standard search engines, often leading to poor performance in specialized 
settings. We develop a search engine for the specific case of finding documents 
that are clinically relevant in the course of cancer treatment. We believe that 
the architecture of our engine, heavily relying on machine learning algorithms, 
can also act as a blueprint for search engines in other, equally specific 
domains. VIST is freely available at https://vist.informatik.hu-berlin.de/.

In this work, we propose iProFun, an integrative analysis tool to screen for 
proteogenomic functional traits perturbed by DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) 
and DNA methylations. The goal is to characterize functional consequences of DNA 
copy number and methylation alterations in tumors and to facilitate screening 
for cancer drivers contributing to tumor initiation and progression. 
Specifically, we consider three functional molecular quantitative traits: mRNA 
expression levels, global protein abundances, and phosphoprotein abundances. We 
aim to identify those genes whose CNAs and/or DNA methylations have 
cis-associations with either some or all three types of molecular traits. 
Compared with analyzing each molecular trait separately, the joint modeling of 
multi-omics data enjoys several benefits: iProFun experienced enhanced power for 
detecting significant cis-associations shared across different omics data types, 
and it also achieved better accuracy in inferring cis-associations unique to 
certain type(s) of molecular trait(s). For example, unique associations of 
CNAs/methylations to global/phospho protein abundances may imply 
posttranslational regulations.We applied iProFun to ovarian high-grade serous 
carcinoma tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Clinical Proteomic Tumor 
Analysis Consortium and identified CNAs and methylations of 500 and 121 genes, 
respectively, affecting the cis-functional molecular quantitative traits of the 
corresponding genes. We observed substantial power gain via the joint analysis 
of iProFun. For example, iProFun identified 117 genes whose CNAs were associated 
with phosphoprotein abundances by leveraging mRNA expression levels and global 
protein abundances. By comparison, analyses based on phosphoprotein data alone 
identified none. A network analysis of these 117 genes revealed the known 
oncogene AKT1 as a key hub node interacting with many of the rest. In addition, 
iProFun identified one gene, BIN2, whose DNA methylation has cis-associations 
with its mRNA expression, global protein, and phosphoprotein abundances. These 
and other genes identified by iProFun could serve as potential drug targets for 
ovarian cancer.

Effective management of brain and spine tumors relies on a multidisciplinary 
approach encompassing surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy. In the era of 
personalized oncology, the latter is complemented by various molecularly 
targeting agents. Precise identification of cellular targets for these drugs 
requires comprehensive profiling of the cancer genome coupled with an efficient 
analytic pipeline, leading to an informed decision on drug selection, prognosis, 
and confirmation of the original pathological diagnosis. Acquisition of optimal 
tumor tissue for such analysis is paramount and often presents logistical 
challenges in neurosurgery. Here, we describe the experience and results of the 
Personalized OncoGenomics (POG) program with a focus on tumors of the central 
nervous system (CNS). Patients with recurrent CNS tumors were consented and 
enrolled into the POG program prior to accrual of tumor and matched blood 
followed by whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing and processing through the 
POG bioinformatic pipeline. Sixteen patients were enrolled into POG. In each 
case, POG analyses identified genomic drivers including novel oncogenic fusions, 
aberrant pathways, and putative therapeutic targets. POG has highlighted that 
personalized oncology is truly a multidisciplinary field, one in which 
neurosurgeons must play a vital role if these programs are to succeed and 
benefit our patients.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive fatal 
neurodegenerative disease affecting one in 350 people. The aim of Project MinE 
is to elucidate the pathophysiology of ALS through whole-genome sequencing at 
least 15,000 ALS patients and 7500 controls at 30× coverage. Here, we present 
the Project MinE data browser ( databrowser.projectmine.com ), a unique and 
intuitive one-stop, open-access server that provides detailed information on 
genetic variation analyzed in a new and still growing set of 4366 ALS cases and 
1832 matched controls. Through its visual components and interactive design, the 
browser specifically aims to be a resource to those without a biostatistics 
background and allow clinicians and preclinical researchers to integrate Project 
MinE data into their own research. The browser allows users to query a 
transcript and immediately access a unique combination of detailed (meta)data, 
annotations and association statistics that would otherwise require analytic 
expertise and visits to scattered resources.

Novel therapeutic regulators of uterine contractility are needed to manage 
preterm labor, induce labor and control postpartum hemorrhage. Therefore, we 
previously developed a high-throughput assay for large-scale screening of small 
molecular compounds to regulate calcium-mobilization in primary mouse uterine 
myometrial cells. The goal of this study was to select the optimal myometrial 
cells for our high-throughput drug discovery assay, as well as determine the 
similarity or differences of myometrial cells to vascular smooth muscle cells 
(VSMCs)-the most common off-target of current myometrial therapeutics. Molecular 
and pharmacological assays were used to compare myometrial cells from four 
sources: primary cells isolated from term pregnant human and murine myometrium, 
immortalized pregnant human myometrial (PHM-1) cells and immortalized 
non-pregnant human myometrial (hTERT-HM) cells. In addition, myometrial cells 
were compared to vascular SMCs. We found that the transcriptome profiles of 
hTERT-HM and PHM1 cells were most similar (r = 0.93 and 0.90, respectively) to 
human primary myometrial cells. Comparative transcriptome profiling of primary 
human myometrial transcriptome and VSMCs revealed 498 upregulated (p ≤ 0.01, 
log2FC≥1) genes, of which 142 can serve as uterine-selective druggable targets. 
In the high-throughput Ca2+-assay, PHM1 cells had the most similar response to 
primary human myometrial cells in OT-induced Ca2+-release (Emax = 195% and 143%, 
EC50 = 30 nM and 120 nM, respectively), while all sources of myometrial cells 
showed excellent and similar robustness and reproducibility (Z' = 0.52 to 0.77). 
After testing a panel of 61 compounds, we found that the stimulatory and 
inhibitory responses of hTERT-HM cells were highly-correlated (r = 0.94 and 
0.95, respectively) to human primary cells. Moreover, ten compounds were 
identified that displayed uterine-selectivity (≥5-fold Emax or EC50 compared to 
VSMCs). Collectively, this study found that hTERT-HM cells exhibited the most 
similarity to primary human myometrial cells and, therefore, is an optimal 
substitute for large-scale screening to identify novel therapeutic regulators of 
myometrial contractility. Moreover, VSMCs can serve as an important 
counter-screening tool to assess uterine-selectivity of targets and drugs given 
the similarity observed in the transcriptome and response to compounds.

BACKGROUND: CDK4/6 inhibitors are a promising treatment strategy in tumor 
therapy but are hampered by resistance mechanisms. This study was performed to 
reveal predictive markers, mechanisms of resistance and to develop rational 
combination therapies for a personalized therapy approach in bladder cancer.
METHODS: A genome-scale CRISPR-dCas9 activation screen for resistance to the 
CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib was performed in the bladder cancer derived cell 
line T24. sgRNA counts were analyzed using next generation sequencing and 
MAGeCK-VISPR. Significantly enriched sgRNAs were cloned and validated on a 
molecular and functional level for mediating resistance to Palbociclib 
treatment. Analysis was done in vitro and in vivo in the chorioallantois 
membrane model of the chicken embryo. Comparison of screen hits to signaling 
pathways and clinically relevant molecular alterations was performed using 
DAVID, Reactome, DGIdb and cBioPortal.
RESULTS: In the screen, 1024 sgRNAs encoding for 995 genes were significantly 
enriched indicative of mediators of resistance. 8 random sgRNAs were validated, 
revealing partial rescue to Palbociclib treatment. Within this gene panel, 
members of Receptor-Tyrosine Kinases, PI3K-Akt, Ras/MAPK, JAK/STAT or Wnt 
signaling pathways were identified. Combination of Palbociclib with inhibitors 
against these signaling pathways revealed beneficial effects in vitro and in in 
vivo xenografts.
CONCLUSIONS: Identification of potential predictive markers, resistance 
mechanisms and rational combination therapies could be achieved by applying a 
CRISPR-dCas9 screening approach in bladder cancer.

BACKGROUND: Numerous driver mutations have been identified in colorectal cancer 
(CRC), but their relevance to the development of targeted therapies remains 
elusive. The secondary effects of pathogenic driver mutations on downstream 
signaling pathways offer a potential approach for the identification of 
therapeutic targets. We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes as 
potential drug targets linked to driver mutations.
METHODS: Somatic mutations and the gene expression data of 582 CRC patients were 
utilized, incorporating the mutational status of 39,916 and the expression 
levels of 20,500 genes. To uncover candidate targets, the expression levels of 
various genes in wild-type and mutant cases for the most frequent disruptive 
mutations were compared with a Mann-Whitney test. A survival analysis was 
performed in 2100 patients with transcriptomic gene expression data. 
Up-regulated genes associated with worse survival were filtered for potentially 
actionable targets. The most significant hits were validated in an independent 
set of 171 CRC patients.
RESULTS: Altogether, 426 disruptive mutation-associated upregulated genes were 
identified. Among these, 95 were linked to worse recurrence-free survival (RFS). 
Based on the druggability filter, 37 potentially actionable targets were 
revealed. We selected seven genes and validated their expression in 171 patient 
specimens. The best independently validated combinations were DUSP4 (p = 2.6 × 
10-12) in ACVR2A mutated (7.7%) patients; BMP4 (p = 1.6 × 10-04) in SOX9 mutated 
(8.1%) patients; TRIB2 (p = 1.35 × 10-14) in ACVR2A mutated patients; VSIG4 (p = 
2.6 × 10-05) in ANK3 mutated (7.6%) patients, and DUSP4 (p = 7.1 × 10-04) in 
AMER1 mutated (8.2%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The results uncovered potentially druggable genes in colorectal 
cancer. The identified mutations could enable future patient stratification for 
targeted therapy.

Combinatorial drug therapy can improve the therapeutic effect and reduce the 
corresponding adverse events. In silico strategies to classify synergistic vs. 
antagonistic drug pairs is more efficient than experimental strategies. However, 
most of the developed methods have been applied only to cancer therapies. In 
this study, we introduce a novel method, XGBoost, based on five features of 
drugs and biomolecular networks of their targets, to classify synergistic vs. 
antagonistic drug combinations from different drug categories. We found that 
XGBoost outperformed other classifiers in both stratified fivefold 
cross-validation (CV) and independent validation. For example, XGBoost achieved 
higher predictive accuracy than other models (0.86, 0.78, 0.78, and 0.83 for 
XGBoost, logistic regression, naïve Bayesian, and random forest, respectively) 
for an independent validation set. We also found that the five-feature XGBoost 
model is much more effective at predicting combinatorial therapies that have 
synergistic effects than those with antagonistic effects. The five-feature 
XGBoost model was also validated on TCGA data with accuracy of 0.79 among the 61 
tested drug pairs, which is comparable to that of DeepSynergy. Among the 14 main 
anatomical/pharmacological groups classified according to WHO Anatomic 
Therapeutic Class, for drugs belonging to five groups, their prediction accuracy 
was significantly increased (odds ratio < 1) or reduced (odds ratio > 1) 
(Fisher's exact test, p < 0.05). This study concludes that our five-feature 
XGBoost model has significant benefits for classifying synergistic vs. 
antagonistic drug combinations.

G-quadruplexes (G4) are alternative nucleic acid structures involved in 
transcription, translation and replication. Aberrant G4 formation and 
stabilisation is linked to genome instability and cancer. G4 ligand treatment 
disrupts key biological processes leading to cell death. To discover genes and 
pathways involved with G4s and gain mechanistic insights into G4 biology, we 
present the first unbiased genome-wide study to systematically identify human 
genes that promote cell death when silenced by shRNA in the presence of 
G4-stabilising small molecules. Many novel genetic vulnerabilities were revealed 
opening up new therapeutic possibilities in cancer, which we exemplified by an 
orthogonal pharmacological inhibition approach that phenocopies gene silencing. 
We find that targeting the WEE1 cell cycle kinase or USP1 deubiquitinase in 
combination with G4 ligand treatment enhances cell killing. We also identify new 
genes and pathways regulating or interacting with G4s and demonstrate that the 
DDX42 DEAD-box helicase is a newly discovered G4-binding protein.

PURPOSE: Many targeted therapies are currently available only via clinical 
trials. Therefore, routine precision oncology using biomarker-based assignment 
to drug depends on matching patients to clinical trials. A comprehensive and 
up-to-date trial database is necessary for optimal patient-trial matching.
METHODS: We describe processes for establishing and maintaining a clinical trial 
database, focusing on genomically informed trials. Furthermore, we present 
OCTANE (Oncology Clinical Trial Annotation Engine), an informatics framework 
supporting these processes in a scalable fashion. To illustrate how the 
framework can be applied at an institution, we describe how we implemented an 
instance of OCTANE at a large cancer center. OCTANE consists of three modules. 
The data aggregation module automates retrieval, aggregation, and update of 
trial information. The annotation module establishes the database schema, 
implements data integration necessary for automation, and provides an annotation 
interface. The update module monitors trial change logs, identifies critical 
change events, and alerts the annotators when manual intervention may be needed.
RESULTS: Using OCTANE, we annotated 5,439 oncology clinical trials (4,438 
genomically informed trials) that collectively were associated with 1,453 drugs, 
779 genes, and 252 cancer types. To date, we have used the database to screen 
4,220 patients for trial eligibility. We compared the update module with expert 
review, and the module achieved 98.5% accuracy, 0% false-negative rate, and 2.3% 
false-positive rate.
CONCLUSION: OCTANE is a general informatics framework that can be helpful for 
establishing and maintaining a comprehensive database necessary for automating 
patient-trial matching, which facilitates the successful delivery of 
personalized cancer care on a routine basis. Several OCTANE components are 
publically available and may be useful to other precision oncology programs.

Drug repurposing techniques allow existing drugs to be tested against diseases 
outside their initial spectrum, resulting in reduced cost and eliminating the 
long time-frames of new drug development. In silico drug repurposing further 
speeds up the process either by proposing drugs suitable to invert the 
transcriptomic profile of a disease or by indicating drugs based on their common 
targets or structural similarity with other drugs with similar mode of action. 
Such methods usually return a number of potential repurposed drugs that need to 
be tested against the disease in in vitro, pre-clinical and clinical studies. 
Thus, it is crucial to have a more sophisticated candidate drug ranking in order 
to start testing from the most promising chemical substances. As a means to 
enhance the above decision process, we present CoDReS (Composite Drug Reranking 
Scoring), a drug (re-)ranking web-based tool, which combines an initial drug 
ranking (i.e. repurposing score or hypothesis/potentiality score) with a 
functional score of each drug considered in conjunction with the disease under 
study as well as with a structural score derived from potential drugability 
violations. Furthermore, a structural similarity clustering is applied on the 
considered drugs and a handful of structural exemplars are suggested for further 
in vitro and in vivo validation. The user is able to filter the results further,

A plethora of databases exist online that can assist in in silico chemical or 
drug safety assessment. However, a systematic review and grouping of databases, 
based on purpose and information content, consolidated in a single source, has 
been lacking. To resolve this issue, this review provides a comprehensive 
listing of the key in silico data resources relevant to: chemical identity and 
properties, drug action, toxicology (including nano-material toxicity), 
exposure, omics, pathways, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Elimination 
(ADME) properties, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, patents-related 
databases, biological (genes, enzymes, proteins, other macromolecules etc.) 
databases, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), environmental exposure related, 
and finally databases relating to animal alternatives in support of 3Rs 
policies. More than nine hundred databases were identified and reviewed against 
criteria relating to accessibility, data coverage, interoperability or 
application programming interface (API), appropriate identifiers, types of in 
vitro, in vivo,-clinical or other data recorded and suitability for modelling, 
read-across, or similarity searching. This review also specifically addresses 
the need for solutions for mapping and integration of databases into a common 
platform for better translatability of preclinical data to clinical data.

Aim: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) carries a dismal prognosis. Integrated 
proteogenomic analysis was performed to understand GBM pathophysiology. 
Patients & methods: 17 patient samples were analyzed for driver mutations, 
oncogenes, major pathway alterations and molecular changes at gene and protein 
level. Clinical, treatment and survival data were collected. Results: 
Significantly mutated genes included TP53, EGFR, PIK3R1, PTEN, NF1, RET and 
STAG2. EGFR mutations noted included EGFRvIII-expression, EGFR-L816Q missense 
mutation-exon 21 and EGFR fusion (FGFR3-TACC3). TP53 mutations were noticed in 
COSMIC hot-spot driver gene and accompany IDH1 and ATRX mutations suggesting 
low- to high-grade glioma transformation. Proteomics showed higher (53%) EGFR 
expression than genomic expression (23%). MGMT methylation was present in 
two-thirds of cases. Conclusion: This study identifies a distinct biological 
process that may characterize each GBM differently. Proteogenomic data identify 
potential therapeutic targets of GBM.

INTRODUCTION: Polypharmacy is a growing problem in the United States. The use of 
multiple medications increases the likelihood that a patient will experience 
potential drug interactions and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Those individuals 
with dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD) are at greater risk, due to age, 
comorbidities, and an increased likelihood of being on a greater number of 
neuroactive medications.
METHODS: uMETHOD Health (uMH) has developed a precision medicine platform to 
address dementia and mild AD through the creation of personalized, multidomain 
treatment plans. Many interactions and ADRs may be observed, such as drug-drug 
interactions (DDIs), drug-gene interactions (DGIs), anticholinergic cognitive 
burden (ACB), and depression-inducing drugs (DIDs). uMH's algorithms can parse 
these interactions, rate them based on input from open-source databases, and 
then record all these interactions in a generated treatment plan. A total of 295 
individuals aged 65 and older were included in this analysis.
RESULTS: Of 295 individuals, 97.59% were on at least one medication, with an 
overall mean of 11.5 medications per person; 83.66% were on five or more 
medications. A total of 102 DGIs, 3642 DDIs, and one high-priority DDI were 
found in this population. There was a significant increase in the number of DDIs 
as medications per person increased (P value < 0.0001). Of the population, 
65.86% were on one or more anticholinergic drugs. There was a significant 
difference in the ACB score between individuals with cognitive decline and those 
without. In total, 60.98% of the overall population were on DIDs, with a mean of 
1.19 medications per person.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this work show that older populations have a high 
medication burden. With the growing elderly and AD populations, medication 
management for polypharmacy is a need that grows direr every year. uMH's 
platform was able to identify a multitude of polypharmacy problems that 
individuals are currently facing.

MOTIVATION: The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) nuclease system has allowed for 
high-throughput, large scale pooled screens for functional genomic studies. To 
aid in the translation of functional genomics to therapeutics, we developed 
DrugThatGene (DTG) as a web-based application that streamlines analysis of 
potential therapeutic targets identified from functional genetic screens.
RESULTS: Starting from a gene list as input, DTG offers automated identification 
of small molecules along with supporting information from human genetic and 
other relevant databases. Furthermore, DTG aids in the identification of common 
biological pathways and protein complexes in conjunction with associated small 
molecule inhibitors. Taken together, DTG aims to expedite the identification of 
small molecules from the abundance of functional genetic data generated from 
CRISPR screens.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DTG is an open-source and free software 
available as a website at http://drugthatgene.pinellolab.org. Source code is 
available at: https://github.com/pinellolab/DrugThatGene, which can be 
downloaded in order to run DTG locally.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the genomic differences between metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma (LTUC) and upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). We 
compare genomic features of primary and metastatic UTUC and LTUC tumors in a 
cohort of patients with end stage disease.
METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing on matched primary and metastatic 
tumor samples (N=37) from 7 patients with metastatic UC collected via rapid 
autopsy. Inter- and intra-patient mutational burden, mutational signatures, 
predicted deleterious mutations, and somatic copy alterations (sCNV) were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: We investigated 3 patients with UTUC (3 primary samples, 13 metastases) 
and 4 patients with LTUC (4 primary samples, 17 metastases). We found that sSNV 
burden was higher in metastatic LTUC compared to UTUC. Moreover, the APOBEC 
mutational signature was pervasive in metastatic LTUC and less so in UTUC. 
Despite a lower overall sSNV burden, UTUC displayed greater inter- and 
intra-individual genomic distances at the copy number level between primary and 
metastatic tumors than LTUC. Our data also indicate that metastatic UTUC lesions 
can arise from small clonal populations present in the primary cancer. 
Importantly, putative druggable mutations were found across patients with the 
majority shared across all metastases within a patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic UTUC demonstrated a lower overall mutational burden but 
greater structural variability compared to LTUC. Our findings suggest that 
metastatic UTUC displays a greater spectrum of copy number divergence from LTUC. 
Importantly, we identified druggable lesions shared across metastatic samples, 
which demonstrate a level of targetable homogeneity within individual patients.

Genetic disease genes are considered a promising source of drug targets. Most 
diseases are caused by more than one pathogenic factor; thus, it is reasonable 
to consider that chemical agents targeting multiple disease genes are more 
likely to have desired activities. This is supported by a comprehensive analysis 
on the relationships between agent activity/druggability and target genetic 
characteristics. The therapeutic potential of agents increases steadily with 
increasing number of targeted disease genes, and can be further enhanced by 
strengthened genetic links between targets and diseases. By using the 
multi-label classification models for genetics-based drug activity prediction, 
we provide universal tools for prioritizing drug candidates. All of the 
documented data and the machine-learning prediction service are available at 
SCG-Drug (http://zhanglab.hzau.edu.cn/scgdrug).

BACKGROUND: Drug repositioning, also known as drug repurposing, defines new 
indications for existing drugs and can be used as an alternative to drug 
development. In recent years, the accumulation of large volumes of information 
related to drugs and diseases has led to the development of various 
computational approaches for drug repositioning. Although herbal medicines have 
had a great impact on current drug discovery, there are still a large number of 
herbal compounds that have no definite indications.
RESULTS: In the present study, we constructed a computational model to predict 
the unknown pharmacological effects of herbal compounds using machine learning 
techniques. Based on the assumption that similar diseases can be treated with 
similar drugs, we used four categories of drug-drug similarity (e.g., chemical 
structure, side-effects, gene ontology, and targets) and three categories of 
disease-disease similarity (e.g., phenotypes, human phenotype ontology, and gene 
ontology). Then, associations between drug and disease were predicted using the 
employed similarity features. The prediction models were constructed using 
classification algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest and 
support vector machine algorithms. Upon cross-validation, the random forest 
approach showed the best performance (AUC = 0.948) and also performed well in an 
external validation assessment using an unseen independent dataset 
(AUC = 0.828). Finally, the constructed model was applied to predict potential 
indications for existing drugs and herbal compounds. As a result, new 
indications for 20 existing drugs and 31 herbal compounds were predicted and 
validated using clinical trial data.
CONCLUSIONS: The predicted results were validated manually confirming the 
performance and underlying mechanisms - for example, irinotecan as a treatment 
for neuroblastoma. From the prediction, herbal compounds were considered to be 
drug candidates for related diseases which is important to be further developed. 
The proposed prediction model can contribute to drug discovery by suggesting 
drug candidates from herbal compounds which have potentials but few were 
studied.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of leading 
malignant cancers of gastrointestinal tract worldwide. Until now, the involved 
mechanisms during the development of ESCC are largely unknown. This study aims 
to explore the driven-genes and biological pathways in ESCC.
METHODS: mRNA expression datasets of GSE29001, GSE20347, GSE100942, and 
GSE38129, containing 63 pairs of ESCC and non-tumor tissues data, were 
integrated and deeply analyzed. The bioinformatics approaches include 
identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and hub genes, gene 
ontology (GO) terms analysis and biological pathway enrichment analysis, 
construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and 
miRNA-gene network construction. Subsequently, GEPIA2 database and qPCR assay 
were utilized to validate the expression of hub genes. DGIdb database was 
performed to search the candidate drugs for ESCC.
RESULTS: Finally, 120 upregulated and 26 downregulated DEGs were identified. The 
functional enrichment of DEGs in ESCC were mainly correlated with cell cycle, 
DNA replication, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) mediated attractive 
signaling pathway, and Netrin-1 signaling pathway. The PPI network was 
constructed using STRING software with 146 nodes and 2392 edges. The most 
significant three modules in PPI were filtered and analyzed. Totally ten genes 
were selected and considered as the hub genes and nuclear division cycle 80 
(NDC80) was closely related to the survival of ESCC patients. DGIdb database 
predicted 33 small molecules as the possible drugs for treating ESCC.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the data may provide new insights into ESCC 
pathogenesis and treatments. The candidate drugs may improve the efficiency of 
personalized therapy in future.

Molecular profiling of tumor biopsies plays an increasingly important role not 
only in cancer research, but also in the clinical management of cancer patients. 
Multi-omics approaches hold the promise of improving diagnostics, prognostics 
and personalized treatment. To deliver on this promise of precision oncology, 
appropriate bioinformatics methods for managing, integrating and analyzing large 
and complex data are necessary. Here, we discuss the specific requirements of 
bioinformatics methods and software that arise in the setting of clinical 
oncology, owing to a stricter regulatory environment and the need for rapid, 
highly reproducible and robust procedures. We describe the workflow of a 
molecular tumor board and the specific bioinformatics support that it requires, 
from the primary analysis of raw molecular profiling data to the automatic 
generation of a clinical report and its delivery to decision-making clinical 
oncologists. Such workflows have to various degrees been implemented in many 
clinical trials, as well as in molecular tumor boards at specialized cancer 
centers and university hospitals worldwide. We review these and more recent 
efforts to include other high-dimensional multi-omics patient profiles into the 
tumor board, as well as the state of clinical decision support software to 
translate molecular findings into treatment recommendations.

Glioblastoma is an incurable brain cancer characterized by high genetic and 
pathological heterogeneity. Here, we mapped active chromatin landscapes with 
gene expression, whole exomes, copy number profiles, and DNA methylomes across 
44 patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), 50 primary tumors, and 10 
neural stem cells (NSCs) to identify essential super-enhancer (SE)-associated 
genes and the core transcription factors that establish SEs and maintain GSC 
identity. GSCs segregate into two groups dominated by distinct enhancer profiles 
and unique developmental core transcription factor regulatory programs. 
Group-specific transcription factors enforce GSC identity; they exhibit higher 
activity in glioblastomas versus NSCs, are associated with poor clinical 
outcomes, and are required for glioblastoma growth in vivo. Although 
transcription factors are commonly considered undruggable, group-specific 
enhancer regulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway predicts sensitivity to MEK 
inhibition. These data demonstrate that transcriptional identity can be 
leveraged to identify novel dependencies and therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Most lethal prostate cancers progress from relapse of aggressive 
primary disease. Recently, the most significant advances in survival benefit 
from systemic therapy have come from moving the administration of therapy to an 
earlier disease state. There is movement toward using biomarkers from the 
intraprostatic index lesion to guide early systemic therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the genomic heterogeneity, including the heterogeneity 
of predictive biomarkers, within the index focus of treatment-naïve prostate 
cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients with treatment-naïve prostate 
cancer underwent prostatectomy. DNA was extracted from 70 spatially distinct 
regions of the 10 index foci.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Single nucleotide mutations, 
small indels, and copy number changes were identified. Intrafocal genomic 
heterogeneity and heterogeneity of alterations that predict response to therapy 
was determined.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Exome sequencing and copy number estimates demonstrate 
branched evolution with >75% of point mutations being subclonal, including 
numerous pathways associated with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Seven of 
10 patients harbor alterations in one of five genes that predict response to 
targeted therapies with survival benefit in prostate cancer. Within 
biomarker-positive cases, 25% of intraprostatic regions are biomarker negative, 
with discordance between intraprostatic regions and lymph node metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-naïve, nonmetastatic prostate cancer has marked 
intrafocal heterogeneity. Numerous alterations in pathways associated with 
castration-resistant prostate cancer are present in subclonal populations, 
including biomarkers predictive of response to targeted therapy.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Untreated patients' tumors have alterations that predict 
response to targeted therapies, but the presence of a biomarker is dependent on 
what region of the tumor was evaluated.

Dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) have a well-known role as regulators of 
the immune response through the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases 
(MAPKs). Yet the precise interplay between the various members of the DUSP 
family with protein kinases is not well understood. Recent multi-omics studies 
characterizing the transcriptomes and proteomes of immune cells have provided 
snapshots of molecular mechanisms underlying innate immune response in 
unprecedented detail. In this study, we focus on deciphering the interplay 
between members of the DUSP family with protein kinases in immune cells using 
publicly available omics datasets. Our analysis resulted in the identification 
of potential DUSP-mediated hub proteins including MAPK7, MAPK8, AURKA, and 
IGF1R. Furthermore, we analyzed the association of DUSP expression with TLR4 
signaling and identified VEGF, FGFR, and SCF-KIT pathway modules to be regulated 
by the activation of TLR4 signaling. Finally, we identified several important 
kinases including LRRK2, MAPK8, and cyclin-dependent kinases as potential 
DUSP-mediated hubs in TLR4 signaling. The findings from this study have the 
potential to aid in the understanding of DUSP signaling in the context of innate 
immunity. Further, this will promote the development of therapeutic modalities 
for disorders with aberrant DUSP signaling.

Due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of cancer, it is still a challenge 
to predict the prognosis of cancer patients. In this work, we used a clustering 
algorithm to divide patients into different subtypes in order to reduce the 
heterogeneity of the cancer patients in each subtype. Based on the hypothesis 
that the gene co-expression network may reveal relationships among genes, some 
communities in the network could influence the prognosis of cancer patients and 
all the prognosis-related communities could fully reveal the prognosis of cancer 
patients. To predict the prognosis for cancer patients in each subtype, we 
adopted an ensemble classifier based on the gene co-expression network of the 
corresponding subtype. Using the gene expression data of ovarian cancer patients 
in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), three subtypes were identified. Survival 
analysis showed that patients in different subtypes had different survival 
risks. Three ensemble classifiers were constructed for each subtype. 
Leave-one-out and independent validation showed that our method outperformed 
control and literature methods. Furthermore, the function annotation of the 
communities in each subtype showed that some communities were cancer-related. 
Finally, we found that the current drug targets can partially support our 
method.

Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome that leads to significant weight 
loss. Cachexia affects 50%-80% of cancer patients, depending on the tumor type, 
and is associated with 20%-40% of cancer patient deaths. Besides the efforts to 
identify molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle atrophy-a key feature in cancer 
cachexia-no effective therapy for the syndrome is currently available. MicroRNAs 
are regulators of gene expression, with therapeutic potential in several muscle 
wasting disorders. We performed a meta-analysis of previously published gene 
expression data to reveal new potential microRNA-mRNA networks associated with 
muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia. We retrieved 52 differentially expressed 
genes in nine studies of muscle tissue from patients and rodent models of cancer 
cachexia. Next, we predicted microRNAs targeting these differentially expressed 
genes. We also include global microRNA expression data surveyed in atrophying 
skeletal muscles from previous studies as background information. We identified 
deregulated genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis, muscle hypertrophy, 
catabolism, and acute phase response. We further predicted new microRNA-mRNA 
interactions, such as miR-27a/Foxo1, miR-27a/Mef2c, miR-27b/Cxcl12, 
miR-27b/Mef2c, miR-140/Cxcl12, miR-199a/Cav1, and miR-199a/Junb, which may 
contribute to muscle wasting in cancer cachexia. Finally, we found drugs 
targeting MSTN, CXCL12, and CAMK2B, which may be considered for the development 
of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer cachexia. Our study has broadened the 
knowledge of microRNA-regulated networks that are likely associated with muscle 
atrophy in cancer cachexia, pointing to their involvement as potential targets 
for novel therapeutic strategies.

Knowledge of interaction network between different proteins can be a useful tool 
in cancer therapy. To develop new therapeutic treatments, understanding how 
these proteins contribute to dysregulated cellular pathways is an important 
task. PARP1 inhibitors are drugs used in cancer therapy, in particular where DNA 
repair is defective. It is crucial to find new candidate interactors of PARP1 as 
new therapeutic targets in order to increase efficacy of PARP1 inhibitors and 
expand their clinical utility. By a yeast-based genome wide screening, we 
previously discovered 90 candidate deletion genes that suppress 
growth-inhibition phenotype conferred by PARP1 in yeast. Here, we performed an 
integrated and computational analysis to deeply study these genes. First, we 
identified which pathways these genes are involved in and putative relations 
with PARP1 through g:Profiler. Then, we studied mutation pattern and their 
relation to cancer by interrogating COSMIC and DisGeNET database; finally, we 
evaluated expression and alteration in several cancers with cBioPortal, and the 
interaction network with GeneMANIA. We identified 12 genes belonging to 
PARP1-related pathways. We decided to further validate RIT1, INCENP and PSTA1 in 
MCF7 breast cancer cells. We found that RIT1 and INCENP affected PARylation and 
PARP1 protein level more significantly in PARP1 inhibited cells. Furthermore, 
downregulation of RIT1, INCENP and PSAT1 affected olaparib sensitivity of MCF7 
cells. Our study identified candidate genes that could have an effect on PARP 
inhibition therapy. Moreover, we also confirm that yeast-based screenings could 
be very helpful to identify novel potential therapy factors.

Computational analysis of human-virus protein-protein interaction (PPI) data is 
an effective way toward systems understanding the molecular mechanism of viral 
infection. Previous work has mainly focused on characterizing the global 
properties of viral targets within the entire human PPI network. In comparison, 
how viruses manipulate host local networks (e.g., human protein complexes) has 
been rarely addressed from a computational perspective. By mainly integrating 
information about human-virus PPIs, human protein complexes, and gene expression 
profiles, we performed a large-scale analysis of virally targeted complexes 
(VTCs) related to five common human-pathogenic viruses, including influenza A 
virus subtype H1N1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, Epstein-Barr virus, 
human papillomavirus, and hepatitis C virus. We found that viral targets are 
enriched within human protein complexes. We observed in the context of VTCs that 
viral targets tended to have a high within-complex degree and to be scaffold and 
housekeeping proteins. Complexes that are essential for viral propagation were 
simultaneously targeted by multiple viruses. We characterized the periodic 
expression patterns of VTCs and provided the corresponding candidates that may 
be involved in the manipulation of the host cell cycle. As a potential 
application of the current analysis, we proposed a VTC-based antiviral drug 
target discovery strategy. Finally, we developed an online VTC-related platform 
known as VTcomplex (http://zzdlab.com/vtcomplex/index.php or 
http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/vtcomplex/index.php). We hope that the current 
analysis can provide new insights into the global landscape of human-virus PPIs 
at the VTC level and that the developed VTcomplex will become a vital resource 
for the community. IMPORTANCE Although human protein complexes have been 
reported to be directly related to viral infection, previous studies have not 
systematically investigated human-virus PPIs from the perspective of human 
protein complexes. To the best of our knowledge, we have presented here the most 
comprehensive and in-depth analysis of human-virus PPIs in the context of VTCs. 
Our findings confirm that human protein complexes are heavily involved in viral 
infection. The observed preferences of virally targeted subunits within 
complexes reflect the mechanisms used by viruses to manipulate host protein 
complexes. The identified periodic expression patterns of the VTCs and the 
corresponding candidates could increase our understanding of how viruses 
manipulate the host cell cycle. Finally, our proposed conceptual application 
framework of VTCs and the developed VTcomplex could provide new hints to develop 
antiviral drugs for the clinical treatment of viral infections.

During morphogenesis, cells communicate with each other to shape tissues and 
organs. Several lines of recent evidence indicate that ion channels play a key 
role in cellular signaling and tissue morphogenesis. However, little is known 
about the scope of specific ion-channel types that impinge upon developmental 
pathways. The Drosophila melanogaster wing is an excellent model in which to 
address this problem as wing vein patterning is acutely sensitive to changes in 
developmental pathways. We conducted a screen of 180 ion channels expressed in 
the wing using loss-of-function mutant and RNAi lines. Here we identify 44 
candidates that significantly impacted development of the Drosophila 
melanogaster wing. Calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, and ligand-gated cation 
channels were all identified in our screen, suggesting that a wide variety of 
ion channel types are important for development. Ion channels belonging to the 
pickpocket family, the ionotropic receptor family, and the bestrophin family 
were highly represented among the candidates of our screen. Seven new ion 
channels with human orthologs that have been implicated in human channelopathies 
were also identified. Many of the human orthologs of the channels identified in 
our screen are targets of common general anesthetics, anti-seizure and 
anti-hypertension drugs, as well as alcohol and nicotine. Our results confirm 
the importance of ion channels in morphogenesis and identify a number of ion 
channels that will provide the basis for future studies to understand the role 
of ion channels in development.

The microenvironment plays a central role in cancer, and neoplastic cells 
actively shape it to their needs by complex arrays of extracellular matrix (ECM) 
proteins, enzymes, cytokines and growth factors collectively referred to as the 
matrisome. Studies on the cancer matrisome have been performed for single or few 
neoplasms, but a more systematic analysis is still missing. Here we present a 
Pan-Cancer study of matrisome gene expression in 10,487 patients across 32 tumor 
types, supplemented with transcription factors (TFs) and driver genes/pathways 
regulating each tumor's matrisome. We report on 919 TF-target pairs, either used 
specifically or shared across tumor types, and their prognostic significance, 40 
master regulators, 31 overarching regulatory pathways and the potential for 
druggability with FDA-approved cancer drugs. These results provide a 
comprehensive transcriptional architecture of the cancer matrisome and suggest 
the need for development of specific matrisome-targeting approaches for future 
therapies.

Systemic treatment options for soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) have remained 
unchanged despite the need for novel drug candidates to improve STS outcomes. 
Drug repurposing involves the application of clinical drugs to different 
diseases, reducing development time, and cost. It has also become a fast and 
effective way to identify drug candidates. The present study used a 
computational method to screen three drug‑gene interaction databases for novel 
drug candidates for the treatment of several common STS histologic subtypes 
through drug repurposing. STS survival‑associated genes were generated by 
conducting a univariate cox regression analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas 
survival data. These genes were then applied to three databases (the 
Connectivity Map, the Drug Gene Interaction Database and the L1000 Fireworks 
Display) to identify drug candidates for STS treatment. Additionally, pathway 
analysis and molecular docking were conducted to evaluate the molecular 
mechanisms of the candidate drug. Bepridil was identified as a potential 
candidate for several STS histologic subtype treatments by overlapping the 
screening results from three drug‑gene interaction databases. The pathway 
analysis with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes predicted that 
Bepridil may target CRK, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), laminin 
subunit β1 (LAMB1), phosphoinositide‑3‑kinase regulatory subunit 2 (PIK3R2), 
WNT5A, cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47), elastase, neutrophil expressed 
(ELANE), 15‑hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) and protein kinase cβ 
(PRKCB) to suppress STS development. Further molecular docking simulation 
suggested a relatively stable binding selectivity between Bepridil and eight 
proteins (CRK, FGFR4, LAMB1, PIK3R2, CD47, ELANE, HPGD, and PRKCB). In 
conclusion, a computational method was used to identify Bepridil as a potential 
candidate for the treatment of several common STS histologic subtypes. 
Experimental validation of these in silico results is necessary before clinical 
translation can occur.

The major depressive disorder (MDD) working group of the Psychiatric Genomics 
Consortium (PGC) has published a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for MDD in 
130,664 cases, identifying 44 risk variants. We used these results to 
investigate potential drug targets and repurposing opportunities. We built 
easily interpretable bipartite drug-target networks integrating interactions 
between drugs and their targets, genome-wide association statistics, and 
genetically predicted expression levels in different tissues, using the online 
tool Drug Targetor ( drugtargetor.com ). We also investigated drug-target 
relationships that could be impacting MDD. MAGMA was used to perform pathway 
analyses and S-PrediXcan to investigate the directionality of tissue-specific 
expression levels in patients vs. controls. Outside the major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) region, 153 protein-coding genes are significantly associated with 
MDD in MAGMA after multiple testing correction; among these, five are predicted 
to be down or upregulated in brain regions and 24 are known druggable genes. 
Several drug classes were significantly enriched, including monoamine reuptake 
inhibitors, sex hormones, antipsychotics, and antihistamines, indicating an 
effect on MDD and potential repurposing opportunities. These findings not only 
require validation in model systems and clinical examination, but also show that 
GWAS may become a rich source of new therapeutic hypotheses for MDD and other 
psychiatric disorders that need new-and better-treatment options.

BACKGROUND: A cancer cell line originating from human epithelial colorectal 
adenocarcinoma (Caco-2 cells) serves as a high capacity model for a preclinical 
screening of drugs. Recent need for incorporating barrier tissue into 
multi-organ chips calls for inclusion of Caco-2 cells into microperfused 
environment.
RESULTS: This article describes a series of systems biology insights obtained 
from comparing Caco-2 models cells grown as conventional 2D layer and in a 
microfluidic chip. When basic electrical parameters of Caco-2 monolayers were 
evaluated using impedance spectrometry and MTT assays, no differences were 
noted. On the other hand, the microarray profiling of mRNAs and miRNAs revealed 
that grows on a microfluidic chip leads to the change in the production of 
specific miRNA, which regulate a set of genes for cell adhesion molecules 
(CAMs), and provide for more complete differentiation of Caco-2 monolayer. 
Moreover, the sets of miRNAs secreted at the apical surface of Caco-2 monolayers 
grown in conventional 2D culture and in microfluidic device differ.
CONCLUSIONS: When integrated into a multi-tissue platform, Caco-2 cells may aid 
in generating insights into complex pathophysiological processes, not possible 
to dissect in conventional cultures.

Drug discovery typically involves investigation of a set of compounds (e.g. drug 
screening hits) in terms of target, disease, and bioactivity. CSgator is a 
comprehensive analytic tool for set-wise interpretation of compounds. It has two 
unique analytic features of Compound Set Enrichment Analysis (CSEA) and Compound 
Cluster Analysis (CCA), which allows batch analysis of compound set in terms of 
(i) target, (ii) bioactivity, (iii) disease, and (iv) structure. CSEA and CCA 
present enriched profiles of targets and bioactivities in a compound set, which 
leads to novel insights on underlying drug mode-of-action, and potential 
targets. Notably, we propose a novel concept of 'Hit Enriched Assays", i.e. 
bioassays of which hits are enriched among a given set of compounds. As an 
example, we show its utility in revealing drug mode-of-action or identifying 
hidden targets for anti-lymphangiogenesis screening hits. CSgator is available 
at http://csgator.ewha.ac.kr , and most analytic results are downloadable.

Breast cancer is the leading cause for mortality among women worldwide. 
Dysregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is the major reason for 
the cause of cancer. Understanding these genes will provide clues and insights 
about their regulatory mechanism and their interplay in cancer. In the present 
study, an attempt is made to compare the functional characteristics and 
interactions of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes to understand their 
biological role. 431 breast cancer samples from seven publicly available 
microarray datasets were collected and analysed using GEO2R tool. The identified 
416 differentially expressed genes were classified into five gene sets as 
oncogenes (OG), tumor suppressor genes (TSG), druggable genes, essential genes 
and other genes. The gene sets were subjected to various analysis such as 
enrichment analysis (viz., GO, Pathways, Diseases and Drugs), network analysis, 
calculation of mutation frequencies and Guanine-Cytosine (GC) content. From the 
results, it was observed that the OG were having high GC content as well as high 
interactions than TSG. Moreover, the OG are found to have frequent mutations 
than TSG. The enrichment analysis results suggest that the oncogenes are 
involved in positive regulation of cellular protein metabolic process, 
macromolecule biosynthetic process and majorly in cell cycle and focal adhesion 
pathway in cancer. It was also found that these oncogenes are involved in other 
diseases such as skin diseases and viral infections. Collagenase, paclitaxel and 
docetaxel are some of the drugs found to be enriched for oncogenes.

Major depression is a debilitating psychiatric illness that is typically 
associated with low mood and anhedonia. Depression has a heritable component 
that has remained difficult to elucidate with current sample sizes due to the 
polygenic nature of the disorder. To maximize sample size, we meta-analyzed data 
on 807,553 individuals (246,363 cases and 561,190 controls) from the three 
largest genome-wide association studies of depression. We identified 102 
independent variants, 269 genes, and 15 genesets associated with depression, 
including both genes and gene pathways associated with synaptic structure and 
neurotransmission. An enrichment analysis provided further evidence of the 
importance of prefrontal brain regions. In an independent replication sample of 
1,306,354 individuals (414,055 cases and 892,299 controls), 87 of the 102 
associated variants were significant after multiple testing correction. These 
findings advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of 
depression and provide several future avenues for understanding etiology and 
developing new treatment approaches.

The Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has substantially improved 
therapeutic options for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although ibrutinib 
is not curative, it has a profound effect on CLL cells and may create new 
pharmacologically exploitable vulnerabilities. To identify such vulnerabilities, 
we developed a systematic approach that combines epigenome profiling (charting 
the gene-regulatory basis of cell state) with single-cell chemosensitivity 
profiling (quantifying cell-type-specific drug response) and bioinformatic data 
integration. By applying our method to a cohort of matched patient samples 
collected before and during ibrutinib therapy, we identified characteristic 
ibrutinib-induced changes that provide a starting point for the rational design 
of ibrutinib combination therapies. Specifically, we observed and validated 
preferential sensitivity to proteasome, PLK1, and mTOR inhibitors during 
ibrutinib treatment. More generally, our study establishes a broadly applicable 
method for investigating treatment-specific vulnerabilities by integrating the 
complementary perspectives of epigenetic cell states and phenotypic drug 
responses in primary patient samples.

Identifying the hallmarks of cancer is essential for cancer research, and the 
genes involved in cancer hallmarks are likely to be cancer drivers. However, 
there is no appropriate method in the current literature for identifying genetic 
cancer hallmarks, especially considering the interrelationships among the genes. 
Here, we hypothesized that "dense clusters" (or "communities") in the gene 
co-expression networks of cancer patients may represent functional units 
regarding cancer formation and progression, and the communities present in the 
co-expression networks of multiple types of cancer may be cancer hallmarks. 
Consequently, we mined the conserved communities in the gene co-expression 
networks of seven cancers in order to identify candidate hallmarks. Functional 
annotation of the communities showed that they were mainly related to immune 
response, the cell cycle and the biological processes that maintain basic 
cellular functions. Survival analysis using the genes involved in the conserved 
communities verified that two of these hallmarks could predict the survival 
risks of cancer patients in multiple types of cancer. Furthermore, the genes 
involved in these hallmarks, one of which was related to the cell cycle, could 
be useful in screening for cancer drugs.

Breast cancer is a high-risk disease worldwide. For such complex diseases that 
are induced by multiple pathogenic genes, determining how to establish an 
effective drug discovery strategy is a challenge. In recent years, a large 
amount of genetic data has accumulated, particularly in the genome-wide 
identification of disorder genes. However, understanding how to use these data 
efficiently for pathogenesis elucidation and drug discovery is still a problem 
because the gene⁻disease links that are identified by high-throughput techniques 
such as phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) are usually too weak to have 
biological significance. Systems genetics is a thriving area of study that aims 
to understand genetic interactions on a genome-wide scale. In this study, we 
aimed to establish two effective strategies for identifying breast cancer genes 
based on the systems genetics algorithm. As a result, we found that the 
GeneRank-based strategy, which combines the prognostic phenotype-based 
gene-dependent network with the phenotypic-related PheWAS data, can promote the 
identification of breast cancer genes and the discovery of anti-breast cancer 
drugs.

BACKGROUND: The identification of prognostic genes that can distinguish the 
prognostic risks of cancer patients remains a significant challenge. Previous 
works have proven that functional gene sets were more reliable for this task 
than the gene signature. However, few works have considered the cross-talk among 
functional gene sets, which may result in neglecting important prognostic gene 
sets for cancer.
RESULTS: Here, we proposed a new method that considers both the interactions 
among modules and the prognostic correlation of the modules to identify 
prognostic modules in cancers. First, dense sub-networks in the gene 
co-expression network of cancer patients were detected. Second, cross-talk 
between every two modules was identified by a permutation test, thus generating 
the module network. Third, the prognostic correlation of each module was 
evaluated by the resampling method. Then, the GeneRank algorithm, which takes 
the module network and the prognostic correlations of all the modules as input, 
was applied to prioritize the prognostic modules. Finally, the selected modules 
were validated by survival analysis in various data sets. Our method was applied 
in three kinds of cancers, and the results show that our method succeeded in 
identifying prognostic modules in all the three cancers. In addition, our method 
outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the selected modules were 
significantly enriched with known cancer-related genes and drug targets of 
cancer, which may indicate that the genes involved in the modules may be drug 
targets for therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a useful method to identify key modules in cancer 
prognosis and our prognostic genes may be good candidates for drug targets.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify potential zinc status indicators and to 
clarify the mechanisms underlying zinc deficiency-induced organ damage and 
mortality in mice.
METHODS: The dataset GSE97112, including placental tissues of mice fed diets 
containing normal and low concentrations of zinc, was downloaded and 
preprocessed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were calculated and 
identified for zinc deficiency-related gene clusters by using the weighed gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm. The Gene Ontology 
(GO)-Biological Process (BP) and KEGG pathway of genes in the zinc 
deficiency-related WGCNA modules were analyzed, and the protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network was constructed. In addition, modules of the PPI 
network were identified, and transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs regulating 
DEGs were predicted. Finally, drug-gene interactions were selected.
RESULTS: A total of 1055 DEGs containing 586 up- and 469 down-regulated genes 
were obtained. Three modules based on WGCNA had high correlation with degree of 
zinc deficiency. Annexin A1 (ANXA1), C-C motif chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3), 
C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), and interleukin 2 (IL-2) were hub 
nodes in the PPI network. Three modules in the PPI network were identified, 
including module 1 associated with olfactory conduction and module 2 associated 
with inflammatory response. ANXA1, CCR3, and IL-2 were regulated by TFs. In 
addition, CXCR2, ANXA, and IL-2 were drug targets.
CONCLUSION: CXCR2, ANXA1, and CCR3 as well as olfactory receptor-related genes 
(proteins) may be used as biomarkers to assess zinc status in mice.

Prediction of response to specific cancer treatments is complicated by 
significant heterogeneity between tumors in terms of mutational profiles, gene 
expression, and clinical measures. Here we focus on the response of Estrogen 
Receptor (ER)+ post-menopausal breast cancer tumors to aromatase inhibitors 
(AI). We use a network smoothing algorithm to learn novel features that 
integrate several types of high throughput data and new cell line experiments. 
These features greatly improve the ability to predict response to AI when 
compared to prior methods. For a subset of the patients, for which we obtained 
more detailed clinical information, we can further predict response to a 
specific AI drug.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer among women 
worldwide. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the study of 
cancer across research labs around the globe; however, genomic testing in 
clinical settings remains limited. Advances in sequencing reliability, pipeline 
analysis, accumulation of relevant data, and the reduction of costs are rapidly 
increasing the feasibility of NGS-based clinical decision making.
METHODS: We report the development of MammaSeq, a breast cancer-specific NGS 
panel, targeting 79 genes and 1369 mutations, optimized for use in primary and 
metastatic breast cancer. To validate the panel, 46 solid tumors and 14 plasma 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) samples were sequenced to a mean depth of 2311× 
and 1820×, respectively. Variants were called using Ion Torrent Suite 4.0 and 
annotated with cravat CHASM. CNVKit was used to call copy number variants in the 
solid tumor cohort. The oncoKB Precision Oncology Database was used to identify 
clinically actionable variants. Droplet digital PCR was used to validate select 
ctDNA mutations.
RESULTS: In cohorts of 46 solid tumors and 14 ctDNA samples from patients with 
advanced breast cancer, we identified 592 and 43 protein-coding mutations. 
Mutations per sample in the solid tumor cohort ranged from 1 to 128 (median 3), 
and the ctDNA cohort ranged from 0 to 26 (median 2.5). Copy number analysis in 
the solid tumor cohort identified 46 amplifications and 35 deletions. We 
identified 26 clinically actionable variants (levels 1-3) annotated by OncoKB, 
distributed across 20 out of 46 cases (40%), in the solid tumor cohort. Allele 
frequencies of ESR1 and FOXA1 mutations correlated with CA.27.29 levels in 
patient-matched blood draws.
CONCLUSIONS: In solid tumor biopsies and ctDNA, MammaSeq detects clinically 
actionable mutations (OncoKB levels 1-3) in 22/46 (48%) solid tumors and in 4/14 
(29%) of ctDNA samples. MammaSeq is a targeted panel suitable for clinically 
actionable mutation detection in breast cancer.

Acetaminophen (APAP) is a commonly used analgesic responsible for more than half 
of acute liver failure cases. Identification of previously unknown genetic risk 
factors would provide mechanistic insights and novel therapeutic targets for 
APAP-induced liver injury. This study used a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to 
evaluate genes that are protective against, or cause susceptibility to, 
APAP-induced liver injury. HuH7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells containing 
CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockouts were treated with 15 mM APAP for 30 minutes to 4 
days. A gene expression profile was developed based on the 1) top screening 
hits, 2) overlap of expression data from APAP overdose studies, and 3) predicted 
affected biological pathways. We further demonstrated the implementation of 
intermediate time points for the identification of early and late response 
genes. This study illustrated the power of a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to 
systematically identify novel genes involved in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and 
to provide potential targets to develop novel therapeutic modalities.

BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by 
mutations in ATP7B encoding a copper transporter. Consequent copper accumulation 
results in a variable WD clinical phenotype involving hepatic, neurologic, and 
psychiatric symptoms, without clear genotype-phenotype correlations. The goal of 
this study was to analyze alterations in DNA methylation at the whole-genome 
level in liver and blood from patients with WD to investigate epigenomic 
alterations associated with WD diagnosis and phenotype. We used whole-genome 
bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to examine distinct cohorts of WD subjects to 
determine whether DNA methylation could differentiate patients from healthy 
subjects and subjects with other liver diseases and distinguish between 
different WD phenotypes.
RESULTS: WGBS analyses in liver identified 969 hypermethylated and 871 
hypomethylated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) specifically identifying 
patients with WD, including 18 regions with genome-wide significance. 
WD-specific liver DMRs were associated with genes enriched for functions in 
folate and lipid metabolism and acute inflammatory response and could 
differentiate early from advanced fibrosis in WD patients. Functional annotation 
revealed that WD-hypermethylated liver DMRs were enriched in liver-specific 
enhancers, flanking active liver promoters, and binding sites of liver 
developmental transcription factors, including Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 alpha 
(HNF4A), Retinoid X Receptor alpha (RXRA), Forkhead Box A1 (FOXA1), and FOXA2. 
DMRs associated with WD progression were also identified, including 15 with 
genome-wide significance. However, WD DMRs in liver were not related to 
large-scale changes in proportions of liver cell types. DMRs detected in blood 
differentiated WD patients from healthy and disease control subjects, and 
distinguished between patients with hepatic and neurologic WD manifestations. WD 
phenotype DMRs corresponded to genes enriched for functions in mental 
deterioration, abnormal B cell physiology, and as members of the polycomb 
repressive complex 1 (PRC1). 44 DMRs associated with WD phenotype tested in a 
small validation cohort had a predictive value of 0.9.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a disease-mechanism relevant epigenomic signature of 
WD that reveals new insights into potential biomarkers and treatments for this 
complex monogenic disease.

Increasing human life expectancy has posed increasing challenges for healthcare 
systems. As people age, they become more susceptible to chronic diseases, with 
an increasing burden of multimorbidity, and the associated polypharmacy. 
Accumulating evidence from work with laboratory animals has shown that ageing is 
a malleable process that can be ameliorated by genetic and environmental 
interventions. Drugs that modulate the ageing process may delay or even prevent 
the incidence of multiple diseases of ageing. To identify novel, anti-ageing 
drugs, several studies have developed computational drug-repurposing strategies. 
We review published studies showing the potential of current drugs to modulate 
ageing. Future studies should integrate current knowledge with multi-omics, 
health records, and drug safety data to predict drugs that can improve health in 
late life.

DNA sequencing has identified a limited number of driver mutations in metastatic 
breast cancer beyond single base-pair mutations in the estrogen receptor (ESR1). 
However, our previous studies and others have observed that structural variants, 
such as ESR1 fusions, may also play a role. Therefore, we expanded upon these 
observations by performing a comprehensive and highly sensitive characterization 
of copy-number (CN) alterations in a large clinical cohort of metastatic 
specimens. NanoString DNA hybridization was utilized to measure CN gains, 
amplifications, and deletions of 67 genes in 108 breast cancer metastases, and 
in 26 cases, the patient-matched primary tumor. For ESR1, a copyshift algorithm 
was applied to identify CN imbalances at exon-specific resolution and queried 
large data sets (>15,000 tumors) that had previously undergone next-generation 
sequencing (NGS). Interestingly, a subset of ER+ tumors showed increased ESR1 CN 
(11/82, 13%); three had CN amplifications (4%) and eight had gains (10%). 
Increased ESR1 CN was enriched in metastatic specimens versus primary tumors, 
and this was orthogonally confirmed in a large NGS data set. ESR1-amplified 
tumors showed a site-specific enrichment for bone metastases and worse outcomes 
than nonamplified tumors. No ESR1 CN amplifications and only one gain was 
identified in ER- tumors. ESR1 copyshift was present in 5 of the 11 
ESR1-amplified tumors. Other frequent amplifications included ERBB2, GRB7, and 
cell-cycle pathway members CCND1 and CDK4/6, which showed mutually exclusivity 
with deletions of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and CDKN1B. IMPLICATIONS: Copy-number 
alterations of ESR1 and key CDK pathway genes are frequent in metastatic breast 
cancers, and their clinical relevance should be tested further.

Substantial alterations at the multi-omics level of pancreatic cancer (PC) 
impede the possibility to diagnose and treat patients in early stages. Herein, 
we conducted an integrative omics-based translational analysis, utilizing 
next-generation sequencing, transcriptome meta-analysis, and 
immunohistochemistry, combined with statistical learning, to validate multiplex 
biomarker candidates for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of PC. 
Experiment-based validation was conducted and supportive evidence for the 
essentiality of the candidates in PC were found at gene expression or protein 
level by practical biochemical methods. Remarkably, the random forests (RF) 
model exhibited an excellent diagnostic performance and LAMC2, ANXA2, ADAM9, and 
APLP2 greatly influenced its decisions. An explanation approach for the RF model 
was successfully constructed. Moreover, protein expression of LAMC2, ANXA2, 
ADAM9, and APLP2 was found correlated and significantly higher in PC patients in 
independent cohorts. Survival analysis revealed that patients with high 
expression of ADAM9 (Hazard ratio (HR)OS = 2.2, p-value < 0.001), ANXA2 (HROS = 
2.1, p-value < 0.001), and LAMC2 (HRDFS = 1.8, p-value = 0.012) exhibited poorer 
survival rates. In conclusion, we successfully explore hidden biological 
insights from large-scale omics data and suggest that LAMC2, ANXA2, ADAM9, and 
APLP2 are robust biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and management for 
PC.

Despite the significant achievements in chemotherapy, cancer remains one of the 
leading causes of death. Target therapy revolutionized this field, but 
efficiencies of target drugs show dramatic variation among individual patients. 
Personalization of target therapies remains, therefore, a challenge in oncology. 
Here, we proposed molecular pathway-based algorithm for scoring of target drugs 
using high throughput mutation data to personalize their clinical efficacies. 
This algorithm was validated on 3,800 exome mutation profiles from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) project for 128 target drugs. The output values termed 
Mutational Drug Scores (MDS) showed positive correlation with the published drug 
efficiencies in clinical trials. We also used MDS approach to simulate all known 
protein coding genes as the putative drug targets. The model used was built on 
the basis of 18,273 mutation profiles from COSMIC database for eight cancer 
types. We found that the MDS algorithm-predicted hits frequently coincide with 
those already used as targets of the existing cancer drugs, but several novel 
candidates can be considered promising for further developments. Our results 
evidence that the MDS is applicable to ranking of anticancer drugs and can be 
applied for the identification of novel molecular targets.

BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive with limited 
treatment options upon recurrence. Molecular discordance between primary and 
metastatic TNBC has been observed, but the degree of biological heterogeneity 
has not been fully explored. Furthermore, genomic evolution through treatment is 
poorly understood. In this study, we aim to characterize the genomic changes 
between paired primary and metastatic TNBCs through transcriptomic and genomic 
profiling, and to identify genomic alterations which may contribute to 
chemotherapy resistance.
METHODS: Genomic alterations and mRNA expression of 10 paired primary and 
metastatic TNBCs were determined through targeted sequencing, microarray 
analysis, and RNA sequencing. Commonly mutated genes, as well as differentially 
expressed and co-expressed genes were identified. We further explored the 
clinical relevance of differentially expressed genes between primary and 
metastatic tumors to patient survival using large public datasets.
RESULTS: Through gene expression profiling, we observed a shift in TNBC subtype 
classifications between primary and metastatic TNBCs. A panel of eight cancer 
driver genes (CCNE1, TPX2, ELF3, FANCL, JAK2, GSK3B, CEP76, and SYK) were 
differentially expressed in recurrent TNBCs, and were also overexpressed in TCGA 
and METABRIC. CCNE1 and TPX2 were co-overexpressed in TNBCs. DNA mutation 
profiling showed that multiple mutations occurred in genes comprising a number 
of potentially targetable pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/MAPK, cell 
cycle, and growth factor receptor signaling, reaffirming the wide heterogeneity 
of mechanisms driving TNBC. CCNE1 amplification was associated with poor overall 
survival in patients with metastatic TNBC.
CONCLUSIONS: CCNE1 amplification may confer resistance to chemotherapy and is 
associated with poor overall survival in TNBC.

Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies. Two previous studies 
identified collagen type V alpha 2 (COL5A2) as a potential biomarker in BC, both 
are simple reanalysis of a single transcriptomic dataset without subgroup 
analysis for muscle-invasive BC (MIBC). We focused in MIBC patients and explored 
the role of COL5A2 from an integration perspective, using refined methodology 
covering individual participant data meta-analysis and bioinformatics analysis. 
Eight transcriptomic datasets of 787 MIBC patients (including one dataset 
containing genomic mutation information) and two drug sensitivity datasets of 29 
cell lines in which more than 250 compounds were analyzed. We found subjects 
with increased COL5A2 gene expression exhibited poorer prognosis, and the power 
analysis confirmed adequate sample size. FGFR3 was the only gene differential 
mutated between the COL5A2 high and low expression groups. Differential 
expression and co-expression network analysis suggested potential association 
between COL5A2 expression and essential pathways involved in cancer invasion and 
dissemination, including cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Coordinately, analysis of drug screening 
datasets and gene-drug interaction also revealed COL5A2 expression linked to 
cell morphogenesis, angiogenesis, blood vessel development, and urogenital 
development. The utility and feasibility of COL5A2 for clinically applicable 
prognosis prediction and risk classification and the exact underlying molecular 
mechanism should be further investigated in subsequent studies.

Advancing age is the dominant risk factor for most of the major killer diseases 
in developed countries. Hence, ameliorating the effects of ageing may prevent 
multiple diseases simultaneously. Drugs licensed for human use against specific 
diseases have proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in 
animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug repurposing in humans. 
New bioinformatic methods to identify and prioritise potential anti-ageing 
compounds for humans are therefore of interest. In this study, we first used 
drug-protein interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood of 
targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19 statistically 
significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to have pro-longevity properties in 
animal models (p < 0.001). Using the targets of each drug, we established their 
association with ageing at multiple levels of biological action including 
pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining all the data, 
we calculated a ranked list of drugs that identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor 
of HSP-90, as the top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate. We experimentally 
validated the pro-longevity effect of tanespimycin through its HSP-90 target in 
Caenorhabditis elegans.

As knowledge of the genetics behind inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has 
continually improved, there has been a demand for methods that can use this data 
in a clinically significant way. Genome-wide association analyses for IBD have 
identified 232 risk genetic loci for the disorder. While identification of these 
risk loci enriches our understanding of the underlying biology of the disorder, 
their identification does not serve a clinical purpose. A potential use of this 
genetic information is to look for potential IBD drugs that target these loci in 
a procedure known as drug repurposing. The demand for new drug treatments for 
IBD is high due to the side effects and high costs of current treatments. We 
hypothesize that IBD genetic variants obtained from GWAS and the candidate genes 
prioritized from the variants have a causal relationship with IBD drug targets. 
A computational drug repositioning study was done due to its efficiency and 
inexpensiveness compared to traditional in vitro or biochemical approaches. Our 
approach for drug repurposing was multi-layered; it not only focused on the 
interactions between drugs and risk IBD genes, but also the interactions between 
drugs and all of the biological pathways the risk genes are involved in. We 
prioritized IBD candidate genes using identified genetic variants and identified 
potential drug targets and drugs that can be potentially repositioned or 
developed for IBD using the identified candidate genes. Our analysis strategy 
can be applied to repurpose drugs for other complex diseases using their risk 
genes identified from genetic analysis.

In the last decade, genomics data have been largely adopted to sketch, study and 
better understand the complex mechanisms that underlie biological processes. The 
amount of publicly available data sources has grown accordingly, and several 
types of regulatory interactions have been collected and documented in 
literature. Unfortunately, often these efforts do not follow any data 
naming/interoperability/formatting standards, resulting in high-quality but 
often uninteroperable heterogeneous data repositories. To efficiently take 
advantage of the large amount of available data and integrate these 
heterogeneous sources of information, we built the RING (Regulatory Interaction 
Graph), an integrative standardized multilevel database of biological 
interactions able to provide a comprehensive and unmatched high-level 
perspective on several phenomena that take place in the regulatory cascade and 
that researchers can use to easily build regulatory networks around entities of 
interest.

Cancer comprises a set of more than 200 diseases resulting from the uncontrolled 
growth of cells that invade tissues and organs, which can spread to other 
regions of the body. The types of cancer found in humans are also described in 
animal models, a fact that has raised the interest of the scientific community 
in comparative oncology studies. In this study, bioinformatics tools were used 
to implement a computational model that uses text mining and natural language 
processing to construct a reference database that relates human and canine genes 
potentially associated with cancer, defining genetic pathways and information 
about cancer and cancer therapies. The CANCROX reference database was 
constructed by processing the scientific literature and lists more than 1300 
drugs and therapies used to treat cancer, in addition to over 10 000 
combinations of these drugs, including 40 types of cancer. A user-friendly 
interface was developed that enables researchers to search for different types 
of information about therapies, drug combinations, genes and types of cancer. In 
addition, data visualization tools allow to explore and relate different drugs 
and therapies for the treatment of cancer, providing information for groups 
studying animal models, in this case the dog, as well as groups studying cancer 
in humans.

Tumor genomic profiling involves analyzing many data types to produce a 
molecular profile of a tumor. Many of these analyses result in a prioritized 
list of genes or variants for further study. Interpretation of these lists 
relies upon annotating and extracting biological meaning through literature and 
manually curated knowledge bases. This chapter will describe several of these 
approaches including gene annotation, variant annotation, clinical annotation, 
functional enrichment analyses, and network analyses. Taken together or 
individually, these analyses will result in a biological understanding of 
complex genomic data to improve clinical decision making.

In this trans-ethnic multi-omic study, we reinterpret the genetic architecture 
of blood pressure to identify genes, tissues, phenomes and medication contexts 
of blood pressure homeostasis. We discovered 208 novel common blood pressure 
SNPs and 53 rare variants in genome-wide association studies of systolic, 
diastolic and pulse pressure in up to 776,078 participants from the Million 
Veteran Program (MVP) and collaborating studies, with analysis of the blood 
pressure clinical phenome in MVP. Our transcriptome-wide association study 
detected 4,043 blood pressure associations with genetically predicted gene 
expression of 840 genes in 45 tissues, and mouse renal single-cell RNA 
sequencing identified upregulated blood pressure genes in kidney tubule cells.

Osteosarcoma is a highly aggressive cancer for which treatment has remained 
essentially unchanged for more than 30 years. Osteosarcoma is characterized by 
widespread and recurrent somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA) and structural 
rearrangements. In contrast, few recurrent point mutations in protein-coding 
genes have been identified, suggesting that genes within SCNAs are key oncogenic 
drivers in this disease. SCNAs and structural rearrangements are highly 
heterogeneous across osteosarcoma cases, suggesting the need for a 
genome-informed approach to targeted therapy. To identify patient-specific 
candidate drivers, we used a simple heuristic based on degree and rank order of 
copy-number amplification (identified by whole-genome sequencing) and changes in 
gene expression as identified by RNA sequencing. Using patient-derived tumor 
xenografts, we demonstrate that targeting of patient-specific SCNAs leads to 
significant decrease in tumor burden, providing a road map for genome-informed 
treatment of osteosarcoma. SIGNIFICANCE: Osteosarcoma is treated with a 
chemotherapy regimen established 30 years ago. Although osteosarcoma is 
genomically complex, we hypothesized that tumor-specific dependencies could be 
identified within SCNAs. Using patient-derived tumor xenografts, we found a high 
degree of response for "genome-matched" therapies, demonstrating the utility of 
a targeted genome-informed approach.This article is highlighted in the In This 
Issue feature, p. 1.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is genetically complex with multifactorial etiology. 
Here, we aim to identify the potential viral pathogens leading to aberrant 
inflammatory and oxidative stress response in AD along with potential drug 
candidates using systems biology approach. We retrieved protein interactions of 
amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau protein (MAPT) from NCBI and genes for 
oxidative stress from NetAge, for inflammation from NetAge and InnateDB 
databases. Genes implicated in aging were retrieved from GenAge database and two 
GEO expression datasets. These genes were individually used to create 
protein-protein interaction network using STRING database (score≥0.7). The 
interactions of candidate genes with known viruses were mapped using virhostnet 
v2.0 database. Drug molecules targeting candidate genes were retrieved using the 
Drug- Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). Data mining resulted in 2095 APP, 116 
MAPT, 214 oxidative stress, 1269 inflammatory genes. After STRING PPIN analysis, 
404 APP, 109 MAPT, 204 oxidative stress and 1014 inflammation related high 
confidence proteins were identified. The overlap among all datasets yielded 
eight common markers (AKT1, GSK3B, APP, APOE, EGFR, PIN1, CASP8 and SNCA). These 
genes showed association with hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein- Barr virus 
(EBV), human herpes virus 8 and Human papillomavirus (HPV). Further, screening 
of drugs targeting candidate genes, and possessing anti-inflammatory property, 
antiviral activity along with a suggested role in AD pathophysiology yielded 12 
potential drug candidates. Our study demonstrated the role of viral etiology in 
AD pathogenesis by elucidating interaction of oxidative stress and inflammation 
causing candidate genes with common viruses along with the identification of 
potential AD drug candidates.

Japanese encephalitis is a zoonotic disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis 
virus (JEV). It is mainly epidemic in Asia with an estimated 69,000 cases 
occurring per year. However, no approved agents are available for the treatment 
of JEV infection, and existing vaccines cannot control various types of JEV 
strains. Drug repurposing is a new concept for finding new indication of 
existing drugs, and, recently, the concept has been used to discover new 
antiviral agents. Identifying host proteins involved in the progress of JEV 
infection and using these proteins as targets are the center of drug repurposing 
for JEV infection. In this study, based on the gene expression data of JEV 
infection and the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) data, we identified 
286 genes that participate in the progress of JEV infection using systems 
biology methods. The enrichment analysis of these genes suggested that the genes 
identified by our methods were predominantly related to viral infection pathways 
and immune response-related pathways. We found that bortezomib, which can target 
these genes, may have an effect on the treatment of JEV infection. Subsequently, 
we evaluated the antiviral activity of bortezomib using a JEV-infected mouse 
model. The results showed that bortezomib can lower JEV-induced lethality in 
mice, alleviate suffering in JEV-infected mice and reduce the damage in brains 
caused by JEV infection. This work provides an agent with new indication to 
treat JEV infection.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is one of the most common epithelial cell malignancies 
worldwide. However, its prognosis is poor. The aim of the present study was to 
examine the prognostic landscape and potential therapeutic targets for CCA. RNA 
sequencing data and clinical information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) dataset and processed. A total of 172 genes that were significantly 
associated with overall survival of patients with CCA were identified using the 
univariate Cox regression method. Bioinformatics tools were applied using the 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO). It was 
identified that 'Wnt signaling pathway', 'cytoplasm' and 'AT DNA binding' were 
the three most significant GO categories of CCA survival-associated genes. 
'Transcriptional misregulation in cancer' was the most significant pathway 
identified in the KEGG analysis. Using the Drug-Gene Interaction database, a 
drug-gene interaction network was constructed, and 31 identified genes were 
involved in it. The most meaningful potential therapeutic targets were selected 
via protein-protein and gene-drug interactions. Among these genes, polo-like 
kinase 1 (PLK1) was identified to be a potential target due to its significant 
upregulation in CCA. To rapidly find molecules that may affect these genes, the 
Connectivity Map was queried. A series of molecules were selected for their 
potential anti-CCA functions. 0297417-0002B and tribenoside exhibited the 
highest connection scores with PLK1 via molecular docking. These findings may 
offer novel insights into treatment and perspectives on the future innovative 
treatment of CCA.

We characterize different tumour types in search for multi-tumour drug targets, 
in particular aiming for drug repurposing and novel drug combinations. Starting 
from 11 tumour types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we obtain three clusters 
based on transcriptomic correlation profiles. A network-based analysis, 
integrating gene expression profiles and protein interactions of cancer-related 
genes, allows us to define three cluster-specific signatures, with genes 
belonging to NF-κB signaling, chromosomal instability, ubiquitin-proteasome 
system, DNA metabolism, and apoptosis biological processes. These signatures 
have been characterized by different approaches based on mutational, 
pharmacological and clinical evidences, demonstrating the validity of our 
selection. Moreover, we define new pharmacological strategies validated by in 
vitro experiments that show inhibition of cell growth in two tumour cell lines, 
with significant synergistic effect. Our study thus provides a list of genes and 
pathways that could possibly be used, singularly or in combination, for the 
design of novel treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Molecular precision oncology is an emerging practice to improve 
cancer therapy by decreasing the risk of choosing treatments that lack efficacy 
or cause adverse events. However, the challenges of integrating molecular 
profiling into routine clinical care are manifold. From a computational 
perspective these include the importance of a short analysis turnaround time, 
the interpretation of complex drug-gene and gene-gene interactions, and the 
necessity of standardized high-quality workflows. In addition, difficulties 
faced when integrating molecular diagnostics into clinical practice are ethical 
concerns, legal requirements, and limited availability of treatment options 
beyond standard of care as well as the overall lack of awareness of their 
existence.
METHODS: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group in Switzerland 
that established a workflow for personalized diagnostics based on comprehensive 
high-throughput sequencing of tumors at the clinic. Our workflow, named SwissMTB 
(Swiss Molecular Tumor Board), links genetic tumor alterations and gene 
expression to therapeutic options and clinical trial opportunities. The 
resulting treatment recommendations are summarized in a clinical report and 
discussed in a molecular tumor board at the clinic to support therapy decisions.
RESULTS: Here we present results from an observational pilot study including 22 
late-stage cancer patients. In this study we were able to identify actionable 
variants and corresponding therapies for 19 patients. Half of the patients were 
analyzed retrospectively. In two patients we identified resistance-associated 
variants explaining lack of therapy response. For five out of eleven patients 
analyzed before treatment the SwissMTB diagnostic influenced treatment decision.
CONCLUSIONS: SwissMTB enables the analysis and clinical interpretation of large 
numbers of potentially actionable molecular targets. Thus, our workflow paves 
the way towards a more frequent use of comprehensive molecular diagnostics in 
Swiss hospitals.

Large-scale genomic data highlight the complexity and diversity of the molecular 
changes that drive cancer progression. Statistical analysis of cancer data from 
different tissues can guide drug repositioning as well as the design of targeted 
treatments. Here, we develop an improved Bayesian network model for tumour 
mutational profiles and apply it to 8198 patient samples across 22 cancer types 
from TCGA. For each cancer type, we identify the interactions between mutated 
genes, capturing signatures beyond mere mutational frequencies. When comparing 
mutation networks, we find genes which interact both within and across cancer 
types. To detach cancer classification from the tissue type we perform de novo 
clustering of the pancancer mutational profiles based on the Bayesian network 
models. We find 22 novel clusters which significantly improve survival 
prediction beyond clinical information. The models highlight key gene 
interactions for each cluster potentially allowing genomic stratification for 
clinical trials and identifying drug targets.

Selecting the most appropriate protein sequences is critical for precision drug 
design. Here we describe Haplosaurus, a bioinformatic tool for computation of 
protein haplotypes. Haplosaurus computes protein haplotypes from pre-existing 
chromosomally-phased genomic variation data. Integration into the Ensembl 
resource provides rapid and detailed protein haplotypes retrieval. Using 
Haplosaurus, we build a database of unique protein haplotypes from the 1000 
Genomes dataset reflecting real-world protein sequence variability and their 
prevalence. For one in seven genes, their most common protein haplotype differs 
from the reference sequence and a similar number differs on their most common 
haplotype between human populations. Three case studies show how knowledge of 
the range of commonly encountered protein forms predicted in populations leads 
to insights into therapeutic efficacy. Haplosaurus and its associated database 
is expected to find broad applications in many disciplines using protein 
sequences and particularly impactful for therapeutics design.

The objective is to search potential therapeutic drugs for Parkinson's disease 
based on data mining and bioinformatics analysis and providing new ideas for 
research studies on "new application of conventional drugs." Method differential 
gene candidates were obtained based on data mining of genes of PD brain tissue, 
original gene data analysis, differential gene crossover, pathway enrichment 
analysis, and protein interaction, and potential therapeutic drugs for 
Parkinson's disease were obtained through drug-gene relationship. Result. 250 
common differential genes were obtained from 3 research studies, and 31 
differential gene candidates were obtained through gene enrichment analysis and 
protein interaction. 10 drugs such as metformin hydrochloride were directly or 
indirectly correlated to differential gene candidates. Conclusion. Potential 
therapeutic drugs that may be used for prevention and treatment of Parkinson's 
disease were discovered through data mining and bioinformatics analysis, which 
provided new ideas for research and development of drugs. Results showed that 
metformin hydrochloride and other drugs had certain therapeutical effect on 
Parkinson's disease, and melbine (DMBG) can be used for treatment of Parkinson's 
disease and type 2 diabetes patients.

Outcomes of anticancer therapy vary dramatically among patients due to diverse 
genetic and molecular backgrounds, highlighting extensive intertumoral 
heterogeneity. The fundamental tenet of precision oncology defines molecular 
characterization of tumors to guide optimal patient-tailored therapy. Towards 
this goal, we have established a compilation of pharmacological landscapes of 
462 patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs) across 14 cancer types, together with 
genomic and transcriptomic profiling in 385 of these tumors. Compared with the 
traditional long-term cultured cancer cell line models, PDCs recapitulate the 
molecular properties and biology of the diseases more precisely. Here, we 
provide insights into dynamic pharmacogenomic associations, including molecular 
determinants that elicit therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibitors, and the 
potential repurposing of ibrutinib (currently used in hematological 
malignancies) for EGFR-specific therapy in gliomas. Lastly, we present a 
potential implementation of PDC-derived drug sensitivities for the prediction of 
clinical response to targeted therapeutics using retrospective clinical studies.

BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma is characterized by substantial clinical 
heterogeneity. Despite intensive treatment, the survival rates of high-risk 
neuroblastoma patients are still disappointingly low. Somatic chromosomal copy 
number aberrations have been shown to be associated with patient outcome, 
particularly in low- and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma patients. To improve 
outcome prediction in high-risk neuroblastoma, we aimed to design a prognostic 
classification method based on copy number aberrations.
METHODS: In an international collaboration, normalized high-resolution DNA copy 
number data (arrayCGH and SNP arrays) from 556 high-risk neuroblastomas obtained 
at diagnosis were collected from nine collaborative groups and segmented using 
the same method. We applied logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression to 
identify genomic aberrations associated with poor outcome.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified two types of copy number aberrations that 
are associated with extremely poor outcome. Distal 6q losses were detected in 
5.9% of patients and were associated with a 10-year survival probability of only 
3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5% to 23.3%, two-sided P = .002). 
Amplifications of regions not encompassing the MYCN locus were detected in 18.1% 
of patients and were associated with a 10-year survival probability of only 5.8% 
(95% CI = 1.5% to 22.2%, two-sided P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Using a unique large copy number data set of high-risk 
neuroblastoma cases, we identified a small subset of high-risk neuroblastoma 
patients with extremely low survival probability that might be eligible for 
inclusion in clinical trials of new therapeutics. The amplicons may also 
nominate alternative treatments that target the amplified genes.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying drug therapeutic action and toxicity is 
crucial for the prevention and management of drug adverse reactions, and paves 
the way for a more efficient and rational drug design. The characterization of 
drug targets, drug metabolism proteins, and proteins associated to side effects 
according to their expression patterns, their tolerance to genomic variation and 
their role in cellular networks, is a necessary step in this direction. In this 
contribution, we hypothesize that different classes of proteins involved in the 
therapeutic effect of drugs and in their adverse effects have distinctive 
transcriptomics, genomics and network features. We explored the properties of 
these proteins within global and organ-specific interactomes, using multi-scale 
network features, evaluated their gene expression profiles in different organs 
and tissues, and assessed their tolerance to loss-of-function variants 
leveraging data from 60K subjects. We found that drug targets that mediate side 
effects are more central in cellular networks, more intolerant to 
loss-of-function variation, and show a wider breadth of tissue expression than 
targets not mediating side effects. In contrast, drug metabolizing enzymes and 
transporters are less central in the interactome, more tolerant to deleterious 
variants, and are more constrained in their tissue expression pattern. Our 
findings highlight distinctive features of proteins related to drug action, 
which could be applied to prioritize drugs with fewer probabilities of causing 
side effects.

BACKGROUND: The ability to predict the interaction of drugs with target proteins 
is essential to research and development of drug. However, the traditional 
experimental paradigm is costly, and previous in silico prediction paradigms 
have been impeded by the wide range of data platforms and data scarcity.
RESULTS: In this paper, we modeled the prediction of drug-target interactions as 
a binary classification task. Using transcriptome data from the L1000 database 
of the LINCS project, we developed a framework based on a deep-learning 
algorithm to predict potential drug target interactions. Once fully trained, the 
model achieved over 98% training accuracy. The results of our research 
demonstrated that our framework could discover more reliable DTIs than found by 
other methods. This conclusion was validated further across platforms with a 
high percentage of overlapping interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model's capacity of integrating transcriptome data from drugs 
and genes strongly suggests the strength of its potential for DTI prediction, 
thereby improving the drug discovery process.

Point mutations in cancer have been extensively studied but chromosomal gains 
and losses have been more challenging to interpret due to their unspecific 
nature. Here we examine high-resolution allelic imbalance (AI) landscape in 1699 
colorectal cancers, 256 of which have been whole-genome sequenced (WGSed). The 
imbalances pinpoint 38 genes as plausible AI targets based on previous 
knowledge. Unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and activation screens identified in 
total 79 genes within AI peaks regulating cell growth. Genetic and functional 
data implicate loss of TP53 as a sufficient driver of AI. The WGS highlights an 
influence of copy number aberrations on the rate of detected somatic point 
mutations. Importantly, the data reveal several associations between AI target 
genes, suggesting a role for a network of lineage-determining transcription 
factors in colorectal tumorigenesis. Overall, the results unravel the 
contribution of AI in colorectal cancer and provide a plausible explanation why 
so few genes are commonly affected by point mutations in cancers.

Here we report targeted sequencing of 83 genes using DNA from primary breast 
cancer samples from 625 postmenopausal (UBC-TAM series) and 328 premenopausal 
(MA12 trial) hormone receptor-positive (HR+) patients to determine interactions 
between somatic mutation and prognosis. Independent validation of prognostic 
interactions was achieved using data from the METABRIC study. Previously 
established associations between MAP3K1 and PIK3CA mutations with luminal A 
status/favorable prognosis and TP53 mutations with Luminal B/non-luminal 
tumors/poor prognosis were observed, validating the methodological approach. In 
UBC-TAM, NF1 frame-shift nonsense (FS/NS) mutations were also a poor outcome 
driver that was validated in METABRIC. For MA12, poor outcome associated with 
PIK3R1 mutation was also reproducible. DDR1 mutations were strongly associated 
with poor prognosis in UBC-TAM despite stringent false discovery correction 
(q = 0.0003). In conclusion, uncommon recurrent somatic mutations should be 
further explored to create a more complete explanation of the highly variable 
outcomes that typifies ER+ breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: We present a rare case where distant metastasis of a low grade 
bladder tumor was observed. We carried out detailed genomic analysis and cell 
based experiments on patient tumor samples to study tumor evolution, possible 
cause of disease and provide personalized treatment strategies.
CASE PRESENTATION: A man with a smoking history was diagnosed with a low-grade 
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and a concurrent high-grade upper urinary 
tract tumor. Seven years later he had a lung metastasis. We carried out exome 
sequencing on all the patient's tumors and peripheral blood (germline) to 
identify somatic variants. We constructed a phylogenetic tree to capture how the 
tumors are related and to identify somatic changes important for metastasis. 
Although distant metastasis of low-grade bladder tumor is rare, the somatic 
variants in the tumors and the phylogenetic tree showed that the metastasized 
tumor had a mutational profile most similar to the low grade urothelial 
carcinoma. The primary and the metastatic tumors shared several important 
mutations, including in the KMT2D and the RXRA genes. The metastatic tumor also 
had an activating MTOR mutation, which may be important for tumor metastasis. We 
developed a mutational signature to understand the biologic processes 
responsible for tumor development. The mutational signature suggests that the 
tumor mutations are associated with tobacco carcinogen exposure, which is 
concordant with the patient's smoking history. We cultured cells from the lung 
metastasis to examine proliferation and signaling mechanisms in response to 
treatment. The mTOR inhibitor Everolimus inhibited downstream mTOR signaling and 
induced cytotoxicity in the metastatic tumor cells.
CONCLUSION: We used genomic analysis to examine a rare case of low grade bladder 
tumor metastasis to distant organ (lung). Our analysis also revealed exposure to 
carcinogens found is tobacco as a possible cause in tumor development. We 
further validated that the patient might benefit from mTOR inhibition as a 
potential salvage therapy in an adjuvant or recurrent disease setting.

To identify genetic variation underlying atrial fibrillation, the most common 
cardiac arrhythmia, we performed a genome-wide association study of >1,000,000 
people, including 60,620 atrial fibrillation cases and 970,216 controls. We 
identified 142 independent risk variants at 111 loci and prioritized 151 
functional candidate genes likely to be involved in atrial fibrillation. Many of 
the identified risk variants fall near genes where more deleterious mutations 
have been reported to cause serious heart defects in humans (GATA4, MYH6, 
NKX2-5, PITX2, TBX5)1, or near genes important for striated muscle function and 
integrity (for example, CFL2, MYH7, PKP2, RBM20, SGCG, SSPN). Pathway and 
functional enrichment analyses also suggested that many of the putative atrial 
fibrillation genes act via cardiac structural remodeling, potentially in the 
form of an 'atrial cardiomyopathy'2, either during fetal heart development or as 
a response to stress in the adult heart.

The TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion is the most prevalent early driver gene activation 
in prostate cancers of European ancestry, while the fusion frequency is much 
lower in Africans and Asians. The genomic characteristics and mechanisms for 
patients lacking ERG fusion are still unclear. In this study, we systematically 
compared the characteristics of gene fusions, somatic mutations, copy number 
alterations and gene expression signatures between 201 ERG fusion positive and 
296 ERG fusion negative prostate cancer samples. Both common and group-specific 
genomic alterations were observed, suggesting shared and different mechanisms of 
carcinogenesis in prostate cancer samples with or without ERG fusion. The 
genomic alteration patterns detected in ERG-negative group showed similarities 
with 77.5% of tumor samples of African American patients. These results 
emphasize that genomic and gene expression features of the ERG-negative group 
may provide a reference for populations with lower ERG fusion frequency. While 
the overall expression patterns were comparable between ERG-negative and 
ERG-positive tumors, we found that genomic alterations could affect the same 
pathway through distinct genes in the same pathway in both groups of tumor 
types. Altogether, the genomic and molecular characteristics revealed in our 
study may provide new opportunities for molecular stratification of ERG-negative 
prostate cancers.

Modern phenotypic high-throughput screens (HTS) present several challenges 
including identifying the target(s) that mediate the effect seen in the screen, 
characterizing 'hits' with a polypharmacologic target profile, and 
contextualizing screen data within the large space of drugs and screening 
models. To address these challenges, we developed the Drug-Target Explorer. This 
tool allows users to query molecules within a database of experimentally-derived 
and curated compound-target interactions to identify structurally similar 
molecules and their targets. It enables network-based visualizations of the 
compound-target interaction space, and incorporates comparisons to 
publicly-available in vitro HTS datasets. Furthermore, users can identify 
molecules using a query target or set of targets. The Drug Target Explorer is a 
multifunctional platform for exploring chemical space as it relates to 
biological targets, and may be useful at several steps along the drug 
development pipeline including target discovery, structure-activity 
relationship, and lead compound identification studies.

BACKGROUND: While standard RNA expression tests stratify patients into risk 
groups, RNA-Seq can guide personalized drug selection based on expressed 
mutations, fusion genes, and differential expression (DE) between tumor and 
normal tissue. However, patient-matched normal tissue may be unavailable. 
Additionally, biological variability in normal tissue and technological biases 
may confound results. Therefore, we present normal expression reference data for 
two sequencing methods that are suitable for breast biopsies.
RESULTS: We identified breast cancer related and drug related genes that are 
expressed uniformly across our normal samples. Large subsets of these genes are 
identical for formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples and fresh frozen samples. 
Adipocyte signatures were detected in frozen compared to formalin samples, 
prepared by surgeons and pathologists, respectively. Gene expression confounded 
by adipocytes was identified using fat tissue samples. Finally, immune 
repertoire statistics were obtained for healthy breast, tumor and fat tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Our reference data can be used with patient tumor samples that are 
asservated and sequenced with a matching aforementioned method. Coefficients of 
variation are given for normal gene expression. Thus, potential drug selection 
can be based on confidently overexpressed genes and immune repertoire 
statistics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal expression from formalin and frozen healthy breast 
tissue samples using Roche Kapa RiboErase (total RNA) (19 formalin, 9 frozen) 
and Illumina TruSeq RNA Access (targeted RNA-Seq, aka TruSeq RNA Exome) (11 
formalin, 1 frozen), and fat tissue (6 frozen Access). Tumor DE using 10 
formalin total RNA tumor samples and 1 frozen targeted RNA tumor sample.

PURPOSE: Dramatic advances in our understanding of the molecular pathophysiology 
of cancer, along with a rapidly expanding portfolio of molecular targeted drugs, 
have led to a paradigm shift toward personalized, biomarker-driven cancer 
treatment. Here, we report the 2-year experience of the Comprehensive Cancer 
Center Freiburg Molecular Tumor Board (MTB), one of the first interdisciplinary 
molecular tumor conferences established in Europe. The role of the MTB is to 
recommend personalized therapy for patients with cancer beyond standard-of-care 
treatment.
METHODS: This retrospective case series includes 198 patients discussed from 
March 2015 through February 2017. The MTB guided individual molecular 
diagnostics, assessed evidence of actionability of molecular alterations, and 
provided therapy recommendations, including approved and off-label treatments as 
well as available matched clinical trials.
RESULTS: The majority of patients had metastatic solid tumors (73.7%), mostly 
progressive (77.3%) after a mean of 2.0 lines of standard treatment. Diagnostic 
recommendations resulted in 867 molecular diagnostic tests for 172 patients 
(five per case), including exome analysis in 36 cases (18.2%). With a median 
turnaround time of 28 days, treatment recommendations were given to 104 patients 
(52.5%). These included single-agent targeted therapies (42.3%), checkpoint 
inhibitors (37.5%), and combination therapies (18.3%). Treatment recommendations 
were implemented in 33 of 104 patients (31.7%), of whom 19 (57.6%) showed stable 
disease or partial response, including 14 patients (7.1% of the entire 
population) receiving off-label treatments.
CONCLUSION: Personalized extended molecular-guided patient care is effective for 
a small but clinically meaningful proportion of patients in challenging clinical 
situations. Limited access to targeted drugs, lack of trials, and submission at 
late disease stage prevents broader applicability, whereas genome-wide analyses 
are not a strict requirement for predictive molecular testing.

Breast cancer is a major public health problem which treatment needs new 
pharmacological options. In the last decades, during the postgenomic era new 
theoretical and technological tools that give us novel and promising ways to 
address these problems have emerged. In this work, we integrate several tools 
that exploit disease-specific experimental transcriptomic results in addition to 
information from biological and pharmacological data bases obtaining a 
contextual prioritization of pathways and drugs in breast cancer subtypes. The 
usefulness of these results should be evaluated in terms of drug repurposing in 
each breast cancer molecular subtype therapy. In favor of breast cancer 
patients, this methodology could be further developed to provide personalized 
treatment schemes. The latter are particularly needed in those breast cancer 
subtypes with limited therapeutic options or those who have developed resistance 
to the current pharmacological schemes.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple loci 
associated with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, but only a 
few of these loci are current targets for on-market medications. To identify 
drugs suitable for repurposing and their targets, we created 2 unique pipelines 
integrating public data on 49 coronary artery disease/myocardial 
infarction-genome-wide association studies loci, drug-gene interactions, side 
effects, and chemical interactions.
METHODS: We first used publicly available genome-wide association studies 
results on all phenotypes to predict relevant side effects, identified drug-gene 
interactions, and prioritized candidates for repurposing among existing drugs. 
Second, we prioritized gene product targets by calculating a druggability score 
to estimate how accessible pockets of coronary artery disease/myocardial 
infarction-associated gene products are, then used again the genome-wide 
association studies results to predict side effects, excluded loci with 
widespread cross-tissue expression to avoid housekeeping and genes involved in 
vital processes and accordingly ranked the remaining gene products.
RESULTS: These pipelines ultimately led to 3 suggestions for drug repurposing: 
pentolinium, adenosine triphosphate, and riociguat (to target CHRNB4, ACSS2, and 
GUCY1A3, respectively); and 3 proteins for drug development: LMOD1 (leiomodin 
1), HIP1 (huntingtin-interacting protein 1), and PPP2R3A (protein phosphatase 2, 
regulatory subunit b-double prime, α). Most current therapies for coronary 
artery disease/myocardial infarction treatment were also rediscovered.
CONCLUSIONS: Integration of genomic and pharmacological data may prove 
beneficial for drug repurposing and development, as evidence from our pipelines 
suggests.

Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposons are normally 
suppressed in somatic tissues mainly due to DNA methylation and antiviral 
defense. However, the mechanism to suppress L1s may be disrupted in cancers, 
thus allowing L1s to act as insertional mutagens and cause genomic rearrangement 
and instability. Whereas the frequency of somatic L1 insertions varies greatly 
among individual tumors, much remains to be learned about underlying genetic, 
cellular, or environmental factors. Here, we report multiple correlates of L1 
activity in stomach, colorectal, and esophageal tumors through an integrative 
analysis of cancer whole-genome and matched RNA-sequencing profiles. Clinical 
indicators of tumor progression, such as tumor grade and patient age, showed 
positive association. A potential L1 expression suppressor, TP53, was mutated in 
tumors with frequent L1 insertions. We characterized the effects of somatic L1 
insertions on mRNA splicing and expression, and demonstrated an increased risk 
of gene disruption in retrotransposition-prone cancers. In particular, we found 
that a cancer-specific L1 insertion in an exon of MOV10, a key L1 suppressor, 
caused exon skipping and decreased expression of the affected allele due to 
nonsense-mediated decay in a tumor with a high L1 insertion load. Importantly, 
tumors with high immune activity, for example, those associated with 
Epstein-Barr virus infection or microsatellite instability, tended to carry a 
low number of L1 insertions in genomes with high expression levels of L1 
suppressors such as APOBEC3s and SAMHD1 Our results indicate that cancer 
immunity may contribute to genome stability by suppressing L1 retrotransposition 
in gastrointestinal cancers.

INTRODUCTION: Oral mucositis (OM) is a major dose-limiting side effect of 
chemotherapy and radiation used in cancer treatment. Due to the complex nature 
of OM, currently available drug-based treatments are of limited efficacy.
OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were (i) to determine genes and molecular pathways 
associated with OM and wound healing using computational tools and publicly 
available data and (ii) to identify drugs formulated for topical use targeting 
the relevant OM molecular pathways.
METHODS: OM and wound healing-associated genes were determined by text mining, 
and the intersection of the two gene sets was selected for gene ontology 
analysis using the GeneCodis program. Protein interaction network analysis was 
performed using STRING-db. Enriched gene sets belonging to the identified 
pathways were queried against the Drug-Gene Interaction database to find drug 
candidates for topical use in OM.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified 447 genes common to both the "OM" and "wound 
healing" text mining concepts. Gene enrichment analysis yielded 20 genes 
representing six pathways and targetable by a total of 32 drugs which could 
possibly be formulated for topical application. A manual search on 
ClinicalTrials.gov confirmed no relevant pathway/drug candidate had been 
overlooked. Twenty-five of the 32 drugs can directly affect the PTGS2 (COX-2) 
pathway, the pathway that has been targeted in previous clinical trials with 
limited success.
CONCLUSIONS: Drug discovery using in silico text mining and pathway analysis 
tools can facilitate the identification of existing drugs that have the 
potential of topical administration to improve OM treatment.

BACKGROUND: Although large-scale, next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies of 
cancers hold promise for enabling precision oncology, challenges remain in 
integrating NGS with clinically validated biomarkers.
METHODS: To overcome such challenges, we utilized the Database of Evidence for 
Precision Oncology (DEPO) to link druggability to genomic, transcriptomic, and 
proteomic biomarkers. Using a pan-cancer cohort of 6570 tumors, we identified 
tumors with potentially druggable biomarkers consisting of drug-associated 
mutations, mRNA expression outliers, and protein/phosphoprotein expression 
outliers identified by DEPO.
RESULTS: Within the pan-cancer cohort of 6570 tumors, we found that 3% are 
druggable based on FDA-approved drug-mutation interactions in specific cancer 
types. However, mRNA/phosphoprotein/protein expression outliers and drug 
repurposing across cancer types suggest potential druggability in up to 16% of 
tumors. The percentage of potential drug-associated tumors can increase to 48% 
if we consider preclinical evidence. Further, our analyses showed co-occurring 
potentially druggable multi-omics alterations in 32% of tumors, indicating a 
role for individualized combinational therapy, with evidence supporting 
mTOR/PI3K/ESR1 co-inhibition and BRAF/AKT co-inhibition in 1.6 and 0.8% of 
tumors, respectively. We experimentally validated a subset of putative druggable 
mutations in BRAF identified by a protein structure-based computational tool. 
Finally, analysis of a large-scale drug screening dataset lent further evidence 
supporting repurposing of drugs across cancer types and the use of expression 
outliers for inferring druggability.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an integrated analysis platform can 
nominate multi-omics alterations as biomarkers of druggability and aid ongoing 
efforts to bring precision oncology to patients.

Numerous gene fusions have been uncovered across multiple cancer types. Although 
the ability to target several of these fusions has led to the development of 
some successful anti-cancer drugs, most of them are not druggable. Understanding 
the molecular pathways of a fusion is important in determining its function in 
oncogenesis and in developing therapeutic strategies for patients harboring the 
fusion. However, the molecular pathways have been elucidated for only a few 
fusions, in part because of the labor-intensive nature of the required 
functional assays. Therefore, we developed a domain-based network approach to 
infer the pathways of a fusion. Molecular interactions of a fusion are first 
predicted by using its protein domain composition, and its associated pathways 
are then inferred from these molecular interactions. We demonstrated the 
capabilities of this approach by primarily applying it to the well-studied 
BCR-ABL1 fusion. The approach was also applied to two undruggable fusions in 
sarcoma, EWS-FL1 and FUS-DDIT3. We successfully identified known genes and 
pathways associated with these fusions and satisfactorily validated these 
predictions using several benchmark sets. The predictions of EWS-FL1 and 
FUS-DDIT3 also correlate with results of high-throughput drug screening. To our 
best knowledge, this is the first approach for inferring pathways of fusions.

Genes do not work in isolation, but rather as part of networks that have many 
feedback and redundancy mechanisms. Studying the properties of genetic networks 
and how individual genes contribute to overall network functions can provide 
insight into genetically-mediated disease processes. Most analytical techniques 
assume a network topology based on normal state networks. However, gene 
perturbations often lead to the rewiring of relevant networks and impact 
relationships among other genes. We apply a suite of analysis methodologies to 
assess the degree of transcriptional network rewiring observed in different sets 
of melanoma cell lines using whole genome gene expression microarray profiles. 
We assess evidence for network rewiring in melanoma patient tumor samples using 
RNA-sequence data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We make a distinction 
between "unsupervised" and "supervised" network-based methods and contrast their 
use in identifying consistent differences in networks between subsets of cell 
lines and tumor samples. We find that different genes play more central roles 
within subsets of genes within a broader network and hence are likely to be 
better drug targets in a disease state. Ultimately, we argue that our results 
have important implications for understanding the molecular pathology of 
melanoma as well as the choice of treatments to combat that pathology.

Unveiling "Musica Universalis" of the Cell: A Brief History of Biological 
12-Hour Rhythms.

"Musica universalis" is an ancient philosophical concept claiming the movements 
of celestial bodies follow mathematical equations and resonate to produce an 
inaudible harmony of music, and the harmonious sounds that humans make were an 
approximation of this larger harmony of the universe. Besides music, 
electromagnetic waves such as light and electric signals also are presented as 
harmonic resonances. Despite the seemingly universal theme of harmonic resonance 
in various disciplines, it was not until recently that the same harmonic 
resonance was discovered also to exist in biological systems. Contrary to 
traditional belief that a biological system is either at stead-state or cycles 
with a single frequency, it is now appreciated that most biological systems have 
no homeostatic "set point," but rather oscillate as composite rhythms consisting 
of superimposed oscillations. These oscillations often cycle at different 
harmonics of the circadian rhythm, and among these, the ~12-hour oscillation is 
most prevalent. In this review, we focus on these 12-hour oscillations, with 
special attention to their evolutionary origin, regulation, and functions in 
mammals, as well as their relationship to the circadian rhythm. We further 
discuss the potential roles of the 12-hour clock in regulating hepatic 
steatosis, aging, and the possibility of 12-hour clock-based chronotherapy. 
Finally, we posit that biological rhythms are also musica universalis: whereas 
the circadian rhythm is synchronized to the 24-hour light/dark cycle coinciding 
with the Earth's rotation, the mammalian 12-hour clock may have evolved from the 
circatidal clock, which is entrained by the 12-hour tidal cues orchestrated by 
the moon.

The European Society for Medical Oncology defines rare cancers as 5 or fewer 
cases per 100,000 persons per year. For many rare cancers, no standard of care 
exists, and treatment is often extrapolated. Identifying potentially targetable 
genomic alterations in rare tumors is a rational approach to improving treatment 
options. We sought to catalog these mutations in rare tumors and to assess their 
clinical utility.For this retrospective analysis, we selected rare tumor 
patients from a dataset of patients who underwent clinical tumor genomic 
profiling. Sarcomas were excluded. To index potentially actionable alterations, 
patients' reports were reviewed for mutations in cancer-associated genes and 
pathways. Respective clinical records were abstracted to appraise the benefit of 
using a targeted therapy approach. Actionable alterations were defined as 
targeted by a drug available on-label, off-label, or in clinical trials.The 95 
patients analyzed had 40 different tumor subtypes, most common being adenoid 
cystic (13%), cholangiocarcinoma (7%), and metaplastic breast (6%). At least one 
genomic alteration was identified in 87 patients (92%). The most common 
identifiable mutations were in TP53 (23%), KRAS (10%), PIK3CA (9%), CDKN2A/B 
(8%), BRAF (7%), MLL (7%), and ARID1A (6%). Thirty-six patients (38%) with 21 
different tumors had at least one potentially actionable alteration. Thirteen 
patients received targeted therapy. Of these, 4 had a partial response, 6 had 
stable disease, and 3 had progressive disease as the best response.The addition 
of genomic profiling to management of rare cancers adds a potential line of 
therapy for cancers that have little or no standard of care. In our analysis, 
tumors with a BRAF alteration responded well to BRAF inhibitors. Mol Cancer

Molecular neurobiological insight into human nervous tissues is needed to 
generate next-generation therapeutics for neurological disorders such as chronic 
pain. We obtained human dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) samples from organ donors and 
performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the hDRG transcriptional landscape, 
systematically comparing it with publicly available data from a variety of human 
and orthologous mouse tissues, including mouse DRG (mDRG). We characterized the 
hDRG transcriptional profile in terms of tissue-restricted gene coexpression 
patterns and putative transcriptional regulators, and formulated an 
information-theoretic framework to quantify DRG enrichment. Relevant gene 
families and pathways were also analyzed, including transcription factors, 
G-protein-coupled receptors, and ion channels. Our analyses reveal an 
hDRG-enriched protein-coding gene set (∼140), some of which have not been 
described in the context of DRG or pain signaling. Most of these show conserved 
enrichment in mDRG and were mined for known drug-gene product interactions. 
Conserved enrichment of the vast majority of transcription factors suggests that 
the mDRG is a faithful model system for studying hDRG, because of evolutionarily 
conserved regulatory programs. Comparison of hDRG and tibial nerve 
transcriptomes suggests trafficking of neuronal mRNA to axons in adult hDRG, and 
are consistent with studies of axonal transport in rodent sensory neurons. We 
present our work as an online, searchable repository 
(https://www.utdallas.edu/bbs/painneurosciencelab/sensoryomics/drgtxome), 
creating a valuable resource for the community. Our analyses provide insight 
into DRG biology for guiding development of novel therapeutics and a blueprint 
for cross-species transcriptomic analyses.

OBJECTIVE: Antipsychotic drugs were incidentally discovered in the 1950s, but 
their mechanisms of action are still not understood. Better understanding of 
schizophrenia pathogenesis could shed light on actions of current drugs and 
reveal novel "druggable" pathways for unmet therapeutic needs. Recent 
genome-wide association studies offer unprecedented opportunities to 
characterize disease gene networks and uncover drug-disease relationships. 
Polygenic overlap between schizophrenia risk genes and antipsychotic drug 
targets has been demonstrated, but specific genes and pathways constituting this 
overlap are undetermined. Risk genes of polygenic disorders do not operate in 
isolation but in combination with other genes through protein-protein 
interactions among gene product.
METHOD: The protein interactome was used to map antipsychotic drug targets 
(N=88) to networks of schizophrenia risk genes (N=328).
RESULTS: Schizophrenia risk genes were significantly localized in the 
interactome, forming a distinct disease module. Core genes of the module were 
enriched for genes involved in developmental biology and cognition, which may 
have a central role in schizophrenia etiology. Antipsychotic drug targets 
overlapped with the core disease module and comprised multiple pathways beyond 
dopamine. Some important risk genes like CHRN, PCDH, and HCN families were not 
connected to existing antipsychotics but may be suitable targets for novel drugs 
or drug repurposing opportunities to treat other aspects of schizophrenia, such 
as cognitive or negative symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The network medicine approach provides a platform to collate 
information of disease genetics and drug-gene interactions to shift focus from 
development of antipsychotics to multitarget antischizophrenia drugs. This 
approach is transferable to other diseases.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second 
leading cause of cancer-related mortality because of its poor prognosis. 
Therefore, identifying targetable genetic mutations and mutational signatures 
associated with prognosis and treatment strategies are needed. Ultra-deep 
sequencing of 409 cancer genes using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue 
from 33 male patients with hepatitis B virus-associated HCC was performed to 
identify mutational signatures associated with the prognosis of HCC. A total of 
47 genes were found to be mutated in more than 10% of patients. Chromatin 
remodeling genes were overrepresented in the mutation profile. We found patient 
survival was associated with mutations in NOTCH1 and the nucleotide excision 
repair genes which have not been described previously in HCC. From the mutation 
profile, six patients were eligible for Sorafenib treatment. Among the remaining 
patients, 7 patients had mutations in genes that are targets for other cancer 
drugs and 16 patients had mutations in potentially targetable genes. Only one 
patient carried no potential drug target. We identified mutational signatures 
associated with the patient survival of HCC. The findings may facilitate 
identifying subgroups of patients with a poor prognosis as well as potential 
drug targets for use in personalized strategies for HCC treatment.

Efforts to maximize the indications potential and revenue from drugs that are 
already marketed are largely motivated by what Sir James Black, a Nobel 
Prize-winning pharmacologist advocated-"The most fruitful basis for the 
discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug". However, rational design 
of drug mixtures poses formidable challenges because of the lack of or limited 
information about in vivo cell regulation, mechanisms of genetic pathway 
activation, and in vivo pathway interactions. Hence, most of the successfully 
repositioned drugs are the result of "serendipity", discovered during late phase 
clinical studies of unexpected but beneficial findings. The connections between 
drug candidates and their potential adverse drug reactions or new applications 
are often difficult to foresee because the underlying mechanism associating them 
is largely unknown, complex, or dispersed and buried in silos of information. 
Discovery of such multi-domain pharmacomodules-pharmacologically relevant 
sub-networks of biomolecules and/or pathways-from collection of databases by 
independent/simultaneous mining of multiple datasets is an active area of 
research. Here, while presenting some of the promising bioinformatics approaches 
and pipelines, we summarize and discuss the current and evolving landscape of 
computational drug repositioning.

The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced 
acute lung injury (ALI) and identify more effective therapeutic strategies to 
treat it. The gene expression data set GSE10474 was downloaded and assessed to 
identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Principal component analysis, 
functional enrichment analysis and differential co-expression analysis of DEGs 
were performed. Furthermore, potential target drugs for key DEGs were assessed. 
A total of 209 DEGs, including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes were 
screened. A number of DEGs, including zinc finger and BTB domain containing 17 
(ZBTB17), heat shock protein 90 kDa β, member 1 (HSP90B1) and major 
histocompatibility complex, class II, DR α were identified. Furthermore, gene 
ontology terms including antigen processing and presentation, 
glycerophospholipid metabolism, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, thyroid 
hormone synthesis and pathways associated with diseases, such as asthma were 
identified. In addition, a differential co-expression network containing 
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D4, putative and tubulin, γ complex associated 
protein 3 was constructed. Furthermore, a number of gene-drug interactions, 
including between HSP90B1 and adenosine-5'-diphosphate and radicicol, were 
identified. Therefore, DEGs, including ZBTB17 and HSP90B1, may be important in 
the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. Furthermore, drugs including 
adenosine-5'-diphosphate may be novel drug candidates to treat patients with 
ALI.

BACKGROUND: Large-sequencing cancer genome projects have shown that tumors have 
thousands of molecular alterations and their frequency is highly heterogeneous. 
In such scenarios, physicians and oncologists routinely face lists of cancer 
genomic alterations where only a minority of them are relevant biomarkers to 
drive clinical decision-making. For this reason, the medical community agrees on 
the urgent need of methodologies to establish the relevance of tumor 
alterations, assisting in genomic profile interpretation, and, more importantly, 
to prioritize those that could be clinically actionable for cancer therapy.
RESULTS: We present PanDrugs, a new computational methodology to guide the 
selection of personalized treatments in cancer patients using the variant lists 
provided by genome-wide sequencing analyses. PanDrugs offers the largest 
database of drug-target associations available from well-known targeted 
therapies to preclinical drugs. Scoring data-driven gene cancer relevance and 
drug feasibility PanDrugs interprets genomic alterations and provides a 
prioritized evidence-based list of anticancer therapies. Our tool represents the 
first drug prescription strategy applying a rational based on pathway context, 
multi-gene markers impact and information provided by functional experiments. 
Our approach has been systematically applied to TCGA patients and successfully 
validated in a cancer case study with a xenograft mouse model demonstrating its 
utility.
CONCLUSIONS: PanDrugs is a feasible method to identify potentially druggable 
molecular alterations and prioritize drugs to facilitate the interpretation of 
genomic landscape and clinical decision-making in cancer patients. Our approach 
expands the search of druggable genomic alterations from the concept of cancer 
driver genes to the druggable pathway context extending anticancer therapeutic 
options beyond already known cancer genes. The methodology is public and easily 
integratable with custom pipelines through its programmatic API or its docker 
image. The PanDrugs webtool is freely accessible at http://www.pandrugs.org .

Recent studies have revealed the importance of rare variants in myocardial 
infarction (MI) susceptibility in European populations. Because genetic 
architectures vary in different populations, we investigated how they contribute 
to MI susceptibility in Japanese subjects. We performed targeted sequencing of 
36 coronary artery disease risk genes, identified by genome-wide association 
studies, in 9,956 cases and 8,373 controls. Gene-based association tests 
identified significant enrichment of rare variants in LDLR and PCSK9 in MI 
cases. We identified 52 (novel 22) LDLR variants predicted to be damaging. 
Carriers of these variants showed a higher risk of MI (carriers/non-carriers 
89/9867 in cases, 17/8356 controls, OR = 4.4, P = 7.2 × 10-10), higher 
LDL-cholesterol levels and younger age of onset for MI. With respect to PCSK9, 
E32K carriers showed higher LDL-cholesterol levels and younger age of onset for 
MI, whereas R93C carriers had lower LDL-cholesterol levels. A significant 
correlation between LDL-cholesterol levels and onset age of MI was observed in 
these variant carriers. In good agreement with previous studies in patients with 
familial hypercholesterolaemia, our study in the Japanese general population 
showed that rare variants in LDLR and PCSK9 were associated with the onset age 
of MI by altering LDL-cholesterol levels.

BACKGROUND: The right drug to the right patient at the right time is one of the 
ideals of Individualized Medicine (IM) and remains one of the most compelling 
promises of the post-genomic age. The addition of genomic information is 
expected to increase the precision of an individual patient's treatment, 
resulting in improved outcomes. While pilot studies have been encouraging, key 
aspects of interpreting tumor genomics information, such as somatic activation 
of drug transport or metabolism, have not been systematically evaluated.
METHODS: In this work, we developed a simple rule-based approach to classify the 
therapies administered to each patient from The Cancer Genome Atlas PanCancer 
dataset (n = 2858) as effective or ineffective. Our Therapy Efficacy model used 
each patient's drug target and pharmacokinetic (PK) gene expression profile; the 
specific genes considered for each patient depended on the therapies they 
received. Patients who received predictably ineffective therapies were 
considered at high-risk of cancer-related mortality and those who did not 
receive ineffective therapies were considered at low-risk. The utility of our 
Therapy Efficacy model was assessed using per-cancer and pan-cancer differential 
survival.
RESULTS: Our simple rule-based Therapy Efficacy model classified 143 (5%) 
patients as high-risk. High-risk patients had age ranges comparable to low-risk 
patients of the same cancer type and tended to be later stage and higher grade 
(odds ratios of 1.6 and 1.4, respectively). A significant pan-cancer association 
was identified between predictions of our Therapy Efficacy model and poorer 
overall survival (hazard ratio, HR = 1.47, p = 6.3 × 10- 3). Individually, drug 
export (HR = 1.49, p = 4.70 × 10- 3) and drug metabolism (HR = 1.73, 
p = 9.30 × 10- 5) genes demonstrated significant survival associations. Survival 
associations for target gene expression are mechanism-dependent. Similar results 
were observed for event-free survival.
CONCLUSIONS: While the resolution of clinical information within the dataset is 
not ideal, and modeling the relative contribution of each gene to the activity 
of each therapy remains a challenge, our approach demonstrates that somatic PK 
alterations should be integrated into the interpretation of somatic 
transcriptomic profiles as they likely have a significant impact on the survival 
of specific patients. We believe that this approach will aid the prospective 
design of personalized therapeutic strategies.

SUMMARY: Individual tumor genomes pose a major challenge for clinical 
interpretation due to their unique sets of acquired mutations. There is a 
general scarcity of tools that can (i) systematically interrogate cancer genomes 
in the context of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers, (ii) 
prioritize and highlight the most important findings and (iii) present the 
results in a format accessible to clinical experts. We have developed a 
stand-alone, open-source software package for somatic variant annotation that 
integrates a comprehensive set of knowledge resources related to tumor biology 
and therapeutic biomarkers, both at the gene and variant level. Our application 
generates a tiered report that will aid the interpretation of individual cancer 
genomes in a clinical setting.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is implemented in Python/R, and is 
freely available through Docker technology. Documentation, example reports, and 
installation instructions are accessible via the project GitHub page:

Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes irreversible tissue damage and severe loss of 
neurological function. Currently, there are no approved treatments and very few 
therapeutic targets are under investigation. Here, we combined 4 high-throughput 
transcriptomics and proteomics datasets, 7 days and 8 weeks following 
clinically-relevant rat SCI to identify proteins with persistent differential 
expression post-injury. Out of thousands of differentially regulated entities 
our combined analysis identified 40 significantly upregulated versus 48 
significantly downregulated molecules, which were persistently altered at the 
mRNA and protein level, 7 days and 8 weeks post-SCI. Bioinformatics analysis was 
then utilized to identify currently available drugs with activity against the 
filtered molecules and to isolate proteins with known or unknown function in 
SCI. Our findings revealed multiple overlooked therapeutic candidates with 
important bioactivity and established druggability but with unknown expression 
and function in SCI including the upregulated purine nucleoside phosphorylase 
(PNP), cathepsins A, H, Z (CTSA, CTSH, CTSZ) and proteasome protease PSMB10, as 
well as the downregulated ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), malic enzyme (ME1) and 
sodium-potassium ATPase (ATP1A3), amongst others. This work reveals previously 
unappreciated therapeutic candidates for SCI and available drugs, thus providing 
a valuable resource for further studies and potential repurposing of existing 
therapeutics for SCI.

BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing technologies have been an increasingly 
critical aspect of precision medicine owing to a better identification of 
disease targets, which contributes to improved health care cost and clinical 
outcomes. In particular, disease-oriented targeted enrichment sequencing is 
becoming a widely-accepted application for diagnostic purposes, which can 
interrogate known diagnostic variants as well as identify novel biomarkers from 
panels of entire human coding exome or disease-associated genes.
RESULTS: We introduce a workflow named VAReporter to facilitate the management 
of variant assessment in disease-targeted sequencing, the identification of 
pathogenic variants, the interpretation of biological effects and the 
prioritization of clinically actionable targets. State-of-art algorithms that 
account for mutation phenotypes are used to rank the importance of mutated genes 
through visual analytic strategies. We established an extensive annotation 
source by integrating a wide variety of biomedical databases and followed the 
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for 
interpretation and reporting of sequence variations.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, VAReporter is the first web server designed to provide 
a "one-stop" resource for individual's diagnosis and large-scale cohort studies, 
and is freely available at http://rnd.cgu.edu.tw/vareporter .

Several reviews and case reports have described how information derived from the 
analysis of genomes are currently included in electronic health records (EHRs) 
for the purposes of supporting clinical decisions. Since the introduction of 
this new type of information in EHRs is relatively new (for instance, the 
widespread adoption of EHRs in the United States is just about a decade old), it 
is not surprising that a myriad of approaches has been attempted, with various 
degrees of success. EHR systems undergo much customization to fit the needs of 
health systems; these approaches have been varied and not always generalizable. 
The intent of this article is to present a high-level view of these approaches, 
emphasizing the functionality that they are trying to achieve, and not to 
advocate for specific solutions, which may become obsolete soon after this 
review is published. We start by broadly defining the end goal of including 
genomics in EHRs for healthcare and then explaining the various sources of 
information that need to be linked to arrive at a clinically actionable genomics 
analysis using a pharmacogenomics example. In addition, we include discussions 
on open issues and a vision for the next generation systems that integrate whole 
genome sequencing and EHRs in a seamless fashion.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common illness accompanied by considerable 
morbidity, mortality, costs, and heightened risk of suicide. We conducted a 
genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 
controls and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic 
findings were associated with clinical features of major depression and 
implicated brain regions exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of 
antidepressant medications and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for 
smaller association signal. We found important relationships of genetic risk for 
major depression with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: 
lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal, 
whereas major depression and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological 
etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for 
major depression. These findings help refine the basis of major depression and 
imply that a continuous measure of risk underlies the clinical phenotype.

Explaining the genetics of many diseases is challenging because most 
associations localize to incompletely characterized regulatory regions. Using 
new computational methods, we show that transcription factors (TFs) occupy 
multiple loci associated with individual complex genetic disorders. Application 
to 213 phenotypes and 1,544 TF binding datasets identified 2,264 relationships 
between hundreds of TFs and 94 phenotypes, including androgen receptor in 
prostate cancer and GATA3 in breast cancer. Strikingly, nearly half of systemic 
lupus erythematosus risk loci are occupied by the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA2 
protein and many coclustering human TFs, showing gene-environment interaction. 
Similar EBNA2-anchored associations exist in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis and celiac disease. Instances of allele-dependent DNA binding and 
downstream effects on gene expression at plausibly causal variants support 
genetic mechanisms dependent on EBNA2. Our results nominate mechanisms that 
operate across risk loci within disease phenotypes, suggesting new models for 
disease origins.

We aimed to understand the molecular changes in host cells that accompany 
infection by the seasonal influenza A H1N1 virus because the initial response 
rapidly changes owing to the fact that the virus has a robust initial 
propagation phase. Human epithelial alveolar A549 cells were infected and total 
RNA was extracted at 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, and 48 h post infection 
(h.p.i.). The differentially expressed host genes were clustered into two 
distinct sets of genes as the infection progressed over time. The patterns of 
expression were significantly different at the early stages of infection. One of 
the responses showed roles similar to those associated with the enrichment gene 
sets to known 'gp120 pathway in HIV.' This gene set contains genes known to play 
roles in preventing the progress of apoptosis, which infected cells undergo as a 
response to viral infection. The other gene set showed enrichment of 'Drug 
Metabolism Enzymes (DMEs).' The identification of two distinct gene sets 
indicates that the virus regulates the cell's mechanisms to create a favorable 
environment for its stable replication and protection of gene metabolites within 
8 h.

BACKGROUND: With the advancement of next generation sequencing technology, 
researchers are now able to identify important variants and structural changes 
in DNA and RNA in cancer patient samples. With this information, we can now 
correlate specific variants and/or structural changes with actionable 
therapeutics known to inhibit these variants. We introduce the creation of the 
IMPACT Web Portal, a new online resource that connects molecular profiles of 
tumors to approved drugs, investigational therapeutics and pharmacogenetics 
associated drugs.
RESULTS: IMPACT Web Portal contains a total of 776 drugs connected to 1326 
target genes and 435 target variants, fusion, and copy number alterations. The 
online IMPACT Web Portal allows users to search for various genetic alterations 
and connects them to three levels of actionable therapeutics. The results are 
categorized into 3 levels: Level 1 contains approved drugs separated into two 
groups; Level 1A contains approved drugs with variant specific information while 
Level 1B contains approved drugs with gene level information. Level 2 contains 
drugs currently in oncology clinical trials. Level 3 provides pharmacogenetic 
associations between approved drugs and genes.
CONCLUSION: IMPACT Web Portal allows for sequencing data to be linked to 
actionable therapeutics for translational and drug repurposing research. The 
IMPACT Web Portal online resource allows users to query genes and variants to 
approved and investigational drugs. We envision that this resource will be a 
valuable database for personalized medicine and drug repurposing. IMPACT Web 
Portal is freely available for non-commercial use at 
http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/IMPACT .

Brain metastases constitute a challenge in the management of patients with 
HER2-positive breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 systemic therapies. Here we 
sought to define the repertoire of mutations private to or enriched for in 
HER2-positive brain metastases. Massively parallel sequencing targeting all 
exons of 254 genes frequently mutated in breast cancers and/or related to DNA 
repair was used to characterize the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of 
HER2-positive breast cancers and their brain metastases in six patients. Data 
were analyzed with state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithms and selected 
mutations were validated with orthogonal methods. Spatial and temporal 
inter-lesion genetic heterogeneity was observed in the HER2-positive brain 
metastases from an index patient subjected to a rapid autopsy. Genetic 
alterations restricted to the brain metastases included mutations in cancer 
genes FGFR2, PIK3CA and ATR, homozygous deletion in CDKN2A and amplification in 
KRAS. Shifts in clonal composition and the acquisition of additional mutations 
in the progression from primary HER2-positive breast cancer to brain metastases 
following anti-HER2 therapy were investigated in additional five patients. 
Likely pathogenic mutations private to or enriched in the brain lesions affected 
cancer and clinically actionable genes, including ATR, BRAF, FGFR2, MAP2K4, 
PIK3CA, RAF1 and TP53. Changes in clonal composition and the acquisition of 
additional mutations in brain metastases may affect potentially actionable genes 
in HER2-positive breast cancers. Our observations have potential clinical 
implications, given that treatment decisions for patients with brain metastatic 
disease are still mainly based on biomarkers assessed in the primary tumor.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is the principal modifiable environmental risk factor for 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which affects 300 million people 
and is the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide. Most of the genetic studies of 
smoking have relied on self-reported smoking status which is vulnerable to 
reporting and recall bias. Using data from the Lung Health Study (LHS), we 
sought to identify genetic variants associated with quantitative smoking and 
cessation in individuals with mild to moderate COPD.
METHODS: The LHS is a longitudinal multicenter study of mild-to-moderate COPD 
subjects who were all smokers at recruitment. We performed genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) for salivary cotinine (n = 4024), exhaled carbon 
monoxide (eCO) (n = 2854), cigarettes per day (CPD) (n = 2706) and smoking 
cessation at year 5 follow-up (n = 717 quitters and 2175 smokers). The GWAS 
analyses were adjusted for age, gender, and genetic principal components.
RESULTS: For cotinine levels, SNPs near UGT2B10 gene achieved genome-wide 
significance (i.e. P < 5 × 10- 8) with top SNP rs10023464, P = 1.27 × 10- 11. 
For eCO levels, one significant SNP was identified which mapped to the CHRNA3 
gene (rs12914385, P = 2.38 × 10- 8). A borderline region mapping to KCNMA1 gene 
was associated with smoking cessation (rs207675, P = 5.95 × 10- 8). Of the 
identified loci, only the CHRNA3/5 locus showed significant associations with 
lung function but only in heavy smokers. No regions met genome-wide significance 
for CPD.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that using objective measures of smoking such 
as eCO and/or salivary cotinine can more precisely capture the genetic 
contribution to multiple aspects of smoking behaviour. The KCNMA1 gene 
association with smoking cessation may represent a potential therapeutic target 
and warrants further studies.

Malignant breast cancer remains a major health threat to women of all ages 
worldwide and epigenetic variations on DNA methylation have been widely reported 
in cancers of different types. We profiled DNA methylation with ERRBS (Enhanced 
Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) across four main stages of tumor 
progression in the MMTV-PyMT mouse model (hyperplasia, adenoma/mammary 
intraepithelial neoplasia, early carcinoma and late carcinoma), during which 
malignant transition occurs. We identified a large number of differentially 
methylated cytosines (DMCs) in tumors relative to age-matched normal mammary 
glands from FVB mice. Despite similarities, the methylation differences of the 
premalignant stages were distinct from the malignant ones. Many differentially 
methylated loci were preserved from the first to the last stage throughout tumor 
progression. Genes affected by methylation gains were enriched in Polycomb 
repressive complex 2 (PRC2) targets, which may present biomarkers for early 
diagnosis and targets for treatment.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as massively parallel sequencing, 
is rapidly being incorporated into oncology practice. Interpretation of genomic 
reports and selecting treatments based on the tumor's genomic analysis becomes 
more and more complicated for the treating oncologist because of the use of 
larger panels covering dozens to hundreds of genes and the amount of rapidly 
emerging clinical/translational data. To help guide personalized treatments in 
oncology, The Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Institute for Personalized 
Cancer Therapy (IPCT) at MD Anderson Cancer Center has developed a knowledge 
base, available at https://personalizedcancertherapy.org or 
https://pct.mdanderson.org (PCT). This knowledge base provides information on 
the function of common genomic alterations and their therapeutic implications. 
Here, we describe how such genomic information can be used by health-care 
providers to identify genomically matched therapies.

PURPOSE: Although obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer, little effort has 
been made in the identification of druggable molecular alterations in 
obese-breast cancer patients. Tumors are controlled by their surrounding 
microenvironment, in which the adipose tissue is a main component. In this work, 
we intended to describe molecular alterations at a transcriptomic and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) level between obese and non-obese patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Gene expression data of 269 primary breast tumors were 
compared between normal-weight (BMI < 25, n = 130) and obese (IMC > 30, n = 139) 
patients. No significant differences were found for the global breast cancer 
population. However, within the luminal A subtype, upregulation of 81 genes was 
observed in the obese group (FC ≥ 1.4). Next, we explored the association of 
these genes with patient outcome, observing that 39 were linked with detrimental 
outcome. Their PPI map formed highly compact cluster and functional annotation 
analyses showed that cell cycle, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and 
cellular response to extracellular stimuli were the more altered functions. 
Combined analyses of genes within the described functions are correlated with 
poor outcome. PPI network analyses for each function were to search for 
druggable opportunities. We identified 16 potentially druggable candidates. 
Among them, NEK2, BIRC5, and TOP2A were also found to be amplified in breast 
cancer, suggesting that they could act as strategic players in the 
obese-deregulated transcriptome.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our in silico analysis describes molecular alterations 
of luminal A tumors and proposes a druggable PPI network in obese patients with 
potential for translation to the clinical practice.

G Protein-Coupled Receptors as Targets for Approved Drugs: How Many Targets and 
How Many Drugs?

Estimates vary regarding the number of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the 
largest family of membrane receptors that are targeted by approved drugs, and 
the number of such drugs that target GPCRs. We review current knowledge 
regarding GPCRs as drug targets by integrating data from public databases 
(ChEMBL, Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, and DrugBank) and from the Broad Institute Drug 
Repurposing Hub. To account for discrepancies among these sources, we curated a 
list of GPCRs currently targeted by approved drugs. As of November 2017, 134 
GPCRs are targets for drugs approved in the United States or European Union; 128 
GPCRs are targets for drugs listed in the Food and Drug Administration Orange 
Book. We estimate that ∼700 approved drugs target GPCRs, implying that 
approximately 35% of approved drugs target GPCRs. GPCRs and GPCR-related 
proteins, i.e., those upstream of or downstream from GPCRs, represent ∼17% of 
all protein targets for approved drugs, with GPCRs themselves accounting for 
∼12%. As such, GPCRs constitute the largest family of proteins targeted by 
approved drugs. Drugs that currently target GPCRs and GPCR-related proteins are 
primarily small molecules and peptides. Since ∼100 of the ∼360 human endo-GPCRs 
(other than olfactory, taste, and visual GPCRs) are orphan receptors (lacking 
known physiologic agonists), the number of GPCR targets, the number of 
GPCR-targeted drugs, and perhaps the types of drugs will likely increase, thus 
further expanding this GPCR repertoire and the many roles of GPCR drugs in 
therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Diagnostic workflows for glioblastoma (GBM) patients increasingly 
include DNA sequencing-based analysis of a single tumor site following biopsy or 
resection. We hypothesized that sequencing of multiple sectors within a given 
tumor would provide a more comprehensive representation of the molecular 
landscape and potentially inform therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: Ten newly diagnosed, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) wildtype GBM 
tumor samples were obtained from 2 (n = 9) or 4 (n = 1) spatially distinct tumor 
regions. Tumor and matched blood DNA samples underwent whole-exome sequencing.
RESULTS: Across all 10 tumors, 51% of mutations were clonal and 3% were 
subclonal and shared in different sectors, whereas 46% of mutations were 
subclonal and private. Two of the 10 tumors exhibited a regional hypermutator 
state despite being treatment naïve, and remarkably, the high mutational load 
was predominantly limited to one sector in each tumor. Among the canonical 
cancer-associated genes, only telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter 
mutations were observed in the founding clone in all tumors. Reconstruction of 
the clonal architecture in different sectors revealed regionally divergent 
evolution, and integration of data from 2 sectors increased the resolution of 
inferred clonal architecture in a given tumor. Predicted therapeutic mutations 
differed in presence and frequency between tumor regions. Similarly, different 
sectors exhibited significant divergence in the predicted neoantigen landscape.
CONCLUSIONS: The substantial spatial heterogeneity observed in different GBM 
tumor sectors, especially in spatially restricted hypermutator cases, raises 
important caveats to our current dependence on single-sector molecular 
information to guide either targeted or immune-based treatments.

Cancer genome sequencing has shown that driver genes can often be distinguished 
not only by the elevated mutation frequency but also by specific nucleotide 
positions that accumulate changes at a high rate. However, properties associated 
with a residue's potential to drive tumorigenesis when mutated have not yet been 
systematically investigated. Here, using a novel methodological approach, we 
identify and characterize a compendium of 180 hotspot residues within 160 human 
proteins which occur with a significant frequency and are likely to have 
functionally relevant impact. We find that such mutations (i) are more prominent 
in proteins that can exist in the on and off state, (ii) reflect the identity of 
a tumor of origin, and (iii) often localize within interfaces which mediate 
interactions with other proteins or ligands. Following, we further examine 
structural data for human protein complexes and identify a number of additional 
protein interfaces that accumulate cancer mutations at a high rate. Jointly, 
these analyses suggest that disruption and dysregulation of protein interactions 
can be instrumental in switching functions of cancer proteins and activating 
downstream changes.

Due to synergistic effects, combinatorial drugs are widely used for treating 
complex diseases. However, combining drugs and making them synergetic remains a 
challenge. Genetic disease genes are considered a promising source of drug 
targets with important implications for navigating the drug space. Most diseases 
are not caused by a single pathogenic factor, but by multiple disease genes, in 
particular, interacting disease genes. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that 
targeting epistatic disease genes may enhance the therapeutic effects of 
combinatorial drugs. In this study, synthetic lethality gene pairs of tumors, 
similar to epistatic disease genes, were first targeted by combinatorial drugs, 
resulting in the enrichment of the combinatorial drugs with cancer treatment, 
which verified our hypothesis. Then, conventional epistasis detection software 
was used to identify epistatic disease genes from the genome wide association 
studies (GWAS) dataset. Furthermore, combinatorial drugs were predicted by 
targeting these epistatic disease genes, and five combinations were proven to 
have synergistic anti-cancer effects on MCF-7 cells through cell cytotoxicity 
assay. Combined with the three-dimensional (3D) genome-based method, the 
epistatic disease genes were filtered and were more closely related to disease. 
By targeting the filtered gene pairs, the efficiency of combinatorial drug 
discovery has been further improved.

To identify novel targets for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy, we performed 
genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening using AML cell lines, followed by a second 
screen in vivo. Here, we show that the mRNA decapping enzyme scavenger (DCPS) 
gene is essential for AML cell survival. The DCPS enzyme interacted with 
components of pre-mRNA metabolic pathways, including spliceosomes, as revealed 
by mass spectrometry. RG3039, a DCPS inhibitor originally developed to treat 
spinal muscular atrophy, exhibited anti-leukemic activity via inducing pre-mRNA 
mis-splicing. Humans harboring germline biallelic DCPS loss-of-function 
mutations do not exhibit aberrant hematologic phenotypes, indicating that DCPS 
is dispensable for human hematopoiesis. Our findings shed light on a pre-mRNA 
metabolic pathway and identify DCPS as a target for AML therapy.

The diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC) is a subtype of gastric cancer with the 
worst prognosis and few treatment options. Here we present a dataset from 84 DGC 
patients, composed of a proteome of 11,340 gene products and mutation 
information of 274 cancer driver genes covering paired tumor and nearby tissue. 
DGC can be classified into three subtypes (PX1-3) based on the altered proteome 
alone. PX1 and PX2 exhibit dysregulation in the cell cycle and PX2 features 
an additional EMT process; PX3 is enriched in immune response proteins, has the 
worst survival, and is insensitive to chemotherapy. Data analysis revealed four 
major vulnerabilities in DGC that may be targeted for treatment, and allowed the 
nomination of potential immunotherapy targets for DGC patients, particularly for 
those in PX3. This dataset provides a rich resource for information and 
knowledge mining toward altered signaling pathways in DGC and demonstrates the 
benefit of proteomic analysis in cancer molecular subtyping.

Genetically engineered mouse models of cancer can be used to filter genome-wide 
expression datasets generated from human tumours and to identify gene expression 
alterations that are functionally important to cancer development and 
progression. In this study, we have generated RNAseq data from tumours arising 
in two established mouse models of prostate cancer, PB-Cre/PtenloxP/loxP and 
p53loxP/loxPRbloxP/loxP, and integrated this with published human prostate 
cancer expression data to pinpoint cancer-associated gene expression changes 
that are conserved between the two species. To identify potential therapeutic 
targets, we then filtered this information for genes that are either known or 
predicted to be druggable. Using this approach, we revealed a functional role 
for the kinase MELK as a driver and potential therapeutic target in prostate 
cancer. We found that MELK expression was required for cell survival, affected 
the expression of genes associated with prostate cancer progression and was 
associated with biochemical recurrence.

Forty percent of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) show 
resistant disease to standard chemotherapy (CHOP) in combination with the 
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (R). Although many new anti-cancer drugs 
were developed in the last years, it is unclear which of these drugs can be 
safely combined to improve standard therapy without antagonizing anti-CD20 
efficacy. In this study, we aimed to identify rituximab compatible drug-target 
combinations for DLBCL. For this, we collected gene expression profiles of 1,804 
DLBCL patient samples. Subsequently, we performed a guilt-by-association 
analysis with MS4A1 (CD20) and prioritized the 500 top-ranked CD20-associated 
gene probes for drug-target interactions. This analysis showed the well-known 
genes involved in DLBCL pathobiology, but also revealed several genes that are 
relatively unknown in DLBCL, such as WEE1 and PARP1. To demonstrate potential 
clinical relevance of these targets, we confirmed high protein expression of 
WEE1 and PARP1 in patient samples. Using clinically approved WEE1 and PARP1 
inhibiting drugs in combination with rituximab, we demonstrated significantly 
improved DLBCL cell killing, also in rituximab-insensitive cell lines. In 
conclusion, as exemplified by WEE1 and PARP1, our CD20-based genome-wide 
analysis can be used as an approach to identify biological relevant drug-targets 
that are rituximab compatible and may be implemented in phase 1/2 clinical 
trials to improve DLBCL treatment.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over two hundred 
chromosomal loci that modulate risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). The genes 
affected by variants at these loci are largely unknown and an untapped resource 
to improve our understanding of CAD pathophysiology and identify potential 
therapeutic targets. Here, we prioritized 68 genes as the most likely causal 
genes at genome-wide significant loci identified by GWAS of CAD and examined 
their regulatory roles in 286 metabolic and vascular tissue gene-protein 
sub-networks ("modules"). The modules and genes within were scored for CAD 
druggability potential. The scoring enriched for targets of cardiometabolic 
drugs currently in clinical use and in-depth analysis of the top-scoring modules 
validated established and revealed novel target tissues, biological processes, 
and druggable targets. This study provides an unprecedented resource of 
tissue-defined gene-protein interactions directly affected by genetic variance 
in CAD risk loci.

Treatment of mice harboring PTEN-P2 tumors in the prostate or on prostate tissue 
in vivo with 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, also known as plumbagin, 
results in tumor regression in castrated mice, but not in intact mice. This 
suggested that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production in the testes may prevent 
cell death due to plumbagin treatment, but the underlying mechanism is not 
understood. We performed RNA-seq analysis on cells treated with combinations of 
plumbagin and DHT, and analyzed differential gene expression, to gain insight 
into the interactions between androgen and plumbgin. DHT and plumbagin synergize 
to alter the expression of many genes that are not differentially regulated by 
either single agent when used alone. These experiments revealed that, for many 
genes, increases in mRNAs caused by DHT are sharply down-regulated by plumbagin, 
and that many transcripts change in response to plumbagin in a DHT-dependent 
manner. This suggests that androgen receptor mediates some of the effects of 
plumbagin on gene expression.

Lipid metabolism is drastically dysregulated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
and impacts prognosis of patients. Animal models recapitulate alterations in the 
energy metabolism, including hypermetabolism and severe loss of adipose tissue. 
To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression in 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we have performed RNA-sequencing and lipidomic 
profiling in spinal cord of symptomatic SOD1G86R mice. Spinal transcriptome of 
SOD1G86R mice was characterized by differential expression of genes related to 
immune system, extracellular exosome, and lysosome. Hypothesis-driven 
identification of metabolites showed that lipids, including 
sphingomyelin(d18:0/26:1), ceramide(d18:1/22:0), and 
phosphatidylcholine(o-22:1/20:4) showed profound altered levels. A correlation 
between disease severity and gene expression or metabolite levels was found for 
sphingosine, ceramide(d18:1/26:0), Sgpp2, Sphk1, and Ugt8a. Joint-analysis 
revealed a significant enrichment of glycosphingolipid metabolism in SOD1G86R 
mice, due to the down-regulation of ceramide, glucosylceramide, and 
lactosylceramide and the overexpression of genes involved in their recycling in 
the lysosome. A drug-gene interaction database was interrogated to identify 
potential drugs able to modulate the dysregulated genes from the signaling 
pathway. Our results suggest that complex lipids are pivotally changed during 
the first phase of motor symptoms in an animal model of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis.

Genomic sequencing has driven precision-based oncology therapy; however, the 
genetic drivers of many malignancies remain unknown or non-targetable, so 
alternative approaches to the identification of therapeutic leads are necessary. 
Ependymomas are chemotherapy-resistant brain tumours, which, despite genomic 
sequencing, lack effective molecular targets. Intracranial ependymomas are 
segregated on the basis of anatomical location (supratentorial region or 
posterior fossa) and further divided into distinct molecular subgroups that 
reflect differences in the age of onset, gender predominance and response to 
therapy. The most common and aggressive subgroup, posterior fossa ependymoma 
group A (PF-EPN-A), occurs in young children and appears to lack recurrent 
somatic mutations. Conversely, posterior fossa ependymoma group B (PF-EPN-B) 
tumours display frequent large-scale copy number gains and losses but have 
favourable clinical outcomes. More than 70% of supratentorial ependymomas are 
defined by highly recurrent gene fusions in the NF-κB subunit gene RELA 
(ST-EPN-RELA), and a smaller number involve fusion of the gene encoding the 
transcriptional activator YAP1 (ST-EPN-YAP1). Subependymomas, a distinct 
histologic variant, can also be found within the supratetorial and posterior 
fossa compartments, and account for the majority of tumours in the molecular 
subgroups ST-EPN-SE and PF-EPN-SE. Here we describe mapping of active chromatin 
landscapes in 42 primary ependymomas in two non-overlapping primary ependymoma 
cohorts, with the goal of identifying essential super-enhancer-associated genes 
on which tumour cells depend. Enhancer regions revealed putative oncogenes, 
molecular targets and pathways; inhibition of these targets with small molecule 
inhibitors or short hairpin RNA diminished the proliferation of patient-derived 
neurospheres and increased survival in mouse models of ependymomas. Through 
profiling of transcriptional enhancers, our study provides a framework for 
target and drug discovery in other cancers that lack known genetic drivers and 
are therefore difficult to treat.

The drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb, www.dgidb.org) consolidates, 
organizes and presents drug-gene interactions and gene druggability information 
from papers, databases and web resources. DGIdb normalizes content from 30 
disparate sources and allows for user-friendly advanced browsing, searching and 
filtering for ease of access through an intuitive web user interface, 
application programming interface (API) and public cloud-based server image. 
DGIdb v3.0 represents a major update of the database. Nine of the previously 
included 24 sources were updated. Six new resources were added, bringing the 
total number of sources to 30. These updates and additions of sources have 
cumulatively resulted in 56 309 interaction claims. This has also substantially 
expanded the comprehensive catalogue of druggable genes and anti-neoplastic 
drug-gene interactions included in the DGIdb. Along with these content updates, 
v3.0 has received a major overhaul of its codebase, including an updated user 
interface, preset interaction search filters, consolidation of interaction 
information into interaction groups, greatly improved search response times and 
upgrading the underlying web application framework. In addition, the expanded 
API features new endpoints which allow users to extract more detailed 
information about queried drugs, genes and drug-gene interactions, including 
listings of PubMed IDs, interaction type and other interaction metadata.

In spite of a growing body of research and data, human ageing remains a poorly 
understood process. Over 10 years ago we developed the Human Ageing Genomic 
Resources (HAGR), a collection of databases and tools for studying the biology 
and genetics of ageing. Here, we present HAGR's main functionalities, 
highlighting new additions and improvements. HAGR consists of six core 
databases: (i) the GenAge database of ageing-related genes, in turn composed of 
a dataset of >300 human ageing-related genes and a dataset with >2000 genes 
associated with ageing or longevity in model organisms; (ii) the AnAge database 
of animal ageing and longevity, featuring >4000 species; (iii) the GenDR 
database with >200 genes associated with the life-extending effects of dietary 
restriction; (iv) the LongevityMap database of human genetic association studies 
of longevity with >500 entries; (v) the DrugAge database with >400 ageing or 
longevity-associated drugs or compounds; (vi) the CellAge database with >200 
genes associated with cell senescence. All our databases are manually curated by 
experts and regularly updated to ensure a high quality data. Cross-links across 
our databases and to external resources help researchers locate and integrate 
relevant information. HAGR is freely available online 
(http://genomics.senescence.info/).

A growing number of genomic tools and databases were developed to facilitate the 
interpretation of genomic variants, particularly in coding regions. However, 
these tools are separately available in different online websites or databases, 
making it challenging for general clinicians, geneticists and biologists to 
obtain the first-hand information regarding some particular variants and genes 
of interest. Starting with coding regions and splice sties, we artificially 
generated all possible single nucleotide variants (n = 110 154 363) and 
cataloged all reported insertion and deletions (n = 1 223 370). We then 
annotated these variants with respect to functional consequences from more than 
60 genomic data sources to develop a database, named VarCards 
(http://varcards.biols.ac.cn/), by which users can conveniently search, browse 
and annotate the variant- and gene-level implications of given variants, 
including the following information: (i) functional effects; (ii) functional 
consequences through different in silico algorithms; (iii) allele frequencies in 
different populations; (iv) disease- and phenotype-related knowledge; (v) 
general meaningful gene-level information; and (vi) drug-gene interactions. As a 
case study, we successfully employed VarCards in interpretation of de novo 
mutations in autism spectrum disorders. In conclusion, VarCards provides an 
intuitive interface of necessary information for researchers to prioritize 
candidate variations and genes.

PURPOSE: Data standards and interoperability are critical for improving care for 
patients with cancer. Recent efforts by ASCO include the Data Standards and 
Interoperability Summit in 2016, which led to the Omics and Precision Oncology 
and Advancing Interoperability workshops. To facilitate improved patient care, 
several recommendations for data sharing and standardization were made to the 
community.
METHODS: To address these recommendations, we developed SMART Cancer Navigator, 
a Web application that uses application programming interfaces to gather 
clinical and genomic data from 11 public knowledge bases ranging from basic to 
clinical content coverage; three (CIViC, ClinVar, and OncoKB) explicitly linked 
genomic variants to clinical factors such as prognosis and treatment selection. 
We illustrated the utility of this application by selecting one of the monthly 
case studies presented by the ASCO University Molecular Oncology Tumor Board: 
Ovarian Cancer (BRCA Mutation). We also performed analyses on information from 
the three clinico-genomic knowledge bases to corroborate previous work and 
illustrate the state of data sharing among publicly available resources.
RESULTS: SMART Cancer Navigator aggregates and contextualizes data from 11 
different knowledge bases and stores user queries in a lightweight Web 
application that can link into Fast Healthcare Interoperability 
Resources-enabled electronic health records. Potentially relevant clinical 
trials and/or approved treatments were identified for three mutations found in a 
hypothetical patient with advanced ovarian cancer. A comparison of the three 
clinico-genomic knowledge bases indicated substantial differences in coverage at 
the gene and variant levels.
CONCLUSION: SMART Cancer Navigator has immediate relevance to practicing 
oncologists and others. Additional knowledge bases can be added without undue 
effort. As a first step toward utility, we generalized and disseminated the 
resulting implementation (https://smart-cancer-navigator.github.io) and data 
sets.

BACKGROUND: Prediction of drug-disease interactions is promising for either drug 
repositioning or disease treatment fields. The discovery of novel drug-disease 
interactions, on one hand can help to find novel indictions for the approved 
drugs; on the other hand can provide new therapeutic approaches for the 
diseases. Recently, computational methods for finding drug-disease interactions 
have attracted lots of attention because of their far more higher efficiency and 
lower cost than the traditional wet experiment methods. However, they still face 
several challenges, such as the organization of the heterogeneous data, the 
performance of the model, and so on.
METHODS: In this work, we present to hierarchically integrate the heterogeneous 
data into three layers. The drug-drug and disease-disease similarities are first 
calculated separately in each layer, and then the similarities from three layers 
are linearly fused into comprehensive drug similarities and disease 
similarities, which can then be used to measure the similarities between two 
drug-disease pairs. We construct a novel weighted drug-disease pair network, 
where a node is a drug-disease pair with known or unknown treatment relation, an 
edge represents the node-node relation which is weighted with the similarity 
score between two pairs. Now that similar drug-disease pairs are supposed to 
show similar treatment patterns, we can find the optimal graph cut of the 
network. The drug-disease pair with unknown relation can then be considered to 
have similar treatment relation with that within the same cut. Therefore, we 
develop a semi-supervised graph cut algorithm, SSGC, to find the optimal graph 
cut, based on which we can identify the potential drug-disease treatment 
interactions.
RESULTS: By comparing with three representative network-based methods, SSGC 
achieves the highest performances, in terms of both AUC score and the 
identification rates of true drug-disease pairs. The experiments with different 
integration strategies also demonstrate that considering several sources of data 
can improve the performances of the predictors. Further case studies on four 
diseases, the top-ranked drug-disease associations have been confirmed by KEGG, 
CTD database and the literature, illustrating the usefulness of SSGC.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed comprehensive similarity scores from multi-views and 
multiple layers and the graph-cut based algorithm can greatly improve the 
prediction performances of drug-disease associations.

We report a template-based method, LT-scanner, which scans the human proteome 
using protein structural alignment to identify proteins that are likely to bind 
ligands that are present in experimentally determined complexes. A scoring 
function that rapidly accounts for binding site similarities between the 
template and the proteins being scanned is a crucial feature of the method. The 
overall approach is first tested based on its ability to predict the residues on 
the surface of a protein that are likely to bind small-molecule ligands. The 
algorithm that we present, LBias, is shown to compare very favorably to existing 
algorithms for binding site residue prediction. LT-scanner's performance is 
evaluated based on its ability to identify known targets of Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and it too proves to be highly effective. 
The specificity of the scoring function that we use is demonstrated by the 
ability of LT-scanner to identify the known targets of FDA-approved kinase 
inhibitors based on templates involving other kinases. Combining sequence with 
structural information further improves LT-scanner performance. The approach we 
describe is extendable to the more general problem of identifying binding 
partners of known ligands even if they do not appear in a structurally 
determined complex, although this will require the integration of methods that 
combine protein structure and chemical compound databases.

Large, multidimensional cancer datasets provide a resource that can be mined to 
identify candidate therapeutic targets for specific subgroups of tumors. Here, 
we analyzed human breast cancer data to identify transcriptional programs 
associated with tumors bearing specific genetic driver alterations. Using an 
unbiased approach, we identified thousands of genes whose expression was 
enriched in tumors with specific genetic alterations. However, expression of the 
vast majority of these genes was not enriched if associations were analyzed 
within individual breast tumor molecular subtypes, across multiple tumor types, 
or after gene expression was normalized to account for differences in 
proliferation or tumor lineage. Together with linear modeling results, these 
findings suggest that most transcriptional programs associated with specific 
genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors are highly 
context-dependent and are predominantly linked to differences in proliferation 
programs between distinct breast cancer subtypes. We demonstrate that such 
proliferation-dependent gene expression dominates tumor transcriptional programs 
relative to matched normal tissues. However, we also identified a relatively 
small group of cancer-associated genes that are both proliferation- and 
lineage-independent. A subset of these genes are attractive candidate targets 
for combination therapy because they are essential in breast cancer cell lines, 
druggable, enriched in stem-like breast cancer cells, and resistant to 
chemotherapy-induced down-regulation.

Driver mutation provides fitness advantage to cancer cells, the accumulation of 
which increases the fitness of cancer cells and accelerates cancer progression. 
This work seeks to extract patterns accumulated by driver genes ("fitness 
relationships") in tumorigenesis. We introduce a network-based method for 
extracting the fitness relationships of driver genes by modeling the network 
properties of the "fitness" of cancer cells. Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and 
skin cutaneous malignant melanoma (SKCM) are employed as case studies. 
Consistent results derived from different background networks suggest the 
reliability of the identified fitness relationships. Additionally co-occurrence 
analysis and pathway analysis reveal the functional significance of the fitness 
relationships with signaling transduction. In addition, a subset of driver genes 
called the "fitness core" is recognized for each case. Further analyses indicate 
the functional importance of the fitness core in carcinogenesis, and provide 
potential therapeutic opportunities in medicinal intervention. Fitness 
relationships characterize the functional continuity among driver genes in 
carcinogenesis, and suggest new insights in understanding the oncogenic 
mechanisms of cancers, as well as providing guiding information for medicinal 
intervention.

The development of new drugs has become challenging as the necessary investments 
in time and money have increased while drug approval rates have decreased. A 
potential solution to this problem is drug repositioning which aims to use 
existing drugs to treat conditions for which they were not originally intended. 
One approach that may enhance the likelihood of success is to reposition drugs 
against a target that has a genetic basis. The multitude of genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) conducted in recent years represents a large 
potential pool of novel targets for drug repositioning. Although 
trait-associated variants identified from GWAS still need to be causally linked 
to a target gene, recently developed functional genomic techniques, databases, 
and workflows are helping to remove this bottleneck. The pre-clinical validation 
of repositioning against these targets also needs to be carefully performed to 
ensure that findings are not confounded by off-target effects or limitations of 
the techniques used. Nevertheless, the approaches described in this review have 
the potential to provide a faster, cheaper and more certain route to clinical 
approval.

Diseases affecting skeletal muscle exhibit considerable heterogeneity in 
intensity, etiology, phenotypic manifestation and gene expression. Systems 
biology approaches using network theory, allows for a holistic understanding of 
functional similarities amongst diseases. Here we propose a co-expression based, 
network theoretic approach to extract functional similarities from 20 
heterogeneous diseases comprising of dystrophinopathies, inflammatory 
myopathies, neuromuscular, and muscle metabolic diseases. Utilizing this 
framework we identified seven closely associated disease clusters with 20 
disease pairs exhibiting significant correlation (p < 0.05). Mapping the 
diseases onto a human protein-protein interaction network enabled the inference 
of a common program of regulation underlying more than half the muscle diseases 
considered here and referred to as the "protein signature." Enrichment analysis 
of 17 protein modules identified as part of this signature revealed a 
statistically non-random dysregulation of muscle bioenergetic pathways and 
calcium homeostasis. Further, analysis of mechanistic similarities of less 
explored significant disease associations [such as between amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) and cerebral palsy (CP)] using a proposed "functional module" 
framework revealed adaptation of the calcium signaling machinery. Integrating 
drug-gene information into the quantitative framework highlighted the presence 
of therapeutic opportunities through drug repurposing for diseases affecting the 
skeletal muscle.

A core tenet of precision oncology is the rational choice of drugs to interact 
with patient-specific biological targets of interest, but it is currently 
difficult for researchers to obtain consistent and well-supported target 
information for pharmaceutical drugs. We review current drug-target interaction 
resources and critically assess how supporting evidence is handled. We introduce 
the concept of a unified Cancer Targetome to aggregate drug-target interactions 
in an evidence-based framework. We discuss current unmet needs and the 
implications for evidence-based clinical omics. The focus of this review is 
precision oncology but the discussion is highly relevant to targeted therapies 
in any area.

Myxofibrosarcomas are morphologically heterogeneous soft tissue sarcomas lacking 
a specific immunohistochemical expression profile and recurrent genetic changes. 
The study was designed to gain further insights into the molecular landscape of 
myxofibrosarcomas by targeted re-sequencing of known cancer driver hotspot 
mutations and the analysis of genomewide somatic copy number alterations. A 
well-defined group of myxofibrosarcomas, including myxofibrosarcomas G1 (n=6), 
myxofibrosarcomas G3 (n=7), myxofibrosarcomas with morphologically heterogeneous 
and independently selectable G1 and G3 areas within a tumor (n=8), and 
myxofibrosarcomas G3 with subsequent tumor recurrence (n=1) or metastatic 
disease (n=3) were evaluated. Mutational analysis demonstrated mutations in 
TP53, PTEN, FGFR3, CDKN2A, and RB1. TP53 mutations were seen in 11 (44%) of 
patients and detected in myxofibrosarcomas G1, G3, with heterogeneous morphology 
and G3 with subsequent metastases in 1 patient (16%), 3 patients (42%), 2 
patients (62.5%), and 3 patients (75%), respectively. Additional mutations were 
detected in 2 patients, intratumoral mutational heterogeneity in 1 patient. We 
observed a variety of copy number alterations typical for myxofibrosarcomas, 
with higher numbers in G3 compared with G1 myxofibrosarcomas. Cluster analysis 
revealed distinctive features especially in metastatic and recurrent disease. 
Focal alterations affected CDKN2A, CCND1, CCNE1, EGFR, EPHA3, EPHB1, FGFR1, JUN, 
NF1, RB1, RET, TP53, and additional novel amplifications in CCNE1, KIT, EGFR, 
RET, BRAF, NTRK2 were seen in G3 compared with the G1 tumor areas. The total 
number of focal events in G1 versus G3 tumors differed significantly (P=0.0014). 
TRIO and RICTOR co-amplification was seen in 8 (44%) G3 and 1 (10%) G1 
myxofibrosarcomas and RICTOR amplification alone in 4 (40%) G1 
myxofibrosarcomas. TRIO amplification was significantly (P=0.0218) higher in G3 
myxofibrosarcomas indicating a late genetic event. These findings support the 
use of expanded molecular profiling in myxofibrosarcomas to detect drug-able 
targets to allow patients to participate in basket trials.

Male pattern baldness (MPB) or androgenetic alopecia is one of the most common 
conditions affecting men, reaching a prevalence of ~50% by the age of 50; 
however, the known genes explain little of the heritability. Here, we present 
the results of a genome-wide association study including more than 70,000 men, 
identifying 71 independently replicated loci, of which 30 are novel. These loci 
explain 38% of the risk, suggesting that MPB is less genetically complex than 
other complex traits. We show that many of these loci contain genes that are 
relevant to the pathology and highlight pathways and functions underlying 
baldness. Finally, despite only showing genome-wide genetic correlation with 
height, pathway-specific genetic correlations are significant for traits 
including lifespan and cancer. Our study not only greatly increases the number 
of MPB loci, illuminating the genetic architecture, but also provides a new 
approach to disentangling the shared biological pathways underlying complex 
diseases.

There remains a large discrepancy between the known genetic contributions to 
cancer and that which can be explained by genomic variants, both inherited and 
somatic. Recently, understudied repetitive DNA regions called microsatellites 
have been identified as genetic risk markers for a number of diseases including 
various cancers (breast, ovarian and brain). In this study, we demonstrate an 
integrated process for identifying and further evaluating microsatellite-based 
risk markers for lung cancer using data from the cancer genome atlas and the 
1000 genomes project. Comparing whole-exome germline sequencing data from 488 
TCGA lung cancer samples to germline exome data from 390 control samples from 
the 1000 genomes project, we identified 119 potentially informative 
microsatellite loci. These loci were found to be able to distinguish between 
cancer and control samples with sensitivity and specificity ratios over 0.8. 
Then these loci, supplemented with additional loci from other cancers and 
controls, were evaluated using a target enrichment kit and sample-multiplexed 
nextgen sequencing. Thirteen of the 119 risk markers were found to be 
informative in a well powered study (>0.99 for a 0.95 confidence interval) using 
high-depth (579x±315) nextgen sequencing of 30 lung cancer and 89 control 
samples, resulting in sensitivity and specificity ratios of 0.90 and 0.94, 
respectively. When 8 loci harvested from the bioinformatic analysis of other 
cancers are added to the classifier, then the sensitivity and specificity rise 
to 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. Analysis of the genes harboring these loci 
revealed two genes (ARID1B and REL) and two significantly enriched pathways 
(chromatin organization and cellular stress response) suggesting that the 
process of lung carcinogenesis is linked to chromatin remodeling, inflammation, 
and tumor microenvironment restructuring. We illustrate that high-depth 
sequencing enables a high-precision microsatellite-based risk classifier 
analysis approach. This microsatellite-based platform confirms the potential to 
create clinically actionable diagnostics for lung cancer.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a group of cancers whose heterogeneity 
and shortage of effective drug therapies has prompted efforts to divide these 
cancers into molecular subtypes. Our computational platform, entitled 
GenEx-TNBC, applies concepts in systems biology and polypharmacology to 
prioritize thousands of approved and experimental drugs for therapeutic 
potential against each molecular subtype of TNBC. Using patient-based and cell 
line-based gene expression data, we constructed networks to describe the 
biological perturbation associated with each TNBC subtype at multiple levels of 
biological action. These networks were analyzed for statistical coincidence with 
drug action networks stemming from known drug-protein targets, while accounting 
for the direction of disease modulation for coinciding entities. GenEx-TNBC 
successfully designated drugs, and drug classes, that were previously shown to 
be broadly effective or subtype-specific against TNBC, as well as novel agents. 
We further performed biological validation of the platform by testing the 
relative sensitivities of three cell lines, representing three distinct TNBC 
subtypes, to several small molecules according to the degree of predicted 
biological coincidence with each subtype. GenEx-TNBC is the first computational 
platform to associate drugs to diseases based on inverse relationships with 
multi-scale disease mechanisms mapped from global gene expression of a disease. 
This method may be useful for directing current efforts in preclinical drug 
development surrounding TNBC, and may offer insights into the targetable 
mechanisms of each TNBC subtype.

High-throughput genomic and molecular profiling of tumors is emerging as an 
important clinical approach. Molecular profiling is increasingly being used to 
guide cancer patient care, especially in advanced and incurable cancers. 
However, navigating the scientific literature to make evidence-based clinical 
decisions based on molecular profiling results is overwhelming for many oncology 
clinicians and researchers. The Personalized Cancer Therapy website 
(www.personalizedcancertherapy.org) was created to provide an online resource 
for clinicians and researchers to facilitate navigation of available data. 
Specifically, this resource can be used to help identify potential therapy 
options for patients harboring oncogenic genomic alterations. Herein, we 
describe how content on www.personalizedcancertherapy.org is generated and 
maintained. We end with case scenarios to illustrate the clinical utility of the 
website. The goal of this publicly available resource is to provide easily 
accessible information to a broad oncology audience, as this may help ease the 
information retrieval burden facing participants in the precision oncology 
field. Cancer Res; 77(21); e123-6. ©2017 AACR.

Hypertension (HT) is a complex systemic disease involving transcriptional 
changes in multiple organs. Here we systematically investigate the pan-tissue 
transcriptional and genetic landscape of HT spanning dozens of tissues in 
hundreds of individuals. We find that in several tissues, previously identified 
HT-linked genes are dysregulated and the gene expression profile is predictive 
of HT. Importantly, many expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) SNPs 
associated with the population variance of the dysregulated genes are linked 
with blood pressure in an independent genome-wide association study, suggesting 
that the functional effect of HT-associated SNPs may be mediated through 
tissue-specific transcriptional dysregulation. Analyses of pan-tissue 
transcriptional dysregulation profile, as well as eQTL SNPs underlying the 
dysregulated genes, reveals substantial heterogeneity among the HT patients, 
revealing two broad groupings - a Diffused group where several tissues exhibit 
HT-associated molecular alterations and a Localized group where such alterations 
are localized to very few tissues. These two patient subgroups differ in several 
clinical phenotypes including respiratory, cerebrovascular, diabetes, and heart 
disease. These findings suggest that the Diffused and Localized subgroups may be 
driven by different molecular mechanisms and have different genetic 
underpinning.

Using successful genome-wide association results in psychiatry for drug 
repurposing is an ongoing challenge. Databases collecting drug targets and gene 
annotations are growing and can be harnessed to shed a new light on psychiatric 
disorders. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from 
the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) Schizophrenia working group to build a 
drug repositioning model for schizophrenia. As sample size increases, 
schizophrenia GWAS results show increasing enrichment for known antipsychotic 
drugs, selective calcium channel blockers, and antiepileptics. Each of these 
therapeutical classes targets different gene subnetworks. We identify 123 
Bonferroni-significant druggable genes outside the MHC, and 128 FDR-significant 
biological pathways related to neurons, synapses, genic intolerance, membrane 
transport, epilepsy, and mental disorders. These results suggest that, in 
schizophrenia, current well-powered GWAS results can reliably detect known 
schizophrenia drugs and thus may hold considerable potential for the 
identification of new therapeutic leads. Moreover, antiepileptics and calcium 
channel blockers may provide repurposing opportunities. This study also reveals 
significant pathways in schizophrenia that were not identified previously, and 
provides a workflow for pathway analysis and drug repurposing using GWAS 
results.

Precision genomic oncology-applying high throughput sequencing (HTS) at the 
point-of-care to inform clinical decisions-is a developing precision medicine 
paradigm that is seeing increasing adoption. Simultaneously, new developments in 
targeted agents and immunotherapy, when informed by rich genomic 
characterization, offer potential benefit to a growing subset of patients. 
Multiple previous studies have commented on methods for identifying both 
germline and somatic variants. However, interpreting individual variants remains 
a significant challenge, relying in large part on the integration of observed 
variants with biological knowledge. A number of data and software resources have 
been developed to assist in interpreting observed variants, determining their 
potential clinical actionability, and augmenting them with ancillary information 
that can inform clinical decisions and even generate new hypotheses for 
exploration in the laboratory. Here, we review available variant catalogs, 
variant and functional annotation software and tools, and databases of 
clinically actionable variants that can be used in an ad hoc approach with 
research samples or incorporated into a data platform for interpreting and 
formally reporting clinical results.

Neurons are often classified by their morphological and molecular properties. 
The online knowledge base Hippocampome.org primarily defines neuron types from 
the rodent hippocampal formation based on their main neurotransmitter (glutamate 
or GABA) and the spatial distributions of their axons and dendrites. For each 
neuron type, this open-access resource reports any and all published information 
regarding the presence or absence of known molecular markers, including 
calcium-binding proteins, neuropeptides, receptors, channels, transcription 
factors, and other molecules of biomedical relevance. The resulting chemical 
profile is relatively sparse: even for the best studied neuron types, the 
expression or lack thereof of fewer than 70 molecules has been firmly 
established to date. The mouse genome-wide in situ hybridization mapping of the 
Allen Brain Atlas provides a wealth of data that, when appropriately analyzed, 
can substantially augment the molecular marker knowledge in Hippocampome.org. 
Here we focus on the principal cell layers of dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, CA2, and 
CA1, which together contain approximately 90% of hippocampal neurons. These four 
anatomical parcels are densely packed with somata of mostly excitatory 
projection neurons. Thus, gene expression data for those layers can be 
justifiably linked to the respective principal neuron types: granule cells in DG 
and pyramidal cells in CA3, CA2, and CA1. In order to enable consistent 
interpretation across genes and regions, we screened the whole-genome dataset 
against known molecular markers of those neuron types. The resulting threshold 
values allow over 6000 very-high confidence (>99.5%) expressed/not-expressed 
assignments, expanding the biochemical information content of Hippocampome.org 
more than five-fold. Many of these newly identified molecular markers are 
potential pharmacological targets for major neurological and psychiatric 
conditions. Furthermore, our approach yields reasonable 
expression/non-expression estimates for every single gene in each of these four 
neuron types with >90% average confidence, providing a considerably complete 
genetic characterization of hippocampal principal neurons.

BACKGROUND: Gingivo-buccal squamous cell carcinoma (GBSCC) is one of the most 
common oral cavity cancers in India with less than 50% patients surviving past 5 
years. Here, we report a whole transcriptome profile on a batch of GBSCC tumours 
with diverse tobacco usage habits. The study provides an entire landscape of 
altered expression with an emphasis on searching for targets with therapeutic 
potential.
METHODS: Whole transcriptomes of 12 GBSCC tumours and adjacent normal tissues 
were sequenced and analysed to explore differential expression of genes. 
Expression changes were further compared with those in TCGA head and neck cohort 
(n = 263) data base and validated in an independent set of 10GBSCC samples.
RESULTS: Differentially expressed genes (n = 2176) were used to cluster the 
patients based on their tobacco habits, resulting in 3 subgroups. Immune 
response was observed to be significantly aberrant, along with cell adhesion and 
lipid metabolism processes. Different modes of immune evasion were seen across 
12 tumours with up-regulation or consistent expression of CD47, unlike other 
immune evasion genes such as PDL1, FUT4, CTLA4 and BTLA which were downregulated 
in a few samples. Variation in infiltrating immune cell signatures across 
tumours also indicates heterogeneity in immune evasion strategies. A few 
actionable genes such as ITGA4, TGFB1 and PTGS1/COX1 were over expressed in most 
samples.
CONCLUSION: This study found expression deregulation of key immune evasion 
genes, such as CD47 and PDL1, and reasserts their potential as effective 
immunotherapeutic targets for GBSCC, which requires further clinical studies. 
Present findings reiterate the idea of using transcriptome profiling to guide 
precision therapeutic strategies.

Bone metastases (BoM) are a significant cause of morbidity in patients with 
estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) breast cancer; yet, characterizations 
of human specimens are limited. In this study, exome-capture RNA sequencing 
(ecRNA-seq) on aged (8-12 years), formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE), and 
decalcified cancer specimens was evaluated. Gene expression values and ecRNA-seq 
quality metrics from FFPE or decalcified tumor RNA showed minimal differences 
when compared with matched flash-frozen or nondecalcified tumors. ecRNA-seq was 
then applied on a longitudinal collection of 11 primary breast cancers and 
patient-matched synchronous or recurrent BoMs. Overtime, BoMs exhibited gene 
expression shifts to more Her2 and LumB PAM50 subtype profiles, temporally 
influenced expression evolution, recurrently dysregulated prognostic gene sets, 
and longitudinal expression alterations of clinically actionable genes, 
particularly in the CDK/Rb/E2F and FGFR signaling pathways. Taken together, this 
study demonstrates the use of ecRNA-seq on decade-old and decalcified specimens 
and defines recurrent longitudinal transcriptional remodeling events in 
estrogen-deprived breast cancers.

Prioritizing molecular alterations that act as drivers of cancer remains a 
crucial bottleneck in therapeutic development. Here we introduce HIT'nDRIVE, a 
computational method that integrates genomic and transcriptomic data to identify 
a set of patient-specific, sequence-altered genes, with sufficient collective 
influence over dysregulated transcripts. HIT'nDRIVE aims to solve the "random 
walk facility location" (RWFL) problem in a gene (or protein) interaction 
network, which differs from the standard facility location problem by its use of 
an alternative distance measure: "multihitting time," the expected length of the 
shortest random walk from any one of the set of sequence-altered genes to an 
expression-altered target gene. When applied to 2200 tumors from four major 
cancer types, HIT'nDRIVE revealed many potentially clinically actionable driver 
genes. We also demonstrated that it is possible to perform accurate phenotype 
prediction for tumor samples by only using HIT'nDRIVE-seeded driver gene modules 
from gene interaction networks. In addition, we identified a number of breast 
cancer subtype-specific driver modules that are associated with patients' 
survival outcome. Furthermore, HIT'nDRIVE, when applied to a large panel of 
pan-cancer cell lines, accurately predicted drug efficacy using the driver genes 
and their seeded gene modules. Overall, HIT'nDRIVE may help clinicians 
contextualize massive multiomics data in therapeutic decision making, enabling 
widespread implementation of precision oncology.

Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of dendritic cell 
origin that is currently poorly characterized by genetic studies. To investigate 
whether recurrent genomic alterations may underlie the biology of follicular 
dendritic cell sarcoma and to identify potential contributory regions and genes, 
molecular inversion probe array analysis was performed on 14 independent 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples. Abnormal genomic profiles were 
observed in 11 out of 14 (79%) cases. The majority showed extensive genomic 
complexity that was predominantly represented by hemizygous losses affecting 
multiple chromosomes. Alterations of chromosomal regions 1p (55%), 2p (55%), 3p 
(82%), 3q (45%), 6q (55%), 7q (73%), 8p (45%), 9p (64%), 11q (64%), 13q (91%), 
14q (82%), 15q (64%), 17p (55%), 18q (64%), and 22q (55%) were recurrent across 
the 11 samples showing abnormal genomic profiles. Many recurrent genomic 
alterations in follicular dendritic cell sarcoma overlap deletions that are 
frequently observed across human cancers, suggesting selection, or an active 
role for these alterations in follicular dendritic cell sarcoma pathogenesis. In 
support of a tumor suppressor-driven biology, homozygous deletions involving 
tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A, RB1, BIRC3, and CYLD were also observed. Neither 
recurrent gains nor amplifications were observed. This genomic characterization 
provides new information regarding follicular dendritic cell sarcoma biology 
that may improve understanding about the underlying pathophysiology, provide 
better prognostication, and identify potential therapeutic markers for this rare 
disease.

Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (coxibs) are characterized by multiple molecular 
off-target effects and increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Here, we 
systematically explored common variants of genes representing molecular targets 
of coxibs for association with CAD. Given a broad spectrum of pleiotropic 
effects of coxibs, our intention was to narrow potential mechanisms affecting 
CAD risk as we hypothesized that the affected genes may also display genomic 
signals of coronary disease risk. A Drug Gene Interaction Database search 
identified 47 gene products to be affected by coxibs. We traced association 
signals in 200-kb regions surrounding these genes in 84,813 CAD cases and 
202,543 controls. Based on a threshold of 1 × 10-5 (Bonferroni correction for 
3131 haplotype blocks), four gene loci yielded significant associations. The 
lead SNPs were rs7270354 (MMP9), rs4888383 (BCAR1), rs6905288 (VEGFA1), and 
rs556321 (CACNA1E). By additional genotyping, rs7270354 at MMP9 and rs4888383 at 
BCAR1 also reached the established GWAS threshold for genome-wide significance. 
The findings demonstrate overlap of genes affected by coxibs and those mediating 
CAD risk and points to further mechanisms, which are potentially responsible for 
coxib-associated CAD risk. The novel approach furthermore suggests that genetic 
studies may be useful to explore the clinical relevance of off-target drug 
effects.

Glatiramer acetate is used therapeutically in multiple sclerosis but also known 
for adverse effects including elevated coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The 
mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular side effects of the medication are 
unclear. Here, we made use of the chromosomal variation in the genes that are 
known to be affected by glatiramer treatment. Focusing on genes and gene 
products reported by drug-gene interaction database to interact with glatiramer 
acetate we explored a large meta-analysis on CAD genome-wide association studies 
aiming firstly, to investigate whether variants in these genes also affect 
cardiovascular risk and secondly, to identify new CAD risk genes. We traced 
association signals in a 200-kb region around genomic positions of genes 
interacting with glatiramer in up to 60 801 CAD cases and 123 504 controls. We 
validated the identified association in additional 21 934 CAD cases and 76 087 
controls. We identified three new CAD risk alleles within the TGFB1 region on 
chromosome 19 that independently affect CAD risk. The lead SNP rs12459996 was 
genome-wide significantly associated with CAD in the extended meta-analysis 
(odds ratio 1.09, p = 1.58×10-12). The other two SNPs at the locus were not in 
linkage disequilibrium with the lead SNP and by a conditional analysis showed 
p-values of 4.05 × 10-10 and 2.21 × 10-6. Thus, studying genes reported to 
interact with glatiramer acetate we identified genetic variants that 
concordantly with the drug increase the risk of CAD. Of these, TGFB1 displayed 
signal for association. Indeed, the gene has been associated with CAD previously 
in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Here we establish genome-wide significant 
association with CAD in large human samples.

Excessive mRNA translation downstream of group I metabotropic glutamate 
receptors (mGlu1/5) is a core pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome (FX); 
however, the differentially translating mRNAs that contribute to altered neural 
function are not known. We used translating ribosome affinity purification 
(TRAP) and RNA-seq to identify mistranslating mRNAs in CA1 pyramidal neurons of 
the FX mouse model (Fmr1-/y) hippocampus, which exhibit exaggerated 
mGlu1/5-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD). In these neurons, we find 
that the Chrm4 transcript encoding muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) is 
excessively translated, and synthesis of M4 downstream of mGlu5 activation is 
mimicked and occluded. Surprisingly, enhancement rather than inhibition of M4 
activity normalizes core phenotypes in the Fmr1-/y, including excessive protein 
synthesis, exaggerated mGluR-LTD, and audiogenic seizures. These results suggest 
that not all excessively translated mRNAs in the Fmr1-/y brain are detrimental, 
and some may be candidates for enhancement to correct pathological changes in 
the FX brain.

This study highlights the relevance of network-guided controllability analysis 
as a precision oncology tool. Target controllability through networks is 
potentially relevant to cancer research for the identification of therapeutic 
targets. With reference to a recent study on multiple phenotypes from 22 
osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines characterized both in vitro and in vivo, we found 
that a variety of critical proteins in OS regulation circuits were in part 
phenotype specific and in part shared. To generalize our inference approach and 
match cancer phenotypic heterogeneity, we employed multitype networks and 
identified targets in correspondence with protein sub-complexes. Therefore, we 
established the relevance for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes of inspecting 
interactive targets, namely those enriched by significant connectivity patterns 
in protein sub-complexes. Emerging targets appeared with reference to the OS 
microenvironment, and relatively to small leucine-rich proteoglycan members and 
D-type cyclins, among other collagen, laminin, and keratin proteins. These 
described were evidences shared across all phenotypes; instead, specific 
evidences were provided by critical proteins including IGFBP7 and PDGFRA in the 
invasive phenotype, and FGFR3 and THBS1 in the colony forming phenotype.

Most human epithelial tumors harbor numerous alterations, making it difficult to 
predict which genes are required for tumor survival. To systematically identify 
cancer dependencies, we analyzed 501 genome-scale loss-of-function screens 
performed in diverse human cancer cell lines. We developed DEMETER, an 
analytical framework that segregates on- from off-target effects of RNAi. 769 
genes were differentially required in subsets of these cell lines at a threshold 
of six SDs from the mean. We found predictive models for 426 dependencies (55%) 
by nonlinear regression modeling considering 66,646 molecular features. Many 
dependencies fall into a limited number of classes, and unexpectedly, in 82% of 
models, the top biomarkers were expression based. We demonstrated the basis 
behind one such predictive model linking hypermethylation of the UBB ubiquitin 
gene to a dependency on UBC. Together, these observations provide a foundation 
for a cancer dependency map that facilitates the prioritization of therapeutic 
targets.

Genes whose function is selectively essential in the presence of 
cancer-associated genetic aberrations represent promising targets for the 
development of precision therapeutics. Here, we present CancerGD, a resource 
that integrates genotypic profiling with large-scale loss-of-function genetic 
screens in tumor cell lines to identify such genetic dependencies. CancerGD 
provides tools for searching, visualizing, and interpreting these genetic 
dependencies through the integration of functional interaction networks. 
CancerGD includes different screen types (siRNA, shRNA, CRISPR), and we describe 
a simple format for submitting new datasets.

Increasing age is a risk factor for many diseases; therefore developing 
pharmacological interventions that slow down ageing and consequently postpone 
the onset of many age-related diseases is highly desirable. In this work we 
analyse data from the DrugAge database, which contains chemical compounds and 
their effect on the lifespan of model organisms. Predictive models were built 
using the machine learning method random forests to predict whether or not a 
chemical compound will increase Caenorhabditis elegans' lifespan, using as 
features Gene Ontology (GO) terms annotated for proteins targeted by the 
compounds and chemical descriptors calculated from each compound's chemical 
structure. The model with the best predictive accuracy used both biological and 
chemical features, achieving a prediction accuracy of 80%. The top 20 most 
important GO terms include those related to mitochondrial processes, to 
enzymatic and immunological processes, and terms related to metabolic and 
transport processes. We applied our best model to predict compounds which are 
more likely to increase C. elegans' lifespan in the DGIdb database, where the 
effect of the compounds on an organism's lifespan is unknown. The top hit 
compounds can be broadly divided into four groups: compounds affecting 
mitochondria, compounds for cancer treatment, anti-inflammatories, and compounds 
for gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapies.

Despite global progress in research, improved screening and refined treatment 
strategies, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains as the third most common malignancy. 
As each type of cancer is different and exhibits unique alteration patterns, 
identifying and characterizing gene alterations in CRC that may serve as 
biomarkers might help to improve diagnosis, prognosis and predict potential 
response to therapy. With the emergence of next generation sequencing 
technologies (NGS), it is now possible to extensively and rapidly identify the 
gene profile of individual tumors. In this study, we aimed to identify 
actionable somatic alterations in Dukes' B and C in CRC via NGS. Targeted 
sequencing of 409 cancer-related genes using the Ion AmpliseqTM Comprehensive 
Cancer Panel was performed on genomic DNA obtained from paired fresh frozen 
tissues, cancer and normal, of Dukes' B (n = 10) and Dukes' C (n = 9) CRC. The 
sequencing results were analyzed using Torrent Suite, annotated using ANNOVAR 
and validated using Sanger sequencing. A total of 141 somatic non-synonymous 
sequence variations were identified in 86 genes. Among these, 64 variants (45%) 
were predicted to be deleterious, 38 variants (27%) possibly deleterious while 
the other 39 variants (28%) have low or neutral protein impact. Seventeen genes 
have alterations with frequencies of ≥10% in the patient cohort and with 14 
overlapped genes in both Dukes' B and C. The adenomatous polyposis coli gene 
(APC) was the most frequently altered gene in both groups (n = 6 in Dukes' B and 
C). In addition, TP53 was more frequently altered in Dukes' C (n = 7) compared 
to Dukes' B (n = 4). Ten variants in APC, namely p.R283∗, p.N778fs, p.R805∗, 
p.Y935fs, p.E941fs, p.E1057∗, p.I1401fs, p.Q1378∗, p.E1379∗, and p.A1485fs were 
predicted to be driver variants. APC remains as the most frequently altered gene 
in the intermediate stages of CRC. Wnt signaling pathway is the major affected 
pathway followed by P53, RAS, TGF-β, and PI3K signaling. We reported the 
alteration profiles in each of the patient which has the potential to affect the 
clinical decision. We believe that this study will add further to the 
understanding of CRC molecular landscape.

BACKGROUND: Onco-proteogenomics aims to understand how changes in a cancer's 
genome influences its proteome. One challenge in integrating these molecular 
data is the identification of aberrant protein products from mass-spectrometry 
(MS) datasets, as traditional proteomic analyses only identify proteins from a 
reference sequence database.
METHODS: We established proteomic workflows to detect peptide variants within MS 
datasets. We used a combination of publicly available population variants (dbSNP 
and UniProt) and somatic variations in cancer (COSMIC) along with 
sample-specific genomic and transcriptomic data to examine proteome variation 
within and across 59 cancer cell-lines.
RESULTS: We developed a set of recommendations for the detection of variants 
using three search algorithms, a split target-decoy approach for FDR estimation, 
and multiple post-search filters. We examined 7.3 million unique variant tryptic 
peptides not found within any reference proteome and identified 4771 mutations 
corresponding to somatic and germline deviations from reference proteomes in 
2200 genes among the NCI60 cell-line proteomes.
CONCLUSIONS: We discuss in detail the technical and computational challenges in 
identifying variant peptides by MS and show that uncovering these variants 
allows the identification of druggable mutations within important cancer genes.

Identifying the prognostic genes in cancer is essential not only for the 
treatment of cancer patients, but also for drug discovery. However, it's still a 
big challenge to select the prognostic genes that can distinguish the risk of 
cancer patients across various data sets because of tumor heterogeneity. In this 
situation, the selected genes whose expression levels are statistically related 
to prognostic risks may be passengers. In this paper, based on gene expression 
data and prognostic data of ovarian cancer patients, we used conditional mutual 
information to construct gene dependency network in which the nodes (genes) with 
more out-degrees have more chances to be the modulators of cancer prognosis. 
After that, we proposed DirGenerank (Generank in direct netowrk) algorithm, 
which concerns both the gene dependency network and genes' correlations to 
prognostic risks, to identify the gene signature that can predict the prognostic 
risks of ovarian cancer patients. Using ovarian cancer data set from TCGA (The 
Cancer Genome Atlas) as training data set, 40 genes with the highest importance 
were selected as prognostic signature. Survival analysis of these patients 
divided by the prognostic signature in testing data set and four independent 
data sets showed the signature can distinguish the prognostic risks of cancer 
patients significantly. Enrichment analysis of the signature with curated cancer 
genes and the drugs selected by CMAP showed the genes in the signature may be 
drug targets for therapy. In summary, we have proposed a useful pipeline to 
identify prognostic genes of cancer patients.

Small-molecule chemical probes or tools have become progressively more important 
in recent years as valuable reagents to investigate fundamental biological 
mechanisms and processes causing disease, including cancer. Chemical probes have 
also achieved greater prominence alongside complementary biological reagents for 
target validation in drug discovery. However, there is evidence of widespread 
continuing misuse and promulgation of poor-quality and insufficiently selective 
chemical probes, perpetuating a worrisome and misleading pollution of the 
scientific literature. We discuss current challenges with the selection and use 
of chemical probes, and suggest how biologists can and should be more 
discriminating in the probes they employ.

A triple-negative breast cancer patient had no hereditary BRCA1, BRCA2, or TP53 
risk variants. After exhaustion of standard treatments, she underwent 
experimental treatments and whole-exome sequencing of tumor, blood, and a 
metastasis. Well-tolerated experimental bortezomib monotherapy was administered 
for a progression-free period of 11 mo. After progression, treatments were 
changed and the exome data were evaluated, expanded with RNA and exome 
sequencing of a late-stage metastasis. In the final stage, eribulin alone and in 
combination with anthracyclines were administered. While suffering from grade 3 
adverse events, skin metastases progressed. She lived 51 mo after initial 
diagnosis.Toxicity from anthracyclines and cisplatin may have been due to 
associated germline variants CBR3 C4Y and V224M and GSTP1 I105V, respectively. 
Somatic mutations predicted or reported as pathogenic were detected in 38 genes 
in tumor tissues. All tumor samples harbored the heterozygous TP53 Y220C 
variant, known to destabilize p53 and down-regulate p53-mediated apoptosis. The 
success of bortezomib may be explained by the previously reported up-regulation 
of caspase-mediated apoptosis, which is p53-independent. Phylogenetic analysis 
of blood, primary tumor, and two metastases inferred an ancestral tumor cell 
with 12 expressed tumor mutations from which all three tumors may have 
evolved.Although our first urgent analysis could only include 40 genes, 
postmortem analysis uncovered the aggressiveness and suggested experimental 
therapies including 16 actionable targets, partly validated by 
immunohistochemistry. Exome and transcriptome analyses yielded comprehensive 
therapy-relevant information and should be considered for patients at first 
diagnosis.

Cancer therapies have experienced rapid progress in recent years, with a number 
of novel small-molecule kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies now being 
widely used to treat various types of human cancers. During cancer treatments, 
mutations can have important effects on drug sensitivity. However, the 
relationship between tumor genomic profiles and the effectiveness of cancer 
drugs remains elusive. We introduce Mutation To Cancer Therapy Scan (mTCTScan) 
web server (http://jjwanglab.org/mTCTScan) that can systematically analyze 
mutations affecting cancer drug sensitivity based on individual genomic 
profiles. The platform was developed by leveraging the latest knowledge on 
mutation-cancer drug sensitivity associations and the results from large-scale 
chemical screening using human cancer cell lines. Using an evidence-based 
scoring scheme based on current integrative evidences, mTCTScan is able to 
prioritize mutations according to their associations with cancer drugs and 
preclinical compounds. It can also show related drugs/compounds with sensitivity 
classification by considering the context of the entire genomic profile. In 
addition, mTCTScan incorporates comprehensive filtering functions and 
cancer-related annotations to better interpret mutation effects and their 
association with cancer drugs. This platform will greatly benefit both 
researchers and clinicians for interrogating mechanisms of mutation-dependent 
drug response, which will have a significant impact on cancer precision 
medicine.

Gastric cancer (GC) remains the second tumor caused death threat worldwide, and 
personalized medicine for GC is far from expectation. Finding novel, recurrently 
mutated genes through next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful and 
productive approach. However, previous genomic data for GC are based on surgical 
resected samples while a large proportion of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) 
patients have already missed the chance for operation. The aim of this study is 
to assess frequent genomic alteration in AGC via biopsy samples. Here we 
performed targeted genomic sequencing of 78 AGC patients' tumor biopsies along 
with matched lymphocyte samples based on a 118 cancer related gene panel. In 
total, we observed 301 somatic nonsynonymous genomic alterations in 92 different 
genes, as well as 37 copy number gain events among 15 different genes (fold 
change 2-12), and validated the fold changes of ERBB2 copy number gains with IHC 
and FISH test showed an accuracy of 81.8%. Previously reported driver genes for 
gastric cancer (TP53, KMT2D, KMT2B, EGFR, PIK3CA, GNAQ, and ARID1A), and several 
unreported mutations (TGFBR2, RNF213, NF1, NSD1, and LRP2) showed high 
non-silent mutation prevalence (7.7%-34.6%). When comparing intestinal-type 
gastric cancer (IGC) with diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC), TP53 and GNAQ 
appear to be more frequently mutated in IGC (P=0.028 and P=0.023, respectively), 
whereas LRP2, BRCA2 and FGFR3 mutations are not observed in IGC, but have 12.8%, 
7.7% and 7.7% mutation rates, respectively, in DGC patients. Patients with one 
or more mutations in adherens junction pathway (CREBBP, EP300, CDH1, CTNNB1, 
EGFR, MET, TGFBR2 and ERBB2) or TGF-β signaling pathway (CREBBP, EP300, MYST4, 
KRAS and TGFBR2) showed significantly better overall survival (P=0.007 and 
P=0.014, respectively), consistent with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort 
data. Importantly, 57 (73.1%) patients harbored at least one genomic alteration 
with potential treatments, making NGS-based drug target screening a viable 
option for AGC patients. Our study established a comprehensive genomic portrait 
of AGC, and identified several mutation signatures highly associated with 
clinical features, survival outcomes, which may be used to design future 
personalized treatments.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify potential prostate cancer (PC)-related 
variations in gene expression profiles.
METHODS: Microarray data from the GSE21032 dataset that contained the 
whole-transcript and exon-level expression profile (GSE21034) and Agilent 244K 
array-comparative genomic hybridization data (GSE21035) were downloaded from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 
copy-number variations (CNVs) were identified between PC and normal tissue 
samples. Coexpression interactions of DEGs that contained CNVs (CNV-DEGs) were 
analyzed. Pathway enrichment analysis of CNV-DEGs was performed. Drugs targeting 
CNV-DEGs were searched using the Drug-Gene Interaction database.
RESULTS: In total, 679 DEGs were obtained, including 182 upregulated genes and 
497 downregulated genes. A total of 48 amplified CNV regions and 45 deleted 
regions were determined. The number of CNVs at 8q and 8p was relatively higher 
in PC tissue. Only 16 DEGs, including 4 upregulated and 12 downregulated genes, 
showed a positive correlation with CNVs. In the coexpression network, 3 
downregulated CNV-DEGs, including FAT4 (FAT atypical cadherin 4), PDE5A 
(phosphodiesterase 5A, cGMP-specific), and PCP4 (Purkinje cell protein 4), had a 
higher degree, and were enriched in specific pathways such as the calmodulin 
signaling pathway. Five of the 16 CNV-DEGs (e.g., PDE5A) were identified as drug 
targets.
CONCLUSION: The identified CNV-DEGs could be implicated in the progression of 
human PC. The findings could lead to a better understanding of PC pathogenesis.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death, and the past years' 
improved insight into underlying molecular events has significantly improved 
outcome for specific subsets of patients. In particular, several new therapies 
that target protein kinases have been implemented, and many more are becoming 
available. We have investigated lung cancer specimens for somatic mutations in a 
targeted panel of 612 human genes, the majority being protein kinases. The 
somatic mutation profiles were correlated to profiles of immune cell 
infiltration as well as relapse-free survival. Targeted deep sequencing was 
performed on 117 tumour/normal pairs using the SureSelect Human Kinome kit 
(Agilent Technologies), with capture probes targeting 3.2 Mb of the human 
genome, including exons and untranslated regions of all known kinases, kinase 
receptors and selected cancer-related genes (612 genes in total). CD8 staining 
was determined using Ventana Benchmark. Survival analyses were performed using 
SPSS. The number of mutations per sample ranged from 0 to 50 (within the 612 
genes tested), with a median of nine. The prognosis was worse for patients with 
more than the median number of mutations. A significant correlation was found 
between mutations in one of selected DNA-repair genes and the total number of 
mutations in that tumour (p < 0.001). There was a significant inverse 
correlation between the number of infiltrating stromal CD8+ lymphocytes and the 
presence of EGFR mutations.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) pose critical public health issues, affecting over 
6% of hospitalized patients. While knowledge of potential drug-drug interactions 
(DDI) is necessary to prevent ADR, the rapid pace of drug discovery makes it 
challenging to maintain a strong insight into DDIs. In this study, we present a 
novel literature-mining framework for enhancing the predictions of DDIs and ADR 
types by integrating drug-gene interactions (DGIs). The ADR types were adapted 
from a DDI corpus, including i) adverse effect; ii) effect at molecular level; 
iii) effect related to pharmacokinetics; and iv) DDIs without known ADRs. By 
using random forest classifier our approach achieves an F-score of 0.87 across 
the ADRs classification using only the DDI features. We then enhanced the 
performance of the classifier by including DGIs (F-score = 0.90), and applied 
the classification model trained with the DDI corpus to identify the drugs that 
might interact with the drugs for cutaneous diseases. We successfully predict 
previously known ADRs for drugs prescribed to cutaneous diseases, and are also 
able to identify promising new ADRs.

The aim of this study was to design a road map for personalizing cancer therapy 
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using molecular pattern diagnostics. As an 
exploratory study, we investigated molecular patterns of tissues of two tumors 
from individual HCC patients, which in previous experiments had shown 
contrasting reactions to the phase 2 transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 
inhibitor galunisertib. Cancer-driving molecular patterns encompass - inter 
alias - altered transcription profiles and somatic mutations in coding regions 
differentiating tumors from their respective peritumoral tissues and from each 
other. Massive analysis of cDNA ends and all-exome sequencing demonstrate a 
highly divergent transcriptional and mutational landscape, respectively, for the 
two tumors, that offers potential explanations for the tumors contrasting 
responses to galunisertib. Molecular pattern diagnostics (MPDs) suggest 
alternative, individual-tumor-specific therapies, which in both cases deviate 
from the standard sorafenib treatment and from each other. Suggested 
personalized therapies use kinase inhibitors and immune-focused drugs as well as 
low-toxicity natural compounds identified using an advanced bioinformatics 
routine included in the MPD protocol. The MPD pipeline we describe here for the 
prediction of suitable drugs for treatment of two contrasting HCCs may serve as 
a blueprint for the design of therapies for various types of cancer.

Gene expression is perturbated by drugs to different extent. Analyzing genes 
whose expression is frequently regulated by drugs would be useful for the 
screening of candidate therapeutic targets and genes implicated in side effect. 
Here, we obtained the differential expression number (DEN) for genes profiled in 
Affymetrix microarrays from the Connectivity Map project, and conducted systemic 
comparative computational analysis between high DEN genes and other genes. 
Results indicated that genes with higher down-/up-regulation number 
(down_h/up_h) tended to be clustered in genome, and have lower homologous gene 
number, higher SNP density and more disease-related SNP. Down_h and up_h were 
significantly enriched in cancer related pathways, while genes with lower 
down-/up-regulation number (down_l/up_l) were mainly involved in the development 
of nervous system diseases. Besides, up_h had lower interaction network degree, 
later developmental stage to express, higher tissue expression specificity than 
up_l, while down_h showed reversed tendency in comparison with down_l. Together, 
our analysis suggests that genes frequently regulated by drugs are more likely 
to be associated with disease-related functions, but the extensive activation of 
conserved and widely expressed genes by drugs is disfavored.

Aging is a major worldwide medical challenge. Not surprisingly, identifying 
drugs and compounds that extend lifespan in model organisms is a growing 
research area. Here, we present DrugAge 
(http://genomics.senescence.info/drugs/), a curated database of 
lifespan-extending drugs and compounds. At the time of writing, DrugAge contains 
1316 entries featuring 418 different compounds from studies across 27 model 
organisms, including worms, flies, yeast and mice. Data were manually curated 
from 324 publications. Using drug-gene interaction data, we also performed a 
functional enrichment analysis of targets of lifespan-extending drugs. Enriched 
terms include various functional categories related to glutathione and 
antioxidant activity, ion transport and metabolic processes. In addition, we 
found a modest but significant overlap between targets of lifespan-extending 
drugs and known aging-related genes, suggesting that some but not most 
aging-related pathways have been targeted pharmacologically in longevity 
studies. DrugAge is freely available online for the scientific community and 
will be an important resource for biogerontologists.

Two genes are synthetically lethal (SL) when defects in both are lethal to a 
cell but a single defect is non-lethal. SL partners of cancer mutations are of 
great interest as pharmacological targets; however, identifying them by cell 
line-based methods is challenging. Here we develop MiSL (Mining Synthetic 
Lethals), an algorithm that mines pan-cancer human primary tumour data to 
identify mutation-specific SL partners for specific cancers. We apply MiSL to 12 
different cancers and predict 145,891 SL partners for 3,120 mutations, including 
known mutation-specific SL partners. Comparisons with functional screens show 
that MiSL predictions are enriched for SLs in multiple cancers. We extensively 
validate a SL interaction identified by MiSL between the IDH1 mutation and ACACA 
in leukaemia using gene targeting and patient-derived xenografts. Furthermore, 
we apply MiSL to pinpoint genetic biomarkers for drug sensitivity. These results 
demonstrate that MiSL can accelerate precision oncology by identifying 
mutation-specific targets and biomarkers.

Approximately half of the world's 500,000 new oesophageal squamous-cell 
carcinoma (ESCC) cases each year occur in China. Here, we show whole-genome 
sequencing of DNA and RNA in 94 Chinese individuals with ESCC. We identify six 
mutational signatures (E1-E6), and Signature E4 is unique in ESCC linked to 
alcohol intake and genetic variants in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes. We discover 
significantly recurrent mutations in 20 protein-coding genes, 4 long non-coding 
RNAs and 10 untranslational regions. Functional analyses show six genes that 
have recurrent copy-number variants in three squamous-cell carcinomas 
(oesophageal, head and neck and lung) significantly promote cancer cell 
proliferation, migration and invasion. The most frequently affected genes by 
structural variation are LRP1B and TTC28. The aberrant cell cycle and PI3K-AKT 
pathways seem critical in ESCC. These results establish a comprehensive genomic 
landscape of ESCC and provide potential targets for precision treatment and 
prevention of the cancer.

BACKGROUND: An increasing number of precision oncology programmes are being 
launched world-wide. To support this development, we present the Cancer Variant 
Explorer (CVE), an R package with an interactive Shiny web browser interface.
RESULTS: Leveraging Oncotator and the Drug Gene Interaction Database, CVE offers 
exploration of variants within single or multiple tumour exomes to identify 
drivers, resistance mechanisms and to assess druggability. We present example 
applications including the analysis of an individual patient and a cohort-wide 
study, and provide a first extension of CVE by adding a tumour-specific 
co-expression network.
CONCLUSIONS: The CVE package allows interactive variant prioritisation to 
expedite the analysis of cancer sequencing studies. Our framework also includes 
the prioritisation of druggable targets, allows exploratory analysis of tissue 
specific networks and is extendable for specific applications by virtue of its 
modular design. We encourage the use of CVE within translational research 
studies and molecular tumour boards. The CVE package is available via 
Bioconductor ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/CVE/ ).

BACKGROUND: A microRNA (miRNA) collection on the imprinted 14q32 MEG3 region has 
been associated with outcome in osteosarcoma. We assessed the clinical utility 
of this miRNA set and their association with methylation status.
METHODS: We integrated coding and non-coding RNA data from three independent 
annotated clinical osteosarcoma cohorts (n = 65, n = 27, and n = 25) and miRNA 
and methylation data from one in vitro (19 cell lines) and one clinical (NCI 
Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) 
osteosarcoma dataset, n = 80) dataset. We used time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic (tdROC) analysis to evaluate the clinical value of candidate 
miRNA profiles and machine learning approaches to compare the coding and 
non-coding transcriptional programs of high- and low-risk osteosarcoma tumors 
and high- versus low-aggressiveness cell lines. In the cell line and TARGET 
datasets, we also studied the methylation patterns of the MEG3 imprinting 
control region on 14q32 and their association with miRNA expression and tumor 
aggressiveness.
RESULTS: In the tdROC analysis, miRNA sets on 14q32 showed strong discriminatory 
power for recurrence and survival in the three clinical datasets. High- or 
low-risk tumor classification was robust to using different microRNA sets or 
classification methods. Machine learning approaches showed that genome-wide 
miRNA profiles and miRNA regulatory networks were quite different between the 
two outcome groups and mRNA profiles categorized the samples in a manner 
concordant with the miRNAs, suggesting potential molecular subtypes. Further, 
miRNA expression patterns were reproducible in comparing high-aggressiveness 
versus low-aggressiveness cell lines. Methylation patterns in the MEG3 
differentially methylated region (DMR) also distinguished high-aggressiveness 
from low-aggressiveness cell lines and were associated with expression of 
several 14q32 miRNAs in both the cell lines and the large TARGET clinical 
dataset. Within the limits of available CpG array coverage, we observed a 
potential methylation-sensitive regulation of the non-coding RNA cluster by 
CTCF, a known enhancer-blocking factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss of imprinting/methylation changes in the 14q32 non-coding 
region defines reproducible previously unrecognized osteosarcoma subtypes with 
distinct transcriptional programs and biologic and clinical behavior. Future 
studies will define the precise relationship between 14q32 imprinting, 
non-coding RNA expression, genomic enhancer binding, and tumor aggressiveness, 
with possible therapeutic implications for both early- and advanced-stage 
patients.

Spatial heterogeneity of transcriptional and genetic markers between physically 
isolated biopsies of a single tumor poses major barriers to the identification 
of biomarkers and the development of targeted therapies that will be effective 
against the entire tumor. We analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of multiregional 
biopsies from 35 patients, using a combination of transcriptomic and genomic 
profiles. Medulloblastomas (MBs), but not high-grade gliomas (HGGs), 
demonstrated spatially homogeneous transcriptomes, which allowed for accurate 
subgrouping of tumors from a single biopsy. Conversely, somatic mutations that 
affect genes suitable for targeted therapeutics demonstrated high levels of 
spatial heterogeneity in MB, malignant glioma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
Actionable targets found in a single MB biopsy were seldom clonal across the 
entire tumor, which brings the efficacy of monotherapies against a single target 
into question. Clinical trials of targeted therapies for MB should first ensure 
the spatially ubiquitous nature of the target mutation.

IMPORTANCE: Patients with breast cancer (BrCa) brain metastases (BrM) have 
limited therapeutic options. A better understanding of molecular alterations 
acquired in BrM could identify clinically actionable metastatic dependencies.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are intrinsic subtype differences between 
primary tumors and matched BrM and to uncover BrM-acquired alterations that are 
clinically actionable.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 20 cases of primary breast cancer 
tissue and resected BrM (10 estrogen receptor [ER]-negative and 10 ER-positive) 
from 2 academic institutions were included. Eligible cases in the discovery 
cohort harbored patient-matched primary breast cancer tissue and resected BrM. 
Given the rarity of patient-matched samples, no exclusion criteria were enacted. 
Two validation sequencing cohorts were used-a published data set of 17 
patient-matched cases of BrM and a cohort of 7884 BrCa tumors enriched for 
metastatic samples.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Brain metastases expression changes in 127 genes 
within BrCa signatures, PAM50 assignments, and ERBB2/HER2 DNA-level gains.
RESULTS: Overall, 17 of 20 BrM retained the PAM50 subtype of the primary BrCa. 
Despite this concordance, 17 of 20 BrM harbored expression changes (<2-fold or 
>2-fold) in clinically actionable genes including gains of FGFR4 (n = 6 [30%]), 
FLT1 (n = 4 [20%]), AURKA (n = 2 [10%]) and loss of ESR1 expression (n = 9 
[45%]). The most recurrent expression gain was ERBB2/HER2, which showed a 
greater than 2-fold expression increase in 7 of 20 BrM (35%). Three of these 7 
cases were ERBB2/HER2-negative out of 13 ERBB2/HER2-negative in the primary BrCa 
cohort and became immunohistochemical positive (3+) in the paired BrM with 
metastasis-specific amplification of the ERBB2/HER2 locus. In an independent 
data set, 2 of 9 (22.2%) ERBB2/HER2-negative BrCa switched to 
ERBB2/HER2-positive with 1 BrM acquiring ERBB2/HER2 amplification and the other 
showing metastatic enrichment of the activating V777L ERBB2/HER2 mutation. An 
expanded cohort revealed that ERBB2/HER2 amplification and/or mutation frequency 
was unchanged between local disease and metastases across all sites; however, a 
significant enrichment was appreciated for BrM (13% local vs 24% BrM; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Breast cancer BrM commonly acquire alterations in 
clinically actionable genes, with metastasis-acquired ERBB2/HER2 alterations in 
approximately 20% of ERBB2/HER2-negative cases. These observations have 
immediate clinical implications for patients with ERBB2/HER2-negative breast 
cancer and support comprehensive profiling of metastases to inform clinical 
care.

BACKGROUND: A standard task in pharmacogenomics research is identifying genes 
that may be involved in drug response variability, i.e., pharmacogenes. Because 
genomic experiments tended to generate many false positives, computational 
approaches based on the use of background knowledge have been proposed. Until 
now, only molecular networks or the biomedical literature were used, whereas 
many other resources are available.
METHOD: We propose here to consume a diverse and larger set of resources using 
linked data related either to genes, drugs or diseases. One of the advantages of 
linked data is that they are built on a standard framework that facilitates the 
joint use of various sources, and thus facilitates considering features of 
various origins. We propose a selection and linkage of data sources relevant to 
pharmacogenomics, including for example DisGeNET and Clinvar. We use machine 
learning to identify and prioritize pharmacogenes that are the most probably 
valid, considering the selected linked data. This identification relies on the 
classification of gene-drug pairs as either pharmacogenomically associated or 
not and was experimented with two machine learning methods -random forest and 
graph kernel-, which results are compared in this article.
RESULTS: We assembled a set of linked data relative to pharmacogenomics, of 
2,610,793 triples, coming from six distinct resources. Learning from these data, 
random forest enables identifying valid pharmacogenes with a F-measure of 0.73, 
on a 10 folds cross-validation, whereas graph kernel achieves a F-measure of 
0.81. A list of top candidates proposed by both approaches is provided and their 
obtention is discussed.

We are performing whole-genome sequencing of families with autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) to build a resource (MSSNG) for subcategorizing the phenotypes 
and underlying genetic factors involved. Here we report sequencing of 5,205 
samples from families with ASD, accompanied by clinical information, creating a 
database accessible on a cloud platform and through a controlled-access internet 
portal. We found an average of 73.8 de novo single nucleotide variants and 12.6 
de novo insertions and deletions or copy number variations per ASD subject. We 
identified 18 new candidate ASD-risk genes and found that participants bearing 
mutations in susceptibility genes had significantly lower adaptive ability (P = 
6 × 10-4). In 294 of 2,620 (11.2%) of ASD cases, a molecular basis could be 
determined and 7.2% of these carried copy number variations and/or chromosomal 
abnormalities, emphasizing the importance of detecting all forms of genetic 
variation as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in ASD.

Target identification (determining the correct drug targets for a disease) and 
target validation (demonstrating an effect of target perturbation on disease 
biomarkers and disease end points) are important steps in drug development. 
Clinically relevant associations of variants in genes encoding drug targets 
model the effect of modifying the same targets pharmacologically. To delineate 
drug development (including repurposing) opportunities arising from this 
paradigm, we connected complex disease- and biomarker-associated loci from 
genome-wide association studies to an updated set of genes encoding druggable 
human proteins, to agents with bioactivity against these targets, and, where 
there were licensed drugs, to clinical indications. We used this set of genes to 
inform the design of a new genotyping array, which will enable association 
studies of druggable genes for drug target selection and validation in human 
disease.

BACKGROUND: De novo inference of clinically relevant gene function relationships 
from tumor RNA-seq remains a challenging task. Current methods typically either 
partition patient samples into a few subtypes or rely upon analysis of pairwise 
gene correlations that will miss some groups in noisy data. Leveraging higher 
dimensional information can be expected to increase the power to discern 
targetable pathways, but this is commonly thought to be an intractable 
computational problem.
METHODS: In this work we adapt a recently developed machine learning algorithm 
for sensitive detection of complex gene relationships. The algorithm, CorEx, 
efficiently optimizes over multivariate mutual information and can be 
iteratively applied to generate a hierarchy of relatively independent latent 
factors. The learned latent factors are used to stratify patients for survival 
analysis with respect to both single factors and combinations. These analyses 
are performed and interpreted in the context of biological function annotations 
and protein network interactions that might be utilized to match patients to 
multiple therapies.
RESULTS: Analysis of ovarian tumor RNA-seq samples demonstrates the algorithm's 
power to infer well over one hundred biologically interpretable gene cohorts, 
several times more than standard methods such as hierarchical clustering and 
k-means. The CorEx factor hierarchy is also informative, with related but 
distinct gene clusters grouped by upper nodes. Some latent factors correlate 
with patient survival, including one for a pathway connected with the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer that is regulated by a 
microRNA that modulates epigenetics. Further, combinations of factors lead to a 
synergistic survival advantage in some cases.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to studies that attempt to partition patients into a 
small number of subtypes (typically 4 or fewer) for treatment purposes, our 
approach utilizes subgroup information for combinatoric transcriptional 
phenotyping. Considering only the 66 gene expression groups that are found to 
both have significant Gene Ontology enrichment and are small enough to indicate 
specific drug targets implies a computational phenotype for ovarian cancer that 
allows for 366 possible patient profiles, enabling truly personalized treatment. 
The findings here demonstrate a new technique that sheds light on the complexity 
of gene expression dependencies in tumors and could eventually enable the use of 
patient RNA-seq profiles for selection of personalized and effective cancer 
treatments.

c-Myc dysregulation is hypothesized to account for the 'stemness' - self-renewal 
and pluripotency - shared between embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult 
aggressive tumours. High-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) is the most frequent, 
aggressive, extracranial solid tumour in childhood. Using HR-NB as a platform, 
we performed a network analysis of transcriptome data and presented a c-Myc 
subnetwork enriched for genes previously reported as ESC-like cancer signatures. 
A subsequent drug-gene interaction analysis identified a pharmacogenomic agent 
that preferentially interacted with this HR-NB-specific, ESC-like signature. 
This agent, Roniciclib (BAY 1000394), inhibited neuroblastoma cell growth and 
induced apoptosis in vitro. It also repressed the expression of the oncogene 
c-Myc and the neural ESC marker CDK2 in vitro, which was accompanied by altered 
expression of the c-Myc-targeted cell cycle regulators CCND1, CDKN1A and CDKN2D 
in a time-dependent manner. Further investigation into this HR-NB-specific 
ESC-like signature in 295 and 243 independent patients revealed and validated 
the general prognostic index of CDK2 and CDKN3 compared with CDKN2D and CDKN1B. 
These findings highlight the very potent therapeutic benefits of Roniciclib in 
HR-NB through the targeting of c-Myc-regulated, ESC-like tumorigenesis. This 
work provides a hypothesis-driven systems computational model that facilitates 
the translation of genomic and transcriptomic signatures to molecular mechanisms 
underlying high-risk tumours.

This study presents an analysis of the small molecule bioactivity profiles 
across large quantities of diverse protein families represented in PubChem 
BioAssay. We compared the bioactivity profiles of FDA approved drugs to non-FDA 
approved compounds, and report several distinct patterns characteristic of the 
approved drugs. We found that a large fraction of the previously reported higher 
target promiscuity among FDA approved compounds, compared to non-FDA approved 
bioactives, was frequently due to cross-reactivity within rather than across 
protein families. We identified 804 potentially novel protein target candidates 
for FDA approved drugs, as well as 901 potentially novel target candidates with 
active non-FDA approved compounds, but no FDA approved drugs with activity 
against these targets. We also identified 486348 potentially novel compounds 
active against the same targets as FDA approved drugs, as well as 153402 
potentially novel compounds active against targets without active FDA approved 
drugs. By quantifying the agreement among replicated screens, we estimated that 
more than half of these novel outcomes are reproducible. Using biclustering, we 
identified many dense clusters of FDA approved drugs with enriched activity 
against a common set of protein targets. We also report the distribution of 
compound promiscuity using a Bayesian statistical model, and report the 
sensitivity and specificity of two common methods for identifying promiscuous 
compounds. Aggregator assays exhibited greater accuracy in identifying highly 
promiscuous compounds, while PAINS substructures were able to identify a much 
larger set of "middle range" promiscuous compounds. Additionally, we report a 
large number of promiscuous compounds not identified as aggregators or PAINS. In 
summary, the results of this study represent a rich reference for selecting 
novel drug and target protein candidates, as well as for eliminating candidate 
compounds with unselective activities.

We present POSTAR (http://POSTAR.ncrnalab.org), a resource of 
POST-trAnscriptional Regulation coordinated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). 
Precise characterization of post-transcriptional regulatory maps has accelerated 
dramatically in the past few years. Based on new studies and resources, POSTAR 
supplies the largest collection of experimentally probed (∼23 million) and 
computationally predicted (approximately 117 million) RBP binding sites in the 
human and mouse transcriptomes. POSTAR annotates every transcript and its RBP 
binding sites using extensive information regarding various molecular regulatory 
events (e.g., splicing, editing, and modification), RNA secondary structures, 
disease-associated variants, and gene expression and function. Moreover, POSTAR 
provides a friendly, multi-mode, integrated search interface, which helps users 
to connect multiple RBP binding sites with post-transcriptional regulatory 
events, phenotypes, and diseases. Based on our platform, we were able to obtain 
novel insights into post-transcriptional regulation, such as the putative 
association between CPSF6 binding, RNA structural domains, and Li-Fraumeni 
syndrome SNPs. In summary, POSTAR represents an early effort to systematically 
annotate post-transcriptional regulatory maps and explore the putative roles of 
RBPs in human diseases.

The 'druggable genome' encompasses several protein families, but only a subset 
of targets within them have attracted significant research attention and thus 
have information about them publicly available. The Illuminating the Druggable 
Genome (IDG) program was initiated in 2014, has the goal of developing 
experimental techniques and a Knowledge Management Center (KMC) that would 
collect and organize information about protein targets from four families, 
representing the most common druggable targets with an emphasis on understudied 
proteins. Here, we describe two resources developed by the KMC: the Target 
Central Resource Database (TCRD) which collates many heterogeneous gene/protein 
datasets and Pharos (https://pharos.nih.gov), a multimodal web interface that 
presents the data from TCRD. We briefly describe the types and sources of data 
considered by the KMC and then highlight features of the Pharos interface 
designed to enable intuitive access to the IDG knowledgebase. The aim of Pharos 
is to encourage 'serendipitous browsing', whereby related, relevant information 
is made easily discoverable. We conclude by describing two use cases that 
highlight the utility of Pharos and TCRD.

Molecular pathway data are essential in current computational and systems 
biology research. While there are many primary and integrated pathway databases, 
several challenges remain, including low proteome coverage (57%), low overlap 
across different databases, unavailability of direct information about 
underlying physical connectivity of pathway members, and high fraction of 
protein-coding genes without any pathway annotations, i.e. 'pathway orphans'. In 
order to address all these challenges, we developed pathDIP, which integrates 
data from 20 source pathway databases, 'core pathways', with physical 
protein-protein interactions to predict biologically relevant protein-pathway 
associations, referred to as 'extended pathways'. Cross-validation determined 
71% recovery rate of our predictions. Data integration and predictions increase 
coverage of pathway annotations for protein-coding genes to 86%, and provide 
novel annotations for 5732 pathway orphans. PathDIP 
(http://ophid.utoronto.ca/pathdip) annotates 17 070 protein-coding genes with 
4678 pathways, and provides multiple query, analysis and output options.

Current multiomics assay platforms facilitate systematic identification of 
functional entities that are mappable in a biological network, and computational 
methods that are better able to detect densely connected clusters of signals 
within a biological network are considered increasingly important. One of the 
most famous algorithms for detecting network subclusters is Molecular Complex 
Detection (MCODE). MCODE, however, is limited in simultaneous analyses of 
multiple, large-scale data sets, since it runs on the Cytoscape platform, which 
requires extensive computational resources and has limited coding flexibility. 
In the present study, we implemented the MCODE algorithm in R programming 
language and developed a related package, which we called MCODER. We found the 
MCODER package to be particularly useful in analyzing multiple omics data sets 
simultaneously within the R framework. Thus, we applied MCODER to detect 
pharmacologically tractable protein-protein interactions selectively elevated in 
molecular subtypes of ovarian and colorectal tumors. In doing so, we found that 
a single molecular subtype representing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in 
both cancer types exhibited enhanced production of the collagen-integrin protein 
complex. These results suggest that tumors of this molecular subtype could be 
susceptible to pharmacological inhibition of integrin signaling.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge of molecular marker (typically protein or mRNA) expression 
in neural systems can provide insight to the chemical blueprint of signal 
processing and transmission, assist in tracking developmental or pathological 
progressions, and yield key information regarding potential medicinal targets. 
These markers are particularly relevant in the mammalian brain in the light of 
its unsurpassed cellular diversity. Accordingly, molecular expression profiling 
is rapidly becoming a major approach to classify neuron types. Despite a 
profusion of research, however, the biological functions of molecular markers 
commonly used to distinguish neuron types remain incompletely understood. 
Furthermore, most molecular markers of mammalian neuron types are also present 
in other organs, therefore complicating considerations of their potential 
pharmacological interactions.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we survey 15 prominent neurochemical markers from five 
categories, namely membrane transporters, calcium-binding proteins, 
neuropeptides, receptors, and extracellular matrix proteins, explaining their 
relation and relevance to synaptic communication.
METHOD: For each marker, we summarize fundamental structural features, cellular 
functionality, distributions within and outside the brain, as well as known drug 
effectors and mechanisms of action.
CONCLUSION: This essential primer thus links together the cellular complexity of 
the brain, the chemical properties of key molecular players in 
neurotransmission, and possible biomedical opportunities.

High-throughput DNA sequencing techniques enable large-scale measurement of 
somatic mutations in tumors. Cancer genomics research aims at identifying all 
cancer-related genes and solid interpretation of their contribution to cancer 
initiation and development. However, this venture is characterized by various 
challenges, such as the high number of neutral passenger mutations and the 
complexity of the biological networks affected by driver mutations. Based on 
biological pathway and network information, sophisticated computational methods 
have been developed to facilitate the detection of cancer driver mutations and 
pathways. They can be categorized into (1) methods using known pathways from 
public databases, (2) network-based methods, and (3) methods learning cancer 
pathways de novo. Methods in the first two categories use and integrate 
different types of data, such as biological pathways, protein interaction 
networks, and gene expression measurements. The third category consists of de 
novo methods that detect combinatorial patterns of somatic mutations across 
tumor samples, such as mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence. In this review, we 
discuss recent advances, current limitations, and future challenges of these 
approaches for detecting cancer genes and pathways. We also discuss the most 
important current resources of cancer-related genes. WIREs Syst Biol Med 2017,

Traditionally, biologists have devoted their careers to studying individual 
biological entities of their own interest, partly due to lack of available data 
regarding that entity. Large, highthroughput data, too complex for conventional 
processing methods (i.e., "big data"), has accumulated in cancer biology, which 
is freely available in public data repositories. Such challenges urge biologists 
to inspect their biological entities of interest using novel approaches, firstly 
including repository data retrieval. Essentially, these revolutionary changes 
demand new interpretations of huge datasets at a systems-level, by so called 
"systems biology". One of the representative applications of systems biology is 
to generate a biological network from high-throughput big data, providing a 
global map of molecular events associated with specific phenotype changes. In 
this review, we introduce the repositories of cancer big data and cutting-edge 
systems biology tools for network generation, and improved identification of 
therapeutic targets. [BMB Reports 2017; 50(1): 12-19].

Considerable research efforts are being invested in the development of novel 
antimicrobial therapies effective against the growing number of multi-drug 
resistant pathogens. Notably, the combination of different agents is 
increasingly explored as means to exploit and improve individual agent actions 
while minimizing microorganism resistance. Although there are several databases 
on antimicrobial agents, scientific literature is the primary source of 
information on experimental antimicrobial combination testing. This work 
presents a semi-automated database curation workflow that supports the mining of 
scientific literature and enables the reconstruction of recently documented 
antimicrobial combinations. Currently, the database contains data on 
antimicrobial combinations that have been experimentally tested against 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria 
monocytogenes and Candida albicans, which are prominent pathogenic organisms and 
are well-known for their wide and growing resistance to conventional 
antimicrobials. Researchers are able to explore the experimental results for a 
single organism or across organisms. Likewise, researchers may look into 
indirect network associations and identify new potential combinations to be 
tested. The database is available without charges.Database URL:

Cancer results from the acquisition of somatic driver mutations. Several 
computational tools can predict driver genes from population-scale genomic data, 
but tools for analyzing personal cancer genomes are underdeveloped. Here we 
developed iCAGES, a novel statistical framework that infers driver variants by 
integrating contributions from coding, non-coding, and structural variants, 
identifies driver genes by combining genomic information and prior biological 
knowledge, then generates prioritized drug treatment. Analysis on The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed that iCAGES predicts whether patients respond to 
drug treatment (P = 0.006 by Fisher's exact test) and long-term survival 
(P = 0.003 from Cox regression). iCAGES is available at http://icages.wglab.org

BACKGROUND: Biological interpretation of genomic summary data such as those 
resulting from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies is one of the major bottlenecks in 
medical genomics research, calling for efficient and integrative tools to 
resolve this problem.
RESULTS: We introduce eXploring Genomic Relations (XGR), an open source tool 
designed for enhanced interpretation of genomic summary data enabling downstream 
knowledge discovery. Targeting users of varying computational skills, XGR 
utilises prior biological knowledge and relationships in a highly integrated but 
easily accessible way to make user-input genomic summary datasets more 
interpretable. We show how by incorporating ontology, annotation, and systems 
biology network-driven approaches, XGR generates more informative results than 
conventional analyses. We apply XGR to GWAS and eQTL summary data to explore the 
genomic landscape of the activated innate immune response and common 
immunological diseases. We provide genomic evidence for a disease taxonomy 
supporting the concept of a disease spectrum from autoimmune to autoinflammatory 
disorders. We also show how XGR can define SNP-modulated gene networks and 
pathways that are shared and distinct between diseases, how it achieves

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is common disease with a complex etiology that is 
likely due to many different genetic and environmental factors. The goal of this 
study was to embrace this complexity using a bioinformatics analysis pipeline 
designed to use machine learning to measure synergistic interactions between 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) and then to assess their enrichment within functional groups defined by 
Gene Ontology. The significance of the results was evaluated using permutation 
testing and those results that replicated between the two GWAS data sets were 
reported.
RESULTS: In the first step of our bioinformatics pipeline, we estimated the 
pairwise synergistic effects of SNPs on bladder cancer risk in both GWAS data 
sets using Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) machine learning method 
that is designed specifically for this purpose. Statistical significance was 
assessed using a 1000-fold permutation test. Each single SNP was assigned a 
p-value based on its strongest pairwise association. Each SNP was then mapped to 
one or more genes using a window of 500 kb upstream and downstream from each 
gene boundary. This window was chosen to capture as many regulatory variants as 
possible. Using Exploratory Visual Analysis (EVA), we then carried out a gene 
set enrichment analysis at the gene level to identify those genes with an 
overabundance of significant SNPs relative to the size of their mapped regions. 
Each gene was assigned to a biological functional group defined by Gene Ontology 
(GO). We next used EVA to evaluate the overabundance of significant genes in 
biological functional groups. Our study yielded one GO category, carboxy-lysase 
activity (GO:0016831), that was significant in analyses from both GWAS data 
sets. Interestingly, only the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) gene from this 
GO group was significant in both the detection and replication data, 
highlighting the complexity of the pathway-level effects on risk. The GGCX gene 
is expressed in the bladder, but has not been previously associated with bladder 
cancer in univariate GWAS. However, there is some experimental evidence that 
carboxy-lysase activity might play a role in cancer and that genes in this 
pathway should be explored as drug targets. This study provides a genetic basis 
for that observation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning analysis of genetic associations in two GWAS 
for bladder cancer identified numerous associations with pairs of SNPs. Gene set 
enrichment analysis found aggregation of risk-associated SNPs in genes and 
significant genes in GO functional groups. This study supports a role for 
decarboxylase protein complexes in bladder cancer susceptibility. Previous 
research has implicated decarboxylases in bladder cancer etiology; however, the 
genes that we found to be significant in the detection and replication data are 
not known to have direct influence on bladder cancer, suggesting some novel 
hypotheses. This study highlights the need for a complex systems approach to the 
genetic and genomic analysis of common diseases such as cancer.

Leukemia is a collection of highly heterogeneous cancers that arise from 
neoplastic transformation and clonal expansion of immature hematopoietic cells. 
Post-treatment recurrence is high, especially among elderly patients, thus 
necessitating more effective treatment modalities. Development of novel 
anti-leukemic compounds relies heavily on traditional in vitro screens which 
require extensive resources and time. Therefore, integration of in silico 
screens prior to experimental validation can improve the efficiency of 
pre-clinical drug development. Areas covered: This article reviews different 
methods and frameworks used to computationally screen for anti-leukemic agents. 
In particular, three approaches are discussed including molecular docking, 
transcriptomic integration, and network analysis. Expert opinion: Today's data 
deluge presents novel opportunities to develop computational tools and pipelines 
to screen for likely therapeutic candidates in the treatment of leukemia. Formal 
integration of these methodologies can accelerate and improve the efficiency of 
modern day anti-leukemic drug discovery and ease the economic and healthcare 
burden associated with it.

We have recently generated a novel medulloblastoma (MB) mouse model with 
activation of the Shh pathway and lacking the MB suppressor Tis21 
(Patched1+/-/Tis21KO ). Its main phenotype is a defect of migration of the 
cerebellar granule precursor cells (GCPs). By genomic analysis of GCPs in vivo, 
we identified as drug target and major responsible of this defect the 
down-regulation of the promigratory chemokine Cxcl3. Consequently, the GCPs 
remain longer in the cerebellum proliferative area, and the MB frequency is 
enhanced. Here, we further analyzed the genes deregulated in a Tis21-dependent 
manner (Patched1+/-/Tis21 wild-type vs. Ptch1+/-/Tis21 knockout), among which 
are a number of down-regulated tumor inhibitors and up-regulated tumor 
facilitators, focusing on pathways potentially involved in the tumorigenesis and 
on putative new drug targets. The data analysis using bioinformatic tools 
revealed: (i) a link between the Shh signaling and the Tis21-dependent 
impairment of the GCPs migration, through a Shh-dependent deregulation of the 
clathrin-mediated chemotaxis operating in the primary cilium through the 
Cxcl3-Cxcr2 axis; (ii) a possible lineage shift of Shh-type GCPs toward retinal 
precursor phenotype, i.e., the neural cell type involved in group 3 MB; (iii) 
the identification of a subset of putative drug targets for MB, involved, among 
the others, in the regulation of Hippo signaling and centrosome assembly. 
Finally, our findings define also the role of Tis21 in the regulation of gene 
expression, through epigenetic and RNA processing mechanisms, influencing the 
fate of the GCPs.

The mechanisms leading to the development and progression of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) are complicated and regulated genetically and epigenetically. 
The recent advancement in high-throughput sequencing has facilitated 
investigations into the role of genetic and epigenetic regulations in 
hepatocarcinogenesis. Therefore, we used systems biology and big database mining 
to construct genetic and epigenetic networks (GENs) using the information about 
mRNA, miRNA, and methylation profiles of HCC patients. Our approach involves 
analyzing gene regulatory networks (GRNs), protein-protein networks (PPINs), and 
epigenetic networks at different stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. The core GENs, 
influencing each stage of HCC, were extracted via principal network projection 
(PNP). The pathways during different stages of HCC were compared. We observed 
that extracellular signals were further transduced to transcription factors 
(TFs), resulting in the aberrant regulation of their target genes, in turn 
inducing mechanisms that are responsible for HCC progression, including cell 
proliferation, anti-apoptosis, aberrant cell cycle, cell survival, and 
metastasis. We also selected potential multiple drugs specific to prominent 
epigenetic network markers of each stage of HCC: lestaurtinib, dinaciclib, and 
perifosine against the NTRK2, MYC, and AKT1 markers influencing HCC progression 
from stage I to stage II; celecoxib, axitinib, and vinblastine against the 
DDIT3, PDGFB, and JUN markers influencing HCC progression from stage II to stage 
III; and atiprimod, celastrol, and bortezomib against STAT3, IL1B, and NFKB1 
markers influencing HCC progression from stage III to stage IV.

Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with no 
effective medical therapies. Investigation into the underlying biology of AS in 
humans is limited by difficulties in obtaining healthy valvular tissue for use 
as a control group. However, micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are stable in 
post-mortem tissue. We compared valve specimens from patients undergoing aortic 
valve replacement for AS to non-diseased cadaveric valves. We found 106 
differentially expressed miRNAs (p < 0.05, adjusted for multiple comparisons) on 
microarray analysis, with highly correlated expression among up- and 
down-regulated miRNAs. Integrated miRNA/gene expression analysis validated the 
microarray results as a whole, while quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
confirmed downregulation of miR-122-5p, miR-625-5p, miR-30e-5p and upregulation 
of miR-21-5p and miR-221-3p. Pathway analysis of the integrated miRNA/mRNA 
network identified pathways predominantly involved in extracellular matrix 
function. A number of currently available therapies target products of 
upregulated genes in the integrated miRNA/mRNA network, with these genes being 
predominantly more peripheral members of the network. The identification of a 
group of tissue miRNA associated with AS may contribute to the development of 
new therapeutic approaches to AS. This study highlights the importance of 
systems biology-based approaches to complex diseases.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, a large number of studies around the world have led 
to the identification of causal genes for hereditary types of common and rare 
neurological and psychiatric disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the functional and genomic features of known human genes 
mutated in neuropsychiatric disorders.
METHODS: A systematic search was used to develop a comprehensive catalog of 
genes mutated in neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD). Functional enrichment and 
protein-protein interaction analyses were carried out. A false discovery rate 
approach was used for correction for multiple testing.
RESULTS: We found several functional categories that are enriched among NPD 
genes, such as gene ontologies, protein domains, tissue expression, signaling 
pathways and regulation by brain-expressed miRNAs and transcription factors. 
Sixty six of those NPD genes are known to be druggable. Several topographic 
parameters of protein-protein interaction networks and the degree of 
conservation between orthologous genes were identified as significant among NPD 
genes.
CONCLUSION: These results represent one of the first analyses of enrichment of 
functional categories of genes known to harbor mutations for NPD. These findings 
could be useful for a future creation of computational tools for prioritization 
of novel candidate genes for NPD.

In model organisms, over 2,000 genes have been shown to modulate aging, the 
collection of which we call the ‘gerontome’. Although some individual 
aging-related genes have been the subject of intense scrutiny, their analysis as 
a whole has been limited. In particular, the genetic interaction of aging and 
age-related pathologies remain a subject of debate. In this work, we perform a 
systematic analysis of the gerontome across species, including human 
aging-related genes. First, by classifying aging-related genes as pro- or 
anti-longevity, we define distinct pathways and genes that modulate aging in 
different ways. Our subsequent comparison of aging-related genes with 
age-related disease genes reveals species-specific effects with strong overlaps 
between aging and age-related diseases in mice, yet surprisingly few overlaps in 
lower model organisms. We discover that genetic links between aging and 
age-related diseases are due to a small fraction of aging-related genes which 
also tend to have a high network connectivity. Other insights from our 
systematic analysis include assessing how using datasets with genes more or less 
studied than average may result in biases, showing that age-related disease 
genes have faster molecular evolution rates and predicting new aging-related 
drugs based on drug-gene interaction data. Overall, this is the largest 
systems-level analysis of the genetics of aging to date and the first to 
discriminate anti- and pro-longevity genes, revealing new insights on 
aging-related genes as a whole and their interactions with age-related diseases.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is among the most common gynecological cancers affecting 
women worldwide. Despite the early detection and rather high overall survival 
rate, around 20% of the cases recur with poor prognosis. The Next Generation 
Sequencing (NGS) technology, also known as massively parallel sequencing, 
symbolizes a high-throughput, fast, sensitive and accurate way to study the 
molecular landscape of a cancer and this has indeed revolutionized endometrial 
cancer research. Understanding the potential, advantages, and limitations of NGS 
will be crucial for the healthcare providers and scientists in providing the 
genome-driven care in this era of precision medicine and pharmacogenomics. This 
mini review aimed to compile and critically summarize the recent findings 
contributed by NGS technology pertaining to EC. Importantly, we also discussed 
the potential of this technology for fundamental discovery research, 
individualized therapy, screening of at-risk individual and early diagnosis.

Patients with metastatic bladder cancer have a median survival of only 13-14 
months. Precision medicine using targeted therapy may improve survival. Here we 
investigated spatial and temporal tumour evolution and tumour heterogeneity in 
order to evaluate the potential use of targeted treatment of metastatic bladder 
cancer. We performed a proof-of-concept study by whole exome sequencing of 
multiple tumour regions (n = 22) from three patients with metastatic bladder 
cancer. DNA from primary and metastatic tumour biopsies was analysed for 
mutations using Mutect and potential therapeutic targets were identified. We 
identified 256, 265 and 378 somatic mutations per patient, encompassing 
mutations with an estimated functional impact in 6-12 known disease driver genes 
per patient. Disease driver mutations present in all tumour regions could be 
identified in all cases, however, over time metastasis specific driver mutations 
emerged. For each patient we identified 6-10 potentially therapeutic targets, 
however very few targets were present in all regions. Low mutational allele 
frequencies were observed in most regions suggesting a complex mixture of 
different cancer cells with no spatial demarcation of subclones. In conclusion, 
primary bladder tumours and metastatic lesions showed heterogeneity at the 
molecular level, but within the primary tumour the heterogeneity appeared low. 
The observed lack of potential therapeutic targets common to all cancer cells in 
primary tumours and metastases emphasizes the challenges in designing rational 
targeted therapy solely based on analysis of the primary tumours.

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease afflicting millions of people of all ages and 
their families worldwide. Tremendous resources have been and continue to be 
devoted to the development of cancer treatments that target the unique mutation 
profiles of patients, namely targeted cancer therapy. However, the sheer volume 
of drugs coupled with cancer heterogeneity becomes a challenge for physicians to 
prescribe effective therapies targeting patients' unique genetic mutations. 
Developing a web service that allows clinicians as well as patients to identify 
effective drug therapies, both approved and experimental, would be helpful for 
both parties. We have developed an innovative web service, IDICAP, which stands 
for Integrated Drug Intervention for CAncer Panel. It uses genes that have been 
linked to a cancer type to search for drug and clinical trial information from 
ClinicalTrials.gov and DrugBank. IDICAP selects and integrates information 
pertaining to clinical trials, disease conditions, drugs under trial, locations 
of trials, drugs that are known to target the queried gene, and any known single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects. We tested IDICAP by gene panels that 
contribute to breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and cancer in general. Clinical 
trials and drugs listed by our tool showed improved precision compared to the 
results from ClinicalTrials.gov and Drug Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb). 
Furthermore, IDICAP provides patients and doctors with a list of clinical 
facilities in their proximity, a characteristic that lends credence to the 
Precision Medicine Initiative launched by the White House in the United States 
in 2015.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, for 
which mainstream treatments have not changed for decades. To identify additional 
therapeutic targets in AML, we optimize a genome-wide clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening platform and use it to 
identify genetic vulnerabilities in AML cells. We identify 492 AML-specific 
cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as 
DOT1L, BCL2, and MEN1, and many other genes including clinically actionable 
candidates. We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological 
inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study. KAT2A 
inhibition demonstrated anti-AML activity by inducing myeloid differentiation 
and apoptosis, and suppressed the growth of primary human AMLs of diverse 
genotypes while sparing normal hemopoietic stem-progenitor cells. Our results 
propose that KAT2A inhibition should be investigated as a therapeutic strategy 
in AML and provide a large number of genetic vulnerabilities of this leukemia 
that can be pursued in downstream studies.

strategy. We constructed a tissue-specific interactome (T2Di) and identified 420 
molecular signatures associated with T2D-related comorbidity and symptoms, 
mainly implicated in inflammation, adipogenesis, protein phosphorylation and 
hormonal secretion. Apart from explaining the residual associations within the 
DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) study, the T2Di 
signatures were enriched in pathogenic cell type-specific regulatory elements 
related to fetal development, immunity and expression quantitative trait loci 
(eQTL). The T2Di revealed a novel locus near a well-established GWAS loci AChE, 
in which SRRT interacts with JAZF1, a T2D-GWAS gene implicated in pancreatic 
function. The T2Di also included known anti-diabetic drug targets (e.g. PPARD, 
MAOB) and identified possible druggable targets (e.g. NCOR2, PDGFR). These T2Di 
signatures were validated by an independent computational method, and by 
expression data of pancreatic islet, muscle and liver with some of the 
signatures (CEBPB, SREBF1, MLST8, SRF, SRRT and SLC12A9) confirmed in PBMC from 
an independent cohort of 66 T2D and 66 control subjects. By combining prior 
knowledge and transcriptome analysis, we have constructed an interactome to 
explain the multi-layered regulatory pathways in T2D.

One way to design a drug is to attempt to phenocopy a genetic variant that is 
known to have the desired effect. In general, drugs that are supported by 
genetic associations progress further in the development pipeline. However, the 
number of associations that are candidates for development into drugs is limited 
because many associations are in non-coding regions or difficult to target 
genes. Approaches that overlay information from pathway databases or biological 
networks can expand the potential target list. In cases where the initial 
variant is not targetable or there is no variant with the desired effect, this 
may reveal new means to target a disease. In this review, we discuss recent 
examples in the domain of pathway and network-based drug repositioning from 
genetic associations. We highlight important caveats and challenges for the 
field, and we discuss opportunities for further development.

Recent studies have demonstrated that cell cycle plays a central role in 
development and carcinogenesis. Thus, the use of big databases and genome-wide 
high-throughput data to unravel the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying 
cell cycle progression in stem cells and cancer cells is a matter of 
considerable interest. Real genetic-and-epigenetic cell cycle networks (GECNs) 
of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and HeLa cancer cells were constructed by 
applying system modeling, system identification, and big database mining to 
genome-wide next-generation sequencing data. Real GECNs were then reduced to 
core GECNs of HeLa cells and ESCs by applying principal genome-wide network 
projection. In this study, we investigated potential carcinogenic and stemness 
mechanisms for systems cancer drug design by identifying common core and 
specific GECNs between HeLa cells and ESCs. Integrating drug database 
information with the specific GECNs of HeLa cells could lead to identification 
of multiple drugs for cervical cancer treatment with minimal side-effects on the 
genes in the common core. We found that dysregulation of miR-29C, miR-34A, 
miR-98, and miR-215; and methylation of ANKRD1, ARID5B, CDCA2, PIF1, STAMBPL1, 
TROAP, ZNF165, and HIST1H2AJ in HeLa cells could result in cell proliferation 
and anti-apoptosis through NFκB, TGF-β, and PI3K pathways. We also identified 3 
drugs, methotrexate, quercetin, and mimosine, which repressed the activated cell 
cycle genes, ARID5B, STK17B, and CCL2, in HeLa cells with minimal side-effects.

Human influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause global pandemics and epidemics. These 
viruses evolve rapidly, making current treatment options ineffective. To 
identify novel modulators of IAV-host interactions, we re-analyzed our recent 
transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and 
genomics/virtual ligand screening data. We identified 713 potential modulators 
targeting 199 cellular and two viral proteins. Anti-influenza activity for 48 of 
them has been reported previously, whereas the antiviral efficacy of the 665 
remains unknown. Studying anti-influenza efficacy and immuno/neuro-modulating 
properties of these compounds and their combinations as well as potential viral 
and host resistance to them may lead to the discovery of novel modulators of 
IAV-host interactions, which might be more effective than the currently 
available anti-influenza therapeutics.

PURPOSE: Male breast cancer is rare, and its genomic landscape has yet to be 
fully characterized. Lacking studies in men, treatment of males with breast 
cancer is extrapolated from results in females with breast cancer. We sought to 
define whether male breast cancers harbor somatic genetic alterations in genes 
frequently altered in female breast cancers.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: All male breast cancers were estrogen receptor-positive, 
and all but two were HER2-negative. Fifty-nine male breast cancers were subtyped 
by immunohistochemistry, and tumor-normal pairs were microdissected and 
subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 241 genes 
frequently mutated in female breast cancers or DNA-repair related. The 
repertoires of somatic mutations and copy number alterations of male breast 
cancers were compared with that of subtype-matched female breast cancers.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent and 71% of male breast cancers were 
immunohistochemically classified as luminal A-like or luminal B-like, 
respectively. Male breast cancers displayed a heterogeneous repertoire of 
somatic genetic alterations that to some extent recapitulated that of estrogen 
receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers, including recurrent 
mutations affecting PIK3CA (20%) and GATA3 (15%). ER-positive/HER2-negative male 
breast cancers, however, less frequently harbored 16q losses, and PIK3CA and 
TP53 mutations than ER-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers. In 
addition, male breast cancers were found to be significantly enriched for 
mutations affecting DNA repair-related genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Male breast cancers less frequently harbor somatic genetic 
alterations typical of ER-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers, such as 
PIK3CA and TP53 mutations and losses of 16q, suggesting that at least a subset 
of male breast cancers are driven by a distinct repertoire of somatic changes. 
Given the genomic differences, caution may be needed in the application of 
biologic and therapeutic findings from studies of female breast cancers to male 
breast cancers. Clin Cancer Res; 22(16); 4045-56. ©2016 AACR.

Nowadays, the personalized approach to health care and cancer care in particular 
is becoming more and more popular and is taking an important place in the 
translational medicine paradigm. In some cases, detection of the 
patient-specific individual mutations that point to a targeted therapy has 
already become a routine practice for clinical oncologists. Wider panels of 
genetic markers are also on the market which cover a greater number of possible 
oncogenes including those with lower reliability of resulting medical 
conclusions. In light of the large availability of high-throughput technologies, 
it is very tempting to use complete patient-specific New Generation Sequencing 
(NGS) or other "omics" data for cancer treatment guidance. However, there are 
still no gold standard methods and protocols to evaluate them. Here we will 
discuss the clinical utility of each of the data types and describe a systems 
biology approach adapted for single patient measurements. We will try to 
summarize the current state of the field focusing on the clinically relevant 
case-studies and practical aspects of data processing.

An emerging therapeutic strategy for cancer is to induce selective lethality in 
a tumor by exploiting interactions between its driving mutations and specific 
drug targets. Here we use a multi-species approach to develop a resource of 
synthetic lethal interactions relevant to cancer therapy. First, we screen in 
yeast ∼169,000 potential interactions among orthologs of human tumor suppressor 
genes (TSG) and genes encoding drug targets across multiple genotoxic 
environments. Guided by the strongest signal, we evaluate thousands of TSG-drug 
combinations in HeLa cells, resulting in networks of conserved synthetic lethal 
interactions. Analysis of these networks reveals that interaction stability 
across environments and shared gene function increase the likelihood of 
observing an interaction in human cancer cells. Using these rules, we prioritize 
∼10(5) human TSG-drug combinations for future follow-up. We validate 
interactions based on cell and/or patient survival, including topoisomerases 
with RAD17 and checkpoint kinases with BLM.

It has been well-recognized that inflammation alongside tissue repair and damage 
maintaining tissue homeostasis determines the initiation and progression of 
complex diseases. Albeit with the accomplishment of having captured the most 
critical inflammation-involved molecules, genetic susceptibilities, epigenetic 
factors, and environmental factors, our schemata on the role of inflammation in 
complex diseases remain largely patchy, in part due to the success of 
reductionism in terms of research methodology per se. Omics data alongside the 
advances in data integration technologies have enabled reconstruction of 
molecular and genetic inflammation networks which shed light on the underlying 
pathophysiology of complex diseases or clinical conditions. Given the proven 
beneficial role of anti-inflammation in coronary heart disease as well as other 
complex diseases and immunotherapy as a revolutionary transition in oncology, it 
becomes timely to review our current understanding of the molecular and genetic 
inflammation networks underlying major human diseases. In this review, we first 
briefly discuss the complexity of infectious diseases and then highlight 
recently uncovered molecular and genetic inflammation networks in other major 
human diseases including obesity, type II diabetes, coronary heart disease, late 
onset Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and sporadic cancer. The 
commonality and specificity of these molecular networks are addressed in the 
context of genetics based on genome-wide association study (GWAS). The 
double-sword role of inflammation, such as how the aberrant type 1 and/or type 2 
immunity leads to chronic and severe clinical conditions, remains open in terms 
of the inflammasome and the core inflammatome network features. Increasingly 
available large Omics and clinical data in tandem with systems biology 
approaches have offered an exciting yet challenging opportunity toward 
reconstruction of more comprehensive and dynamic molecular and genetic 
inflammation networks, which hold great promise in transiting network snapshots 
to video-style multi-scale interplays of disease mechanisms, in turn leading to 
effective clinical intervention.

The genomic events responsible for the pathogenesis of relapsed adult 
B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are not yet clear. We performed integrative 
analysis of whole-genome, whole-exome, custom capture, whole-transcriptome 
(RNA-seq), and locus-specific genomic assays across nine time points from a 
patient with primary de novo B-ALL. Comprehensive genome and transcriptome 
characterization revealed a dramatic tumor evolution during progression, 
yielding a tumor with complex clonal architecture at second relapse. We observed 
and validated point mutations in EP300 and NF1, a highly expressed EP300-ZNF384 
gene fusion, a microdeletion in IKZF1, a focal deletion affecting SETD2, and 
large deletions affecting RB1, PAX5, NF1, and ETV6. Although the genome analysis 
revealed events of potential biological relevance, no clinically actionable 
treatment options were evident at the time of the second relapse. However, 
transcriptome analysis identified aberrant overexpression of the targetable 
protein kinase encoded by the FLT3 gene. Although the patient had refractory 
disease after salvage therapy for the second relapse, treatment with the FLT3 
inhibitor sunitinib rapidly induced a near complete molecular response, 
permitting the patient to proceed to a matched-unrelated donor stem cell 
transplantation. The patient remains in complete remission more than 4 years 
later. Analysis of this patient's relapse genome revealed an unexpected, 
actionable therapeutic target that led to a specific therapy associated with a 
rapid clinical response. For some patients with relapsed or refractory cancers, 
this approach may indicate a novel therapeutic intervention that could alter 
outcome.

INTRODUCTION: Genomic profiling information is frequently available to 
oncologists, enabling targeted cancer therapy. Because clinically relevant 
information is rapidly emerging in the literature and elsewhere, there is a need 
for informatics technologies to support targeted therapies. To this end, we have 
developed a system for Automated Identification of Molecular Effects of Drugs, 
to help biomedical scientists curate this literature to facilitate decision 
support.
OBJECTIVES: To create an automated system to identify assertions in the 
literature concerning drugs targeting genes with therapeutic implications and 
characterize the challenges inherent in automating this process in rapidly 
evolving domains.
METHODS: We used subject-predicate-object triples (semantic predications) and 
co-occurrence relations generated by applying the SemRep Natural Language 
Processing system to MEDLINE abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov descriptions. We 
applied customized semantic queries to find drugs targeting genes of interest. 
The results were manually reviewed by a team of experts.
RESULTS: Compared to a manually curated set of relationships, recall, precision, 
and F2 were 0.39, 0.21, and 0.33, respectively, which represents a 3- to 4-fold 
improvement over a publically available set of predications (SemMedDB) alone. 
Upon review of ostensibly false positive results, 26% were considered relevant 
additions to the reference set, and an additional 61% were considered to be 
relevant for review. Adding co-occurrence data improved results for drugs in 
early development, but not their better-established counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: Precision medicine poses unique challenges for biomedical 
informatics systems that help domain experts find answers to their research 
questions. Further research is required to improve the performance of such 
systems, particularly for drugs in development.

OBJECTIVE: Development of computational approaches and tools to effectively 
integrate multidomain data is urgently needed for the development of newly 
targeted cancer therapeutics.
METHODS: We proposed an integrative network-based infrastructure to identify new 
druggable targets and anticancer indications for existing drugs through 
targeting significantly mutated genes (SMGs) discovered in the human cancer 
genomes. The underlying assumption is that a drug would have a high potential 
for anticancer indication if its up-/down-regulated genes from the Connectivity 
Map tended to be SMGs or their neighbors in the human protein interaction 
network.
RESULTS: We assembled and curated 693 SMGs in 29 cancer types and found 121 
proteins currently targeted by known anticancer or noncancer (repurposed) drugs. 
We found that the approved or experimental cancer drugs could potentially target 
these SMGs in 33.3% of the mutated cancer samples, and this number increased to 
68.0% by drug repositioning through surveying exome-sequencing data in 
approximately 5000 normal-tumor pairs from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Furthermore, 
we identified 284 potential new indications connecting 28 cancer types and 48 
existing drugs (adjusted P < .05), with a 66.7% success rate validated by 
literature data. Several existing drugs (e.g., niclosamide, valproic acid, 
captopril, and resveratrol) were predicted to have potential indications for 
multiple cancer types. Finally, we used integrative analysis to showcase a 
potential mechanism-of-action for resveratrol in breast and lung cancer 
treatment whereby it targets several SMGs (ARNTL, ASPM, CTTN, EIF4G1, FOXP1, and 
STIP1).
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrated that our integrative network-based 
infrastructure is a promising strategy to identify potential druggable targets 
and uncover new indications for existing drugs to speed up molecularly targeted 
cancer therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Transcriptional factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been 
recognized as 2 classes of principal gene regulators that may be responsible for 
genome coexpression changes observed in schizophrenia (SZ).
METHODS: This study aims to (1) identify differentially coexpressed genes (DCGs) 
in 3 mRNA expression microarray datasets; (2) explore potential interactions 
among the DCGs, and differentially expressed miRNAs identified in our dataset 
composed of early-onset SZ patients and healthy controls; (3) validate 
expression levels of some key transcripts; and (4) explore the druggability of 
DCGs using the curated database.
RESULTS: We detected a differential coexpression network associated with SZ and 
found that 9 out of the 12 regulators were replicated in either of the 2 other 
datasets. Leveraging the differentially expressed miRNAs identified in our 
previous dataset, we constructed a miRNA-TF-gene network relevant to SZ, 
including an EGR1-miR-124-3p-SKIL feed-forward loop. Our real-time quantitative 
PCR analysis indicated the overexpression of miR-124-3p, the under expression of 
SKIL and EGR1 in the blood of SZ patients compared with controls, and the 
direction of change of miR-124-3p and SKIL mRNA levels in SZ cases were reversed 
after a 12-week treatment cycle. Our druggability analysis revealed that many of 
these genes have the potential to be drug targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results suggest that coexpression network 
abnormalities driven by combinatorial and interactive action from TFs and miRNAs 
may contribute to the development of SZ and be relevant to the clinical 
treatment of the disease.

The post-genomic era has resulted in the accumulation of high-throughput cancer 
data from a vast array of genomic technologies including next-generation 
sequencing and microarray. As such, the large amounts of germline variant and 
somatic mutation data that have been generated from GWAS and sequencing 
projects, respectively, show great promise in providing a systems-level view of 
these genetic aberrations. In this study, we analyze publicly available GWAS, 
somatic mutation, and drug target data derived from large databanks using a 
network-based approach that incorporates directed edge information under a 
randomized network hypothesis testing procedure. We show that these three 
classes of disease-associated nodes exhibit non-random topological 
characteristics in the context of a functional interactome. Specifically, we 
show that drug targets tend to lie upstream of somatic mutations and disease 
susceptibility germline variants. In addition, we introduce a new approach to 
measuring hierarchy between drug targets, somatic mutants, and disease 
susceptibility genes by utilizing directionality and path length information. 
Overall, our results provide new insight into the intrinsic relationships 
between these node classes that broaden our understanding of cancer. In 
addition, our results align with current knowledge on the therapeutic 
actionability of GWAS and somatic mutant nodes, while demonstrating 
relationships between node classes from a global network perspective.

The incidence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is higher in populations of 
Asian ancestry than European ancestry (EA). We sought to investigate HCC 
mutational differences between the two populations, which may reflect 
differences in the prevalence of etiological factors. We compared HCC somatic 
mutations in patients of self-reported Asian American and EA from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA), and assessed associations of tumor mutations with 
established HCC risk factors. Although the average mutation burden was similar, 
TP53 and RB1 were mutated at a much higher frequency in Asian Americans than in 
EAs (TP53: 43% vs. 21%; RB1: 19% vs. 2%). Three putative oncogenic genes, 
including TRPM3, SAGE1, and ADAMTS7, were mutated exclusively in Asians. In 
addition, VEGF binding pathway, a druggable target by tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
such as sorafenib, was mutated at a higher frequency among Asians (13% vs. 2%); 
while the negative regulation of IL17 production, involved in inflammation and 
autoimmunity, was mutated only in EAs (12% vs. 0). Accounting for HCC risk 
factors had little impact on any of the mutational differences. In conclusion, 
we demonstrated here mutational differences in important cancer genes and 
pathways between Asian and European ancestries. These differences may have 
implications for the prevention and treatment of HCC.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant patterns of DNA methylation are abundant in cancer, and 
epigenetic pathways are increasingly being targeted in cancer drug treatment. 
Genetic components of the folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism pathway can 
affect DNA methylation and other vital cell functions, including DNA synthesis, 
amino acid biosynthesis, and cell growth.
RESULTS: We used a bioinformatics tool, the Transcriptional Pharmacology 
Workbench, to analyze temporal changes in gene expression among epigenetic 
regulators of DNA methylation and demethylation, and one-carbon metabolism genes 
in response to cancer drug treatment. We analyzed gene expression information 
from the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel after treatment with five antitumor 
agents, 5-azacytidine, doxorubicin, vorinostat, paclitaxel, and cisplatin. Each 
antitumor agent elicited concerted changes in gene expression of multiple 
pathway components across the cell lines. Expression changes of FOLR2, SMUG1, 
GART, GADD45A, MBD1, MTR, MTHFD1, and CTH were significantly correlated with 
chemosensitivity to some of the agents. Among many genes with concerted 
expression response to individual antitumor agents were genes encoding DNA 
methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, epigenetic and DNA repair factors 
MGMT, GADD45A, and MBD1, and one-carbon metabolism pathway members MTHFD1, TYMS, 
DHFR, MTR, MAT2A, SLC19A1, ATIC, and GART.
CONCLUSIONS: These transcriptional changes are likely to influence vital 
cellular functions of DNA methylation and demethylation, cellular growth, DNA 
biosynthesis, and DNA repair, and some of them may contribute to cytotoxic and 
apoptotic action of the drugs. This concerted molecular response was observed in 
a time-dependent manner, which may provide future guidelines for temporal 
selection of genetic drug targets for combination drug therapy treatment 
regimens.

Cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) are genes in which inherited mutations confer 
highly or moderately increased risks of developing cancer. Identification of 
these genes and understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie them is 
crucial for the prevention, early diagnosis, and optimized management of cancer. 
Over the past decades, great efforts have been made to identify CPGs through 
multiple strategies. However, information on these CPGs and their molecular 
functions is scattered. To address this issue and provide a comprehensive 
resource for researchers, we developed the Cancer Predisposition Gene Database 
(dbCPG, Database URL: http://bioinfo.ahu.edu.cn:8080/dbCPG/index.jsp), the first 
literature-based gene resource for exploring human CPGs. It contains 827 human 
(724 protein-coding, 23 non-coding, and 80 unknown type genes), 637 rats, and 
658 mouse CPGs. Furthermore, data mining was performed to gain insights into the 
understanding of the CPGs data, including functional annotation, gene 
prioritization, network analysis of prioritized genes and overlap analysis 
across multiple cancer types. A user-friendly web interface with multiple 
browse, search, and upload functions was also developed to facilitate access to 
the latest information on CPGs. Taken together, the dbCPG database provides a 
comprehensive data resource for further studies of cancer predisposition genes.

BACKGROUND: Mixed fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (mFL-HCC) is a rare 
liver tumor defined by the presence of both pure FL-HCC and conventional HCC 
components, represents up to 25% of cases of FL-HCC, and has been associated 
with worse prognosis. Recent genomic characterization of pure FL-HCC identified 
a highly recurrent transcript fusion (DNAJB1:PRKACA) not found in conventional 
HCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed exome and transcriptome sequencing of a case 
of mFL-HCC. A novel BAC-capture approach was developed to identify a 400 kb 
deletion as the underlying genomic mechanism for a DNAJB1:PRKACA fusion in this 
case. A sensitive Nanostring Elements assay was used to screen for this 
transcript fusion in a second case of mFL-HCC, 112 additional HCC samples and 44 
adjacent non-tumor liver samples.
RESULTS: We report the first comprehensive genomic analysis of a case of 
mFL-HCC. No common HCC-associated mutations were identified. The very low 
mutation rate of this case, large number of mostly single-copy, long-range copy 
number variants, and high expression of ERBB2 were more consistent with previous 
reports of pure FL-HCC than conventional HCC. In particular, the DNAJB1:PRKACA 
fusion transcript specifically associated with pure FL-HCC was detected at very 
high expression levels. Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of this fusion 
in all primary and metastatic samples, including those with mixed or 
conventional HCC pathology. A second case of mFL-HCC confirmed our finding that 
the fusion was detectable in conventional components. An expanded screen 
identified a third case of fusion-positive HCC, which upon review, also had both 
conventional and fibrolamellar features. This screen confirmed the absence of 
the fusion in all conventional HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver samples.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that mFL-HCC is similar to pure FL-HCC at the 
genomic level and the DNAJB1:PRKACA fusion can be used as a diagnostic tool for 
both pure and mFL-HCC.

BACKGROUND: The targeting of disease-related proteins is important for drug 
discovery, and yet target-based discovery has not been fruitful. Contextualizing 
overall biological processes is critical to formulating successful drug-disease 
hypotheses. Network pharmacology helps to overcome target-based bottlenecks 
through systems biology analytics, such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
networks and pathway regulation.
RESULTS: We present a systems polypharmacology platform entitled DrugGenEx-Net 
(DGE-NET). DGE-NET predicts empirical drug-target (DT) interactions, integrates 
interaction pairs into a multi-tiered network analysis, and ultimately predicts 
disease-specific drug polypharmacology through systems-based gene expression 
analysis. Incorporation of established biological network annotations for 
protein target-disease, -signaling pathway, -molecular function, and 
protein-protein interactions enhances predicted DT effects on disease 
pathophysiology. Over 50 drug-disease and 100 drug-pathway predictions are 
validated. For example, the predicted systems pharmacology of the 
cholesterol-lowering agent ezetimibe corroborates its potential carcinogenicity. 
When disease-specific gene expression analysis is integrated, DGE-NET 
prioritizes known therapeutics/experimental drugs as well as their 
contra-indications. Proof-of-concept is established for immune-related 
rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as 
neuro-degenerative Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: DGE-NET is a novel computational method that predicting drug 
therapeutic and counter-therapeutic indications by uniquely integrating systems 
pharmacology with gene expression analysis. DGE-NET correctly predicts various 
drug-disease indications by linking the biological activity of drugs and 
diseases at multiple tiers of biological action, and is therefore a useful 
approach to identifying drug candidates for re-purposing.

We report the first combined analysis of whole-genome sequence, detailed 
clinical history, and transcriptome sequence of multiple prostate cancer 
metastases in a single patient (A21). Whole-genome and transcriptome sequence 
was obtained from nine anatomically separate metastases, and targeted DNA 
sequencing was performed in cancerous and noncancerous foci within the primary 
tumor specimen removed 5 yr before death. Transcriptome analysis revealed 
increased expression of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated genes in liver 
metastases that harbored an AR p.L702H mutation, suggesting a dominant effect by 
the mutation despite being present in only one of an estimated 16 copies per 
cell. The metastases harbored several alterations to the PI3K/AKT pathway, 
including a clonal truncal mutation in PIK3CG and present in all metastatic 
sites studied. The list of truncal genomic alterations shared by all metastases 
included homozygous deletion of TP53, hemizygous deletion of RB1 and CHD1, and 
amplification of FGFR1. If the patient were treated today, given this knowledge, 
the use of second-generation androgen-directed therapies, cessation of 
glucocorticoid administration, and therapeutic inhibition of the PI3K/AKT 
pathway or FGFR1 receptor could provide personalized benefit. Three previously 
unreported truncal clonal missense mutations (ABCC4 p.R891L, ALDH9A1 p.W89R, and 
ASNA1 p.P75R) were expressed at the RNA level and assessed as druggable. The 
truncal status of mutations may be critical for effective actionability and 
merit further study. Our findings suggest that a large set of deeply analyzed 
cases could serve as a powerful guide to more effective prostate cancer basic 
science and personalized cancer medicine clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies of coronary artery disease 
(CAD) have revealed 58 genome-wide significant and 148 suggestive genetic loci. 
However, the molecular mechanisms through which they contribute to CAD and the 
clinical implications of these findings remain largely unknown. We aim to 
retrieve gene subnetworks of the 206 CAD loci and identify and prioritize 
candidate regulators to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying 
the genetic associations.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We devised a new integrative genomics approach that 
incorporated (1) candidate genes from the top CAD loci, (2) the complete genetic 
association results from the 1000 genomes-based CAD genome-wide association 
studies from the Coronary Artery Disease Genome Wide Replication and 
Meta-Analysis Plus the Coronary Artery Disease consortium, (3) tissue-specific 
gene regulatory networks that depict the potential relationship and interactions 
between genes, and (4) tissue-specific gene expression patterns between CAD 
patients and controls. The networks and top-ranked regulators according to these 
data-driven criteria were further queried against literature, experimental 
evidence, and drug information to evaluate their disease relevance and potential 
as drug targets. Our analysis uncovered several potential novel regulators of 
CAD such as LUM and STAT3, which possess properties suitable as drug targets. We 
also revealed molecular relations and potential mechanisms through which the top 
CAD loci operate. Furthermore, we found that multiple CAD-relevant biological 
processes such as extracellular matrix, inflammatory and immune pathways, 
complement and coagulation cascades, and lipid metabolism interact in the CAD 
networks.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data-driven integrative genomics framework unraveled 
tissue-specific relations among the candidate genes of the CAD genome-wide 
association studies loci and prioritized novel network regulatory genes 
orchestrating biological processes relevant to CAD.

BACKGROUND: G-DOC Plus is a data integration and bioinformatics platform that 
uses cloud computing and other advanced computational tools to handle a variety 
of biomedical BIG DATA including gene expression arrays, NGS and medical images 
so that they can be analyzed in the full context of other omics and clinical 
information.
RESULTS: G-DOC Plus currently holds data from over 10,000 patients selected from 
private and public resources including Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the recently added datasets from REpository for 
Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa (REMBRANDT), caArray studies of lung and colon 
cancer, ImmPort and the 1000 genomes data sets. The system allows researchers to 
explore clinical-omic data one sample at a time, as a cohort of samples; or at 
the level of population, providing the user with a comprehensive view of the 
data. G-DOC Plus tools have been leveraged in cancer and non-cancer studies for 
hypothesis generation and validation; biomarker discovery and multi-omics 
analysis, to explore somatic mutations and cancer MRI images; as well as for 
training and graduate education in bioinformatics, data and computational 
sciences. Several of these use cases are described in this paper to demonstrate 
its multifaceted usability.
CONCLUSION: G-DOC Plus can be used to support a variety of user groups in 
multiple domains to enable hypothesis generation for precision medicine 
research. The long-term vision of G-DOC Plus is to extend this translational 
bioinformatics platform to stay current with emerging omics technologies and 
analysis methods to continue supporting novel hypothesis generation, analysis 
and validation for integrative biomedical research. By integrating several 
aspects of the disease and exposing various data elements, such as outpatient 
lab workup, pathology, radiology, current treatments, molecular signatures and 
expected outcomes over a web interface, G-DOC Plus will continue to strengthen 
precision medicine research. G-DOC Plus is available at:

Pan-cancer studies are particularly relevant not only for addressing the 
complexity of the inherently observed heterogeneity but also for identifying 
clinically relevant features that may be common to the cancer types. Immune 
system regulations usually reveal synergistic modulation with other cancer 
mechanisms and in combination provide insights on possible advances in cancer 
immunotherapies. Network inference is a powerful approach to decipher pan-cancer 
systems dynamics. The methodology proposed in this study elucidates the impacts 
of epigenetic treatment on the drivers of complex pan-cancer regulation circuits 
involving cell lines of five cancer types. These patterns were observed from 
differential gene expression measurements following demethylation with 
5-azacytidine. Networks were built to establish associations of phenotypes at 
molecular level with cancer hallmarks through both transcriptional and 
post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms. The most prominent feature that 
emerges from our integrative network maps, linking pathway landscapes to disease 
and drug-target associations, refers primarily to a mosaic of immune-system 
crosslinked influences. Therefore, characteristics initially evidenced in single 
cancer maps become motifs well summarized by network cores and fingerprints.

Interpretation of complex cancer genome data, generated by tumor target 
profiling platforms, is key for the success of personalized cancer therapy. How 
to draw therapeutic conclusions from tumor profiling results is not standardized 
and may vary among commercial and academically-affiliated recommendation tools. 
We performed targeted sequencing of 315 genes from 75 metastatic breast cancer 
biopsies using the FoundationOne assay. Results were run through 4 different web 
tools including the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGidb), My Cancer Genome 
(MCG), Personalized Cancer Therapy (PCT), and cBioPortal, for drug and clinical 
trial recommendations. These recommendations were compared amongst each other 
and to those provided by FoundationOne. The identification of a gene as 
targetable varied across the different recommendation sources. Only 33% of cases 
had 4 or more sources recommend the same drug for at least one of the usually 
several altered genes found in tumor biopsies. These results indicate further 
development and standardization of broadly applicable software tools that assist 
in our therapeutic interpretation of genomic data is needed. Existing algorithms 
for data acquisition, integration and interpretation will likely need to 
incorporate artificial intelligence tools to improve both content and real-time 
status.

BACKGROUND: Appendiceal cancer (AC) patients treated with cytoreductive surgery 
(CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) often demonstrate an 
unpredictable variability in their survival outcomes. Biomarkers predictive of 
CRS/HIPEC efficacy could better guide treatment decisions. We hypothesized that 
variation in the transcriptional programming of AC tumors might distinguish 
molecular subtypes with differential outcomes after CRS/HIPEC.
STUDY DESIGN: Gene expression profiles of 2 AC cohorts were analyzed using 
Affymetrix whole-genome expression microarrays. Hierarchical clustering methods, 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression models were used to discover and 
validate prognostic molecular subtypes of AC. Gene set enrichment analysis was 
used to infer pathologic attributes of the molecular subtypes.
RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of tumor expression 
profiles revealed a 139-gene cassette that distinguished 2 molecular subtypes 
(based on low vs high expression of the gene cassette) with statistically 
significant survival differences (disease-specific survival, p = 0.0075; 
progression-free survival, p = 0.0072). In a second AC cohort, the 139-gene 
cassette reproducibly partitioned tumors into subtypes with significant survival 
differences. Tumors showing high relative expression of the genes comprising the 
cassette associated with poor survival outcomes (disease-specific survival, p = 
0.047; progression-free survival, p = 0.0079), and exhibited gene expression 
patterns enriched for oncogenic processes and pathways. The prognostic value of 
the molecular subtypes was specific for low-grade appendiceal tumors 
(disease-specific survival, p = 0.028; progression-free survival, p = 0.0016), 
and remained significant in the presence of conventional prognostic markers, 
including grade, surgical resection score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
status, and age.
CONCLUSIONS: The 139-gene cassette can have actionable clinical utility for 
identifying low-grade appendiceal tumor molecular subtypes predictive of 
therapeutic efficacy of CRS/HIPEC.

The PharmacoGenomic Mutation Database (PGMD) is a comprehensive manually curated 
pharmacogenomics database. Two major sources of PGMD data are peer-reviewed 
literature and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) drug labels. PGMD curators capture information on exact genomic location 
and sequence changes, on resulting phenotype, drugs administered, patient 
population, study design, disease context, statistical significance and other 
properties of reported pharmacogenomic variants. Variants are annotated into 
functional categories on the basis of their influence on pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, efficacy or clinical outcome. The current release of PGMD 
includes over 117 000 unique pharmacogenomic observations, covering all 24 
disease superclasses and nearly 1400 drugs. Over 2800 genes have associated 
pharmacogenomic variants, including genes in proximity to intergenic variants. 
PGMD is optimized for use in annotating next-generation sequencing data by 
providing genomic coordinates for all covered variants, including Single 
Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, haplotypes, diplotypes, 
Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTR), copy number variations and structural 
variations.

The orchestrated action of genes controls complex biological phenotypes, yet the 
systematic discovery of gene and drug combinations that modulate these 
phenotypes in human cells is labor intensive and challenging to scale. Here, we 
created a platform for the massively parallel screening of barcoded 
combinatorial gene perturbations in human cells and translated these hits into 
effective drug combinations. This technology leverages the simplicity of the 
CRISPR-Cas9 system for multiplexed targeting of specific genomic loci and the 
versatility of combinatorial genetics en masse (CombiGEM) to rapidly assemble 
barcoded combinatorial genetic libraries that can be tracked with 
high-throughput sequencing. We applied CombiGEM-CRISPR to create a library of 
23,409 barcoded dual guide-RNA (gRNA) combinations and then perform a 
high-throughput pooled screen to identify gene pairs that inhibited ovarian 
cancer cell growth when they were targeted. We validated the growth-inhibiting 
effects of specific gene sets, including epigenetic regulators KDM4C/BRD4 and 
KDM6B/BRD4, via individual assays with CRISPR-Cas-based knockouts and 
RNA-interference-based knockdowns. We also tested small-molecule drug pairs 
directed against our pairwise hits and showed that they exerted synergistic 
antiproliferative effects against ovarian cancer cells. We envision that the 
CombiGEM-CRISPR platform will be applicable to a broad range of biological 
settings and will accelerate the systematic identification of genetic 
combinations and their translation into novel drug combinations that modulate 
complex human disease phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: Although adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancers are characterized 
by biological features and clinical outcomes distinct from those of other age 
groups, the molecular profile of AYA cancers has not been well defined. In this 
study, we analyzed cancer genomes from rare types of metastatic AYA cancers to 
identify driving and/or druggable genetic alterations.
METHODS: Prospectively collected AYA tumor samples from seven different patients 
were analyzed using three different genomics platforms (whole-exome sequencing, 
whole-transcriptome sequencing or OncoScan™). Using well-known bioinformatics 
tools (bwa, Picard, GATK, MuTect, and Somatic Indel Detector) and our annotation 
approach with open access databases (DAVID and DGIdb), we processed sequencing 
data and identified driving genetic alterations and their druggability.
RESULTS: The mutation frequencies of AYA cancers were lower than those of other 
adult cancers (median = 0.56), except for a germ cell tumor with hypermutation. 
We identified patient-specific genetic alterations in candidate driving genes: 
RASA2 and NF1 (prostate cancer), TP53 and CDKN2C (olfactory neuroblastoma), 
FAT1, NOTCH1, and SMAD4 (head and neck cancer), KRAS (urachal carcinoma), 
EML4-ALK (lung cancer), and MDM2 and PTEN (liposarcoma). We then suggested 
potential drugs for each patient according to his or her altered genes and 
related pathways. By comparing candidate driving genes between AYA cancers and 
those from all age groups for the same type of cancer, we identified different 
driving genes in prostate cancer and a germ cell tumor in AYAs compared with all 
age groups, whereas three common alterations (TP53, FAT1, and NOTCH1) in head 
and neck cancer were identified in both groups.
CONCLUSION: We identified the patient-specific genetic alterations and 
druggability of seven rare types of AYA cancers using three genomics platforms. 
Additionally, genetic alterations in cancers from AYA and those from all age 
groups varied by cancer type.

The development of targeted anti-cancer therapies through the study of cancer 
genomes is intended to increase survival rates and decrease treatment-related 
toxicity. We treated a transposon-driven, functional genomic mouse model of 
medulloblastoma with 'humanized' in vivo therapy (microneurosurgical tumour 
resection followed by multi-fractionated, image-guided radiotherapy). Genetic 
events in recurrent murine medulloblastoma exhibit a very poor overlap with 
those in matched murine diagnostic samples (<5%). Whole-genome sequencing of 33 
pairs of human diagnostic and post-therapy medulloblastomas demonstrated 
substantial genetic divergence of the dominant clone after therapy (<12% 
diagnostic events were retained at recurrence). In both mice and humans, the 
dominant clone at recurrence arose through clonal selection of a pre-existing 
minor clone present at diagnosis. Targeted therapy is unlikely to be effective 
in the absence of the target, therefore our results offer a simple, proximal, 
and remediable explanation for the failure of prior clinical trials of targeted 
therapy.

BACKGROUND: Hemangioma is a common benign tumor in the childhood; however our 
knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of hemangioma development and 
progression are still limited. Currently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown as 
gene expression regulators with an important role in disease pathogenesis. Our 
goals were to identify miRNA-mRNA expression networks associated with infantile 
hemangioma.
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of previously published gene expression 
datasets including 98 hemangioma samples. Deregulated genes were further used to 
identify microRNAs as potential regulators of gene expression in infantile 
hemangioma. Data were integrated using bioinformatics methods, and genes were 
mapped in proteins, which were then used to construct protein-protein 
interaction networks.
RESULTS: Deregulated genes play roles in cell growth and differentiation, cell 
signaling, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Regulatory networks identified 
included microRNAs miR-9, miR-939 and let-7 family; these microRNAs showed the 
most number of interactions with deregulated genes in infantile hemangioma, 
suggesting that they may have an important role in the molecular mechanisms of 
disease. Additionally, results were used to identify drug-gene interactions and 
druggable gene categories using Drug-Gene Interaction Database. We show that 
microRNAs and microRNA-target genes may be useful biomarkers for the development 
of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with infantile hemangioma.
CONCLUSIONS: microRNA-regulated pathways may play a role in infantile hemangioma 
development and progression and may be potentially useful for future development 
of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with infantile hemangioma.

Large-scale genomic studies have identified multiple somatic aberrations in 
breast cancer, including copy number alterations and point mutations. Still, 
identifying causal variants and emergent vulnerabilities that arise as a 
consequence of genetic alterations remain major challenges. We performed 
whole-genome small hairpin RNA (shRNA) "dropout screens" on 77 breast cancer 
cell lines. Using a hierarchical linear regression algorithm to score our screen 
results and integrate them with accompanying detailed genetic and proteomic 
information, we identify vulnerabilities in breast cancer, including candidate 
"drivers," and reveal general functional genomic properties of cancer cells. 
Comparisons of gene essentiality with drug sensitivity data suggest potential 
resistance mechanisms, effects of existing anti-cancer drugs, and opportunities 
for combination therapy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this large 
dataset by identifying BRD4 as a potential target in luminal breast cancer and 
PIK3CA mutations as a resistance determinant for BET-inhibitors.

The Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb, www.dgidb.org) is a web resource that 
consolidates disparate data sources describing drug-gene interactions and gene 
druggability. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface and a documented 
application programming interface (API) for querying these data. DGIdb was 
assembled through an extensive manual curation effort, reflecting the combined 
information of twenty-seven sources. For DGIdb 2.0, substantial updates have 
been made to increase content and improve its usefulness as a resource for 
mining clinically actionable drug targets. Specifically, nine new sources of 
drug-gene interactions have been added, including seven resources specifically 
focused on interactions linked to clinical trials. These additions have more 
than doubled the overall count of drug-gene interactions. The total number of 
druggable gene claims has also increased by 30%. Importantly, a majority of the 
unrestricted, publicly-accessible sources used in DGIdb are now automatically 
updated on a weekly basis, providing the most current information for these 
sources. Finally, a new web view and API have been developed to allow searching 
for interactions by drug identifiers to complement existing gene-based search 
functionality. With these updates, DGIdb represents a comprehensive and user 
friendly tool for mining the druggable genome for precision medicine hypothesis 
generation.

The Network of Cancer Genes (NCG, http://ncg.kcl.ac.uk/) is a manually curated 
repository of cancer genes derived from the scientific literature. Due to the 
increasing amount of cancer genomic data, we have introduced a more robust 
procedure to extract cancer genes from published cancer mutational screenings 
and two curators independently reviewed each publication. NCG release 5.0 
(August 2015) collects 1571 cancer genes from 175 published studies that 
describe 188 mutational screenings of 13 315 cancer samples from 49 cancer types 
and 24 primary sites. In addition to collecting cancer genes, NCG also provides 
information on the experimental validation that supports the role of these genes 
in cancer and annotates their properties (duplicability, evolutionary origin, 
expression profile, function and interactions with proteins and miRNAs).

Epigenetic and microRNA (miRNA) regulation are associated with carcinogenesis 
and the development of cancer. By using the available omics data, including 
those from next-generation sequencing (NGS), genome-wide methylation profiling, 
candidate integrated genetic and epigenetic network (IGEN) analysis, and drug 
response genome-wide microarray analysis, we constructed an IGEN system based on 
three coupling regression models that characterize protein-protein interaction 
networks (PPINs), gene regulatory networks (GRNs), miRNA regulatory networks 
(MRNs), and epigenetic regulatory networks (ERNs). By applying system 
identification method and principal genome-wide network projection (PGNP) to 
IGEN analysis, we identified the core network biomarkers to investigate bladder 
carcinogenic mechanisms and design multiple drug combinations for treating 
bladder cancer with minimal side-effects. The progression of DNA repair and cell 
proliferation in stage 1 bladder cancer ultimately results not only in the 
derepression of miR-200a and miR-200b but also in the regulation of the TNF 
pathway to metastasis-related genes or proteins, cell proliferation, and DNA 
repair in stage 4 bladder cancer. We designed a multiple drug combination 
comprising gefitinib, estradiol, yohimbine, and fulvestrant for treating stage 1 
bladder cancer with minimal side-effects, and another multiple drug combination 
comprising gefitinib, estradiol, chlorpromazine, and LY294002 for treating stage 
4 bladder cancer with minimal side-effects.

The incidence of malignant melanoma continues to increase each year with poor 
prognosis for survival in many relapse cases. To reverse this trend, whole body 
response measures are needed to discover collaborative paths to primary and 
secondary malignancy. Several species of fish provide excellent melanoma models 
because fish and human melanocytes both appear in the epidermis, and fish and 
human pigment cell tumors share conserved gene expression signatures. For the 
first time, we have examined the whole body transcriptome response to invasive 
melanoma as a prelude to using transcriptome profiling to screen for drugs in a 
medaka (Oryzias latipes) model. We generated RNA-seq data from whole body RNA 
isolates for controls and melanoma fish. After testing for differential 
expression, 396 genes had significantly different expression (adjusted p-value 
<0.02) in the whole body transcriptome between melanoma and control fish; 379 of 
these genes were matched to human orthologs with 233 having annotated human gene 
symbols and 14 matched genes that contain putative deleterious variants in human 
melanoma at varying levels of recurrence. A detailed canonical pathway 
evaluation for significant enrichment showed the top scoring pathway to be 
antigen presentation but also included the expected melanocyte development and 
pigmentation signaling pathway. Results revealed a profound down-regulation of 
genes involved in the immune response, especially the innate immune system. We 
hypothesize that the developing melanoma actively suppresses the immune system 
responses of the body in reacting to the invasive malignancy, and that this 
mal-adaptive response contributes to disease progression, a result that suggests 
our whole-body transcriptomic approach merits further use. In these findings, we 
also observed novel genes not yet identified in human melanoma expression 
studies and uncovered known and new candidate drug targets for further testing 
in this malignant melanoma medaka model.

Human cancer cell lines are an important resource for research and drug 
development. However, the available annotations of cell lines are sparse, 
incomplete, and distributed in multiple repositories. Re-analyzing publicly 
available raw RNA-Seq data, we determined the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type 
and abundance, identified expressed viruses and calculated gene expression of 
1,082 cancer cell lines. Using the determined HLA types, public databases of 
cell line mutations, and existing HLA binding prediction algorithms, we 
predicted antigenic mutations in each cell line. We integrated the results into 
a comprehensive knowledgebase. Using the Django web framework, we provide an 
interactive user interface with advanced search capabilities to find and explore 
cell lines and an application programming interface to extract cell line 
information. The portal is available at http://celllines.tron-mainz.de.

MOTIVATION: Several tools exist to identify cancer driver genes based on somatic 
mutation data. However, these tools do not account for subclasses of cancer 
genes: oncogenes, which undergo gain-of-function events, and tumor suppressor 
genes (TSGs) which undergo loss-of-function. A method which accounts for these 
subclasses could improve performance while also suggesting a mechanism of action 
for new putative cancer genes.
RESULTS: We develop a panel of five complementary statistical tests and assess 
their performance against a curated set of 99 HiConf cancer genes using a 
pan-cancer dataset of 1.7 million mutations. We identify patient bias as a novel 
signal for cancer gene discovery, and use it to significantly improve detection 
of oncogenes over existing methods (AUROC = 0.894). Additionally, our test of 
truncation event rate separates oncogenes and TSGs from one another 
(AUROC = 0.922). Finally, a random forest integrating the five tests further 
improves performance and identifies new cancer genes, including CACNG3, HDAC2, 
HIST1H1E, NXF1, GPS2 and HLA-DRB1.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All mutation data, instructions, functions for 
computing the statistics and integrating them, as well as the HiConf gene panel, 
are available at www.github.com/Bose-Lab/Improved-Detection-of-Cancer-Genes.

Metastatic melanoma patients have a poor prognosis, mainly attributable to the 
underlying heterogeneity in melanoma driver genes and altered gene expression 
profiles. These characteristics of melanoma also make the development of drugs 
and identification of novel drug targets for metastatic melanoma a daunting 
task. Systems biology offers an alternative approach to re-explore the genes or 
gene sets that display dysregulated behaviour without being differentially 
expressed. In this study, we have performed systems biology studies to enhance 
our knowledge about the conserved property of disease genes or gene sets among 
mutually exclusive datasets representing melanoma progression. We meta-analysed 
642 microarray samples to generate melanoma reconstructed networks representing 
four different stages of melanoma progression to extract genes with altered 
molecular circuitry wiring as compared to a normal cellular state. Intriguingly, 
a majority of the melanoma network-rewired genes are not differentially 
expressed and the disease genes involved in melanoma progression consistently 
modulate its activity by rewiring network connections. We found that the 
shortlisted disease genes in the study show strong and abnormal network 
connectivity, which enhances with the disease progression. Moreover, the 
deviated network properties of the disease gene sets allow 
ranking/prioritization of different enriched, dysregulated and conserved pathway 
terms in metastatic melanoma, in agreement with previous findings. Our analysis 
also reveals presence of distinct network hubs in different stages of 
metastasizing tumor for the same set of pathways in the statistically conserved 
gene sets. The study results are also presented as a freely available database 
at http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/m3db/. The web-based database resource consists 
of results from the analysis presented here, integrated with cytoscape web and 
user-friendly tools for visualization, retrieval and further analysis.

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a major histo-morphologic type of breast 
cancer. Histological grading (HG) of IDC is widely adopted by oncologists as a 
prognostic factor. However, HG evaluation is highly subjective with only 50%-85% 
inter-observer agreements. Specifically, the subjectivity in the assignment of 
the intermediate grade (histologic grade 2, HG2) breast cancers (comprising ~50% 
of IDC cases) results in uncertain disease outcome prediction and sub-optimal 
systemic therapy. Despite several attempts to identify the mechanisms underlying 
the HG classification, their molecular bases are poorly understood.We performed 
integrative bioinformatics analysis of TCGA and several other cohorts (total 
1246 patients). We identified a 22-gene tumor aggressiveness grading classifier 
(22g-TAG) that reflects global bifurcation in the IDC transcriptomes and 
reclassified patients with HG2 tumors into two genetically and clinically 
distinct subclasses: histological grade 1-like (HG1-like) and histological grade 
3-like (HG3-like). The expression profiles and clinical outcomes of these 
subclasses were similar to the HG1 and HG3 tumors, respectively. We further 
reclassified IDC into low genetic grade (LGG = HG1+HG1-like) and high genetic 
grade (HGG = HG3-like+HG3) subclasses. For the HG1-like and HG3-like IDCs we 
found subclass-specific DNA alterations, somatic mutations, oncogenic pathways, 
cell cycle/mitosis and stem cell-like expression signatures that discriminate 
between these tumors. We found similar molecular patterns in the LGG and HGG 
tumor classes respectively.Our results suggest the existence of two 
genetically-predefined IDC classes, LGG and HGG, driven by distinct oncogenic 
pathways. They provide novel prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers and could 
open unique opportunities for personalized systemic therapies of IDC patients.

Protein-protein interactions are among today's most exciting and promising 
targets for therapeutic intervention. To date, identifying small-molecules that 
selectively disrupt these interactions has proven particularly challenging for 
virtual screening tools, since these have typically been optimized to perform 
well on more "traditional" drug discovery targets. Here, we test the performance 
of the Rosetta energy function for identifying compounds that inhibit protein 
interactions, when these active compounds have been hidden amongst pools of 
"decoys." Through this virtual screening benchmark, we gauge the effect of two 
recent enhancements to the functional form of the Rosetta energy function: the 
new "Talaris" update and the "pwSHO" solvation model. Finally, we conclude by 
developing and validating a new weight set that maximizes Rosetta's ability to 
pick out the active compounds in this test set. Looking collectively over the 
course of these enhancements, we find a marked improvement in Rosetta's ability 
to identify small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.

The Melanoma Gene Database (MGDB) is a manually curated catalog of molecular 
genetic data relating to genes involved in melanoma. The main purpose of this 
database is to establish a network of melanoma related genes and to facilitate 
the mechanistic study of melanoma tumorigenesis. The entries describing the 
relationships between melanoma and genes in the current release were manually 
extracted from PubMed abstracts, which contains cumulative to date 527 human 
melanoma genes (422 protein-coding and 105 non-coding genes). Each melanoma gene 
was annotated in seven different aspects (General Information, Expression, 
Methylation, Mutation, Interaction, Pathway and Drug). In addition, manually 
curated literature references have also been provided to support the inclusion 
of the gene in MGDB and establish its association with melanoma. MGDB has a 
user-friendly web interface with multiple browse and search functions. We hoped 
MGDB will enrich our knowledge about melanoma genetics and serve as a useful 
complement to the existing public resources. Database URL:

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a classical autoimmune liver disease for 
which effective immunomodulatory therapy is lacking. Here we perform 
meta-analyses of discovery data sets from genome-wide association studies of 
European subjects (n=2,764 cases and 10,475 controls) followed by validation 
genotyping in an independent cohort (n=3,716 cases and 4,261 controls). We 
discover and validate six previously unknown risk loci for PBC (Pcombined<5 × 
10(-8)) and used pathway analysis to identify JAK-STAT/IL12/IL27 signalling and 
cytokine-cytokine pathways, for which relevant therapies exist.

Massively parallel sequencing technologies have enabled characterization of 
genomic alterations across multiple tumor types. Efforts have focused on 
identifying driver mutations because they represent potential targets for 
therapy. However, because of the presence of driver and passenger mutations, it 
is often challenging to assign the clinical relevance of specific mutations 
observed in patients. Currently, there are multiple databases and tools that 
provide in silico assessment for potential drivers; however, there is no 
comprehensive resource for mutations with functional characterization. 
Therefore, we created an expert-curated database of potentially actionable 
driver mutations for molecular pathologists to facilitate annotation of cancer 
genomic testing. We reviewed scientific literature to identify variants that 
have been functionally characterized in vitro or in vivo as driver mutations. We 
obtained the chromosome location and all possible nucleotide positions for each 
amino acid change and uploaded them to the Cancer Driver Log (CanDL) database 
with associated literature reference indicating functional driver evidence. In 
addition to a simple interface, the database allows users to download all or 
selected genes as a comma-separated values file for incorporation into their own 
analysis pipeline. Furthermore, the database includes a mechanism for 
third-party contributions to support updates for novel driver mutations. 
Overall, this freely available database will facilitate rapid annotation of 
cancer genomic testing in molecular pathology laboratories for mutations.

Cancer types are commonly classified by histopathology and more recently through 
molecular characteristics such as gene expression, mutations, copy number 
variations, and epigenetic alterations. These molecular characterizations have 
led to the proposal of prognostic biomarkers for many cancer types. 
Nevertheless, most of these biomarkers have been proposed for a specific cancer 
type or even specific subtypes. Although more challenging, it is useful to 
identify biomarkers that can be applied for multiple types of cancer. Here, we 
have used a network-based exploration approach to identify a multi-cancer gene 
expression biomarker highly connected by ESR1, PRKACA, LRP1, JUN and SMAD2 that 
can be predictive of clinical outcome in 12 types of cancer from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository. The gene signature of this biomarker is highly 
supported by cancer literature, biological terms, and prognostic power in other 
cancer types. Additionally, the signature does not seem to be highly associated 
with specific mutations or copy number alterations. Comparisons with cancer-type 
specific and other multi-cancer biomarkers in TCGA and other datasets showed 
that the performance of the proposed multi-cancer biomarker is superior, making 
the proposed approach and multi-cancer biomarker potentially useful in research 
and clinical settings.

In this work, we present the Genome Modeling System (GMS), an analysis 
information management system capable of executing automated genome analysis 
pipelines at a massive scale. The GMS framework provides detailed tracking of 
samples and data coupled with reliable and repeatable analysis pipelines. The 
GMS also serves as a platform for bioinformatics development, allowing a large 
team to collaborate on data analysis, or an individual researcher to leverage 
the work of others effectively within its data management system. Rather than 
separating ad-hoc analysis from rigorous, reproducible pipelines, the GMS 
promotes systematic integration between the two. As a demonstration of the GMS, 
we performed an integrated analysis of whole genome, exome and transcriptome 
sequencing data from a breast cancer cell line (HCC1395) and matched 
lymphoblastoid line (HCC1395BL). These data are available for users to test the 
software, complete tutorials and develop novel GMS pipeline configurations. The 
GMS is available at https://github.com/genome/gms.

The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium-Schizophrenia Workgroup (PGC-SCZ) has 
recently published a genomewide association study (GWAS) identifying >100 
genetic loci, encompassing a total of 341 protein-coding genes, attaining 
genomewide significance for susceptibility to schizophrenia. Given the extremely 
long time (12-15 years) and expense (>$1 billion) associated with the 
development of novel drug targets, repurposing of drugs with known and validated 
targets may be the most expeditious path toward deriving clinical utility from 
these GWAS findings. In the present study, we examined all genes within loci 
implicated by the PGC-SCZ GWAS against databases of targets of both approved and 
registered pharmaceutical compounds. We identified 20 potential schizophrenia 
susceptibility genes that encode proteins that are the targets of approved 
drugs. Of these, we prioritized genes/targets that are of clear neuropsychiatric 
interest and that are also sole members of the linkage disequilibrium block 
surrounding a PGC-SCZ GWAS hit. In addition to DRD2, 5 genes meet these 
criteria: CACNA1C, CACNB2, CACNA1I, GRIN2A and HCN1. An additional 20 genes 
coding for proteins that are the targets of drugs in registered clinical trials, 
but without approved indications, were also identified. Although considerable 
work is still required to fully explicate the biological implications of the 
PGC-SCZ GWAS results, pathways related to these known, druggable targets may 
represent a promising starting point.

In the last few years, mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets have 
become an integral part of everyday life, due to their software/hardware rapid 
development, as well as the increased portability they offer. Nevertheless, up 
to now, only few Apps have been developed in the field of bioinformatics, 
capable to perform fast and robust access to services. We have developed the 
GeneStoryTeller, a mobile application for Android platforms, where users are 
able to instantly retrieve information regarding any recorded human gene, 
derived from eight publicly available databases, as a summary story. 
Complementary information regarding gene-drugs interactions, functional 
annotation and disease associations for each selected gene is also provided in 
the gene story. The most challenging part during the development of the 
GeneStoryTeller was to keep balance between storing data locally within the app 
and obtaining the updated content dynamically via a network connection. This was 
accomplished with the implementation of an administrative site where data are 
curated and synchronized with the application requiring a minimum human 
intervention.

Progress in DNA sequencing has revealed the startling complexity of cancer 
genomes, which typically carry thousands of somatic mutations. However, it 
remains unclear which are the key driver mutations or dependencies in a given 
cancer and how these influence pathogenesis and response to therapy. Although 
tumors of similar types and clinical outcomes can have patterns of mutations 
that are strikingly different, it is becoming apparent that these mutations 
recurrently hijack the same hallmark molecular pathways and networks. For this 
reason, it is likely that successful interpretation of cancer genomes will 
require comprehensive knowledge of the molecular networks under selective 
pressure in oncogenesis. Here we announce the creation of a new effort, The 
Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI), aimed at systematically detailing these 
complex interactions among cancer genes and how they differ between diseased and 
healthy states. We discuss recent progress that enables creation of these cancer 
cell maps across a range of tumor types and how they can be used to target 
networks disrupted in individual patients, significantly accelerating the 
development of precision medicine.

Objective. Bringing together genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other 
-omics technologies is an important step towards developing highly personalized 
medicine. However, instrumentation has advances far beyond expectations and now 
we are able to generate data faster than it can be interpreted. Materials and 
Methods. We have developed PANDA (Pathway AND Annotation) Explorer, a 
visualization tool that integrates gene-level annotation in the context of 
biological pathways to help interpret complex data from disparate sources. PANDA 
is a web-based application that displays data in the context of well-studied 
pathways like KEGG, BioCarta, and PharmGKB. PANDA represents data/annotations as 
icons in the graph while maintaining the other data elements (i.e., other 
columns for the table of annotations). Custom pathways from underrepresented 
diseases can be imported when existing data sources are inadequate. PANDA also 
allows sharing annotations among collaborators. Results. In our first use case, 
we show how easy it is to view supplemental data from a manuscript in the 
context of a user's own data. Another use-case is provided describing how PANDA 
was leveraged to design a treatment strategy from the somatic variants found in 
the tumor of a patient with metastatic sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma. 
Conclusion. PANDA facilitates the interpretation of gene-centric annotations by 
visually integrating this information with context of biological pathways. The 
application can be downloaded or used directly from our website:

Heterogeneous drug data representation among different druggable genome 
knowledge resources and datasets delays effective cancer therapeutic target 
discovery within the broad scientific community. The objective of the present 
paper is to describe the challenges and lessons learned from our efforts in 
developing and evaluating a standards-based drug normalization framework 
targeting cancer druggable genome datasets. Our findings suggested that 
mechanisms need to be established to deal with spelling errors and 
irregularities in normalizing clinical drug data in The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA), whereas the annotations from NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) and PubChem are two 
layers of normalization that potentially bridge between the clinical phenotypes 
and the druggable genome knowledge for effective cancer therapeutic target 
discovery.

In this study, we analyzed the prevalence and clone size of BRAF V600E mutation 
in 209 patients with multiple myeloma and related the results to clinical 
phenotype, response and survival. Biopsies were screened for BRAF V600E by 
allele-specific real-time PCR (AS-PCR). Positive results were confirmed by 
immunohistochemistry, Sanger sequencing and, in three patients from whom we had 
stored purified myeloma cells, whole-exome sequencing. Eleven patients (5.3%) 
were BRAF V600E mutation positive by AS-PCR and at least one other method. The 
fraction of mutated cells varied from 4 to 100%. BRAF V600E-positive patients 
had no characteristic clinical phenotype except for significantly higher levels 
of serum creatinine (125 versus 86 μmol/l) Seven of eleven patients responded 
with at least very good partial response to alkylators, immunomodulatory agents 
or proteasome inhibitors. Progression-free and overall survival were similar in 
patients with and without the mutation. By this integrated approach, we found 
that patients with BRAF V600E mutation responded very well to broad acting drugs 
and there was no relation to prognosis in early-stage myeloma. In particular, a 
large mutated cell fraction did not correlate with aggressive disease.

We describe open, reproducible pipelines that create an integrated genomic 
profile of a cancer and use the profile to find mutations associated with 
disease and potentially useful drugs. These pipelines analyze high-throughput 
cancer exome and transcriptome sequence data together with public databases to 
find relevant mutations and drugs. The three pipelines that we have developed 
are: (1) an exome analysis pipeline, which uses whole or targeted tumor exome 
sequence data to produce a list of putative variants (no matched normal data are 
needed); (2) a transcriptome analysis pipeline that processes whole tumor 
transcriptome sequence (RNA-seq) data to compute gene expression and find 
potential gene fusions; and (3) an integrated variant analysis pipeline that 
uses the tumor variants from the exome pipeline and tumor gene expression from 
the transcriptome pipeline to identify deleterious and druggable mutations in 
all genes and in highly expressed genes. These pipelines are integrated into the 
popular Web platform Galaxy at http://usegalaxy.org/cancer to make them 
accessible and reproducible, thereby providing an approach for doing 
standardized, distributed analyses in clinical studies. We have used our 
pipeline to identify similarities and differences between pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines and primary tumors.

BACKGROUND: The extent to which metastatic tumors further evolve by accumulating 
additional mutations is unclear and has yet to be addressed extensively using 
next-generation sequencing of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.
METHODS: Eleven spatially separated tumor samples from the primary tumor and 
associated metastatic sites and two normal samples were obtained from a Stage 
IIIC ovarian cancer patient during cytoreductive surgery prior to chemotherapy. 
Whole exome sequencing and copy number analysis were performed. Omental exomes 
were sequenced with a high depth of coverage to thoroughly explore the variants 
in metastatic lesions. Somatic mutations were further validated by ultra-deep 
targeted sequencing to sort out false positives and false negatives. Based on 
the somatic mutations and copy number variation profiles, a phylogenetic tree 
was generated to explore the evolutionary relationship among tumor samples.
RESULTS: Only 6% of the somatic mutations were present in every sample of a 
given case with TP53 as the only known mutant gene consistently present in all 
samples. Two non-spatial clusters of primary tumors (cluster P1 and P2), and a 
cluster of metastatic regions (cluster M) were identified. The patterns of 
mutations indicate that cluster P1 and P2 diverged in the early phase of 
tumorigenesis, and that metastatic cluster M originated from the common 
ancestral clone of cluster P1 with few somatic mutations and copy number 
variations.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a high level of intratumor heterogeneity was evident in 
high-grade serous ovarian cancer, our results suggest that transcoelomic 
metastasis arises with little accumulation of somatic mutations and copy number 
alterations in this patient.

The burden that Parkinson's disease (PD) exacts on the population continues to 
increase year after year. Though refinement of symptomatic treatments continues 
at a reasonable pace, no accepted therapies are available to slow or prevent 
disease progression. The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene was 
identified in PD genetic studies and offers new hope for novel therapeutic 
approaches. The evidence linking LRRK2 kinase activity to PD susceptibility is 
presented, as well as seminal discoveries relevant to the prosecution of LRRK2 
kinase inhibition. Finally, suggestions are made for predictive preclinical 
modeling and successful first-in-human trials.

Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly heterogeneous disease. To identify potential 
clinically actionable therapeutic targets that may inform individualized 
treatment strategies, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 78 GCs of differing 
histologies and anatomic locations, as well as whole-genome sequencing on two GC 
cases, each with three primary tumors and two matching lymph node metastases. 
The data showed two distinct GC subtypes with either high-clonality (HiC) or 
low-clonality (LoC). The HiC subtype of intratumoral heterogeneity was 
associated with older age, TP53 (tumor protein P53) mutation, enriched C > G 
transition, and significantly shorter survival, whereas the LoC subtype was 
associated with younger age, ARID1A (AT rich interactive domain 1A) mutation, 
and significantly longer survival. Phylogenetic tree analysis of whole-genome 
sequencing data from multiple samples of two patients supported the clonal 
evolution of GC metastasis and revealed the accumulation of genetic defects that 
necessitate combination therapeutics. The most recurrently mutated genes, which 
were validated in a separate cohort of 216 cases by targeted sequencing, were 
members of the homologous recombination DNA repair, Wnt, and PI3K-ERBB pathways. 
Notably, the drugable NRG1 (neuregulin-1) and ERBB4 (V-Erb-B2 avian 
erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4) ligand-receptor pair were 
mutated in 10% of GC cases. Mutations of the BRCA2 (breast cancer 2, early 
onset) gene, found in 8% of our cohort and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas 
GC cohort, were associated with significantly longer survivals. These data 
define distinct clinicogenetic forms of GC in the Chinese population that are 
characterized by specific mutation sets that can be investigated for efficacy of 
single and combination therapies.

We describe here RepurposeVS for the reliable prediction of drug-target 
signatures using X-ray protein crystal structures. RepurposeVS is a virtual 
screening method that incorporates docking, drug-centric and protein-centric 
2D/3D fingerprints with a rigorous mathematical normalization procedure to 
account for the variability in units and provide high-resolution contextual 
information for drug-target binding. Validity was confirmed by the following: 
(1) providing the greatest enrichment of known drug binders for multiple protein 
targets in virtual screening experiments, (2) determining that similarly shaped 
protein target pockets are predicted to bind drugs of similar 3D shapes when 
RepurposeVS is applied to 2,335 human protein targets, and (3) determining true 
biological associations in vitro for mebendazole (MBZ) across many predicted 
kinase targets for potential cancer repurposing. Since RepurposeVS is a drug 
repurposing-focused method, benchmarking was conducted on a set of 3,671 FDA 
approved and experimental drugs rather than the Database of Useful Decoys (DUDE) 
so as to streamline downstream repurposing experiments. We further apply 
RepurposeVS to explore the overall potential drug repurposing space for 
currently approved drugs. RepurposeVS is not computationally intensive and 
increases performance accuracy, thus serving as an efficient and powerful in 
silico tool to predict drug-target associations in drug repurposing.

A weighted and integrated drug-target interactome: drug repurposing for 
schizophrenia as a use case.

Huang LC, Soysal E, Zheng W, Zhao Z, Xu H, Sun J.

BACKGROUND: Computational pharmacology can uniquely address some issues in the 
process of drug development by providing a macroscopic view and a deeper 
understanding of drug action. Specifically, network-assisted approach is 
promising for the inference of drug repurposing. However, the drug-target 
associations coming from different sources and various assays have much noise, 
leading to an inflation of the inference errors. To reduce the inference errors, 
it is necessary and critical to create a comprehensive and weighted data set of 
drug-target associations.
RESULTS: In this study, we created a weighted and integrated drug-target 
interactome (WinDTome) to provide a comprehensive resource of drug-target 
associations for computational pharmacology. We first collected drug-target 
interactions from six commonly used drug-target centered data sources including 
DrugBank, KEGG, TTD, MATADOR, PDSP K(i) Database, and BindingDB. Then, we 
employed the record linkage method to normalize drugs and targets to the unique 
identifiers by utilizing the public data sources including PubChem, Entrez Gene, 
and UniProt. To assess the reliability of the drug-target associations, we 
assigned two scores (Score_S and Score_R) to each drug-target association based 
on their data sources and publication references. Consequently, the WinDTome 
contains 546,196 drug-target associations among 303,018 compounds and 4,113 
genes. To assess the application of the WinDTome, we designed a network-based 
approach for drug repurposing using mental disorder schizophrenia (SCZ) as a 
case. Starting from 41 known SCZ drugs and their targets, we inferred a total of 
264 potential SCZ drugs through the associations of drug-target with Score_S 
higher than two in WinDTome and human protein-protein interactions. Among the 
264 SCZ-related drugs, 39 drugs have been investigated in clinical trials for 
SCZ treatment and 74 drugs for the treatment of other mental disorders, 
respectively. Compared with the results using other Score_S cutoff values, 
single data source, or the data from STITCH, the inference of 264 SCZ-related 
drugs had the highest performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The WinDTome generated in this study contains comprehensive 
drug-target associations with confidence scores. Its application to the SCZ drug 
repurposing demonstrated that the WinDTome is promising to serve as a useful 
resource for drug repurposing.

Altered protein phosphorylation is a feature of many human cancers that can be 
targeted therapeutically. Phosphopeptide enrichment is a critical step for 
maximizing the depth of phosphoproteome coverage by MS, but remains challenging 
for tissue specimens because of their high complexity. We describe the first 
analysis of a tissue phosphoproteome using polymer-based metal ion affinity 
capture (PolyMAC), a nanopolymer that has excellent yield and specificity for 
phosphopeptide enrichment, on a transgenic mouse model of HER2-driven breast 
cancer. By combining phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation with PolyMAC, 411 
unique peptides with 139 phosphotyrosine, 45 phosphoserine, and 29 
phosphothreonine sites were identified from five LC-MS/MS runs. Combining 
reverse phase liquid chromatography fractionation at pH 8.0 with PolyMAC 
identified 1571 unique peptides with 1279 phosphoserine, 213 phosphothreonine, 
and 21 phosphotyrosine sites from eight LC-MS/MS runs. Linear motif analysis 
indicated that many of the phosphosites correspond to well-known phosphorylation 
motifs. Analysis of the tyrosine phosphoproteome with the Drug Gene Interaction 
database uncovered a network of potential therapeutic targets centered on Src 
family kinases with inhibitors that are either FDA-approved or in clinical 
development. These results demonstrate that PolyMAC is well suited for 
phosphoproteomic analysis of tissue specimens.

The current therapeutic arsenal against viral infections remains limited, with 
often poor efficacy and incomplete coverage, and appears inadequate to face the 
emergence of drug resistance. Our understanding of viral biology and 
pathophysiology and our ability to develop a more effective antiviral arsenal 
would greatly benefit from a more comprehensive picture of the events that lead 
to viral replication and associated symptoms. Towards this goal, the 
construction of virus-host interactomes is instrumental, mainly relying on the 
assumption that a viral infection at the cellular level can be viewed as a 
number of perturbations introduced into the host protein network when viral 
proteins make new connections and disrupt existing ones. Here, we review 
advances in interactomic approaches for viral infections, focusing on 
high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies and on the generation of 
high-quality datasets. We show how these are already beginning to offer 
intriguing perspectives in terms of virus-host cell biology and the control of 
cellular functions, and we conclude by offering a summary of the current 
situation regarding the potential development of host-oriented antiviral 
therapeutics.

Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a disease that affects many high-altitude 
dwellers, particularly in the Andean Mountains in South America. The hallmark 
symptom of CMS is polycythemia, which causes increased risk of pulmonary 
hypertension and stroke (among other symptoms). A prevailing hypothesis in 
high-altitude medicine is that CMS results from a population-specific 
"maladaptation" to the hypoxic conditions at high altitude. In contrast, the 
prevalence of CMS is very low in other high-altitude populations (e.g., Tibetans 
and Ethiopians), which are seemingly well adapted to hypoxia. In recent years, 
concurrent with the advent of genomic technologies, several studies have 
investigated the genetic basis of adaptation to altitude. These studies have 
identified several candidate genes that may underlie the adaptation, or 
maladaptation. Interestingly, some of these genes are targeted by known drugs, 
raising the possibility of new treatments for CMS and other ischemic diseases. 
We review recent discoveries, alongside the methodologies used to obtain them, 
and outline some of the challenges remaining in the field.

We carried out a mutational analysis of 3,594 genes coding for cell surface 
proteins (Surfaceome) in 23 colorectal cancer cell lines, searching for new 
altered pathways, druggable mutations and mutated epitopes for targeted therapy 
in colorectal cancer. A total of 3,944 somatic non-synonymous substitutions and 
595 InDels, occurring in 2,061 (57%) Surfaceome genes were catalogued. We 
identified 48 genes not previously described as mutated in colorectal tumors in 
the TCGA database, including genes that are mutated and expressed in >10% of the 
cell lines (SEMA4C, FGFRL1, PKD1, FAM38A, WDR81, TMEM136, SLC36A1, SLC26A6, 
IGFLR1). Analysis of these genes uncovered important roles for FGF and SEMA4 
signaling in colorectal cancer with possible therapeutic implications. We also 
found that cell lines express on average 11 druggable mutations, including 
frequent mutations (>20%) in the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL and EPHA2, which 
have not been previously considered as potential targets for colorectal cancer. 
Finally, we identified 82 cell surface mutated epitopes, however expression of 
only 30% of these epitopes was detected in our cell lines. Notwithstanding, 92% 
of these epitopes were expressed in cell lines with the mutator phenotype, 
opening new venues for the use of "general" immune checkpoint drugs in this 
subset of patients.

We present the 'dnet' package and apply it to the 'TCGA' mutation and clinical 
data of >3,000 patients. We uncover the existence of an underlying gene network 
that at least partially controls cancer 'survivalness', with mutations that are 
significantly correlated with patient survival, yet independent of tumour origin 
and type. The survivalness network has natural community structure corresponding 
to tumour hallmarks, and contains genes that are potentially druggable in the 
clinic. This network has evolutionary roots in Deuterostomia identifying PTK2 
and VAV1 as under-valued relative to more studied genes from that era. The 
'dnet' R package is available at http://cran.r-project.org/package=dnet.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a survey of recent progress in the use of large-scale 
biologic data to impact clinical care, and the impact the reuse of electronic 
health record data has made in genomic discovery.
METHOD: Survey of key themes in translational bioinformatics, primarily from 
2012 and 2013.
RESULT: This survey focuses on four major themes: the growing use of Electronic 
Health Records (EHRs) as a source for genomic discovery, adoption of genomics 
and pharmacogenomics in clinical practice, the possible use of genomic 
technologies for drug repurposing, and the use of personal genomics to guide 
care.
CONCLUSION: Reuse of abundant clinical data for research is speeding discovery, 
and implementation of genomic data into clinical medicine is impacting care with 
new classes of data rarely used previously in medicine.

The sensitivity of massively-parallel sequencing has confirmed that most cancers 
are oligoclonal, with subpopulations of neoplastic cells harboring distinct 
mutations. A fine resolution view of this clonal architecture provides insight 
into tumor heterogeneity, evolution, and treatment response, all of which may 
have clinical implications. Single tumor analysis already contributes to 
understanding these phenomena. However, cryptic subclones are frequently 
revealed by additional patient samples (e.g., collected at relapse or following 
treatment), indicating that accurately characterizing a tumor requires analyzing 
multiple samples from the same patient. To address this need, we present 
SciClone, a computational method that identifies the number and genetic 
composition of subclones by analyzing the variant allele frequencies of somatic 
mutations. We use it to detect subclones in acute myeloid leukemia and breast 
cancer samples that, though present at disease onset, are not evident from a 
single primary tumor sample. By doing so, we can track tumor evolution and 
identify the spatial origins of cells resisting therapy.

Of hundreds to thousands of somatic mutations that exist in each cancer genome, 
a large number are unique and non-recurrent variants. Prioritizing genetic 
variants identified via next generation sequencing technologies remains a major 
challenge. Many such variants occur in tumor genes that have well-established 
biological and clinical relevance and are putative targets of molecular therapy, 
however, most variants are still of unknown significance. With large amounts of 
data being generated as high throughput sequencing assays enter the clinical 
realm, there is a growing need to better communicate relevant findings in a 
timely manner while remaining cognizant of the potential consequences of misuse 
or overinterpretation of genomic information. Herein we describe a systematic 
framework for variant annotation and prioritization, and we propose a structured 
molecular pathology report using standardized terminology in order to best 
inform oncology clinical practice. We hope that our experience developing a 
comprehensive knowledge database of emerging predictive markers matched to 
targeted therapies will help other institutions implement similar programs.

DNA sequencing technology advances have enabled genetic investigation of more 
samples in a shorter time than has previously been possible. Furthermore, the 
ability to analyze and understand large sequencing datasets has improved due to 
concurrent advances in sequence data analysis methods and software tools. 
Constant improvements to both technology and analytic approaches in this fast 
moving field are evidenced by many recent publications of computational methods, 
as well as biological results linking genetic events to human disease. Cancer in 
particular has been the subject of intense investigation, owing to the genetic 
underpinnings of this complex collection of diseases. New massively-parallel 
sequencing (MPS) technologies have enabled the investigation of thousands of 
samples, divided across tens of different tumor types, resulting in new driver 
gene identification, mutagenic pattern characterization, and other newly 
uncovered features of tumor biology. This review will focus both on methods and 
recent results: current analytical approaches to DNA and RNA sequencing will be 
presented followed by a review of recent pan-cancer sequencing studies. This 
overview of methods and results will not only highlight the recent advances in 
cancer genomics, but also the methods and tools used to accomplish these 
advancements in a constantly and rapidly improving field.

The area of plant and animal genomics covers the entire suite of issues in 
biology because it aims to determine the structure and function of genetic 
material. Although specific issues define research advances at an organism 
level, it is evident that many of the fundamental features of genome structure 
and the translation of encoded information to function share common ground. The 
Plant and Animal Genome (PAG) conference held in San Diego (California), in 
January each year provides an overview across all organisms at the genome level, 
and often it is evident that investments in the human area provide leadership, 
applications, and discoveries for researchers studying other organisms. This 
mini-review utilizes the plenary lectures as a basis for summarizing the trends 
in the genome-level studies of organisms, and the lectures include presentations 
by Ewan Birney (EBI, UK), Eric Green (NIH, USA), John Butler (NIST, USA), Elaine 
Mardis (Washington, USA), Caroline Dean (John Innes Centre, UK), Trudy Mackay 
(NC State University, USA), Sue Wessler (UC Riverside, USA), and Patrick Wincker 
(Genoscope, France). The work reviewed is based on published papers. Where 
unpublished information is cited, permission to include the information in this

The immune system is a highly complex and dynamic system. Historically, the most 
common scientific and clinical practice has been to evaluate its individual 
components. This kind of approach cannot always expose the interconnecting 
pathways that control immune-system responses and does not reveal how the immune 
system works across multiple biological systems and scales. High-throughput 
technologies can be used to measure thousands of parameters of the immune system 
at a genome-wide scale. These system-wide surveys yield massive amounts of 
quantitative data that provide a means to monitor and probe immune-system 
function. New integrative analyses can help synthesize and transform these data 
into valuable biological insight. Here we review some of the computational 
analysis tools for high-dimensional data and how they can be applied to 
immunology.

Massively parallel DNA and RNA sequencing approaches have generated data on 
thousands of breast cancer genomes. In this review, we consider progress largely 
from the perspective of new concepts and hypotheses raised so far. These include 
challenges to the multistep model of breast carcinogenesis and the discovery of 
new defects in DNA repair through sequence analysis. Issues for functional 
genomics include the development of strategies to differentiate between 
mutations that are likely to drive carcinogenesis and bystander background 
mutations, as well as the importance of mechanistic studies that examine the 
role of mutations in genes with roles in splicing, histone methylation, and long 
non-coding RNA function. The application of genome-annotated patient-derived 
breast cancer xenografts as a potentially more reliable preclinical model is 
also discussed. Finally, we address the challenge of extracting medical value 
from genomic data. A weakness of many datasets is inadequate clinical 
annotation, which hampers the establishment of links between the mutation 
spectra and the efficacy of drugs or disease phenotypes. Tools such as dGene and 
the DGIdb are being developed to identify possible druggable mutations, but 
these programs are a work in progress since extensive molecular pharmacology is 
required to develop successful ‘genome-forward’ clinical trials. Examples are 
emerging, however, including targeting HER2 in HER2 mutant breast cancer and 
mutant ESR1 in ESR1 endocrine refractory luminal-type breast cancer. Finally, 
the integration of DNA- and RNA-based sequencing studies with mass 
spectrometry-based peptide sequencing and an unbiased determination of 
post-translational modifications promises a more complete view of the 
biochemistry of breast cancer cells and points toward a new discovery horizon in 
our understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex disease.

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods are rapidly providing remarkable 
advances in our ability to study the molecular profiles of human cancers. 
However, the scientific discovery offered by NGS also includes challenges 
concerning the interpretation of large and non-trivial experimental results. 
This task is potentially further complicated when a multitude of molecular 
profiling modalities are available, with the goal of a more integrative and 
comprehensive analysis of the cancer biology.

Revealing the inherent heterogeneity of human malignancies by variant consensus 
strategies coupled with cancer clonal analysis.

Peterson EA, Chavan SS, Bauer MA, Heuck CJ, Johann DJ.

Tumors are heterogeneous in composition. They are composed of cancer cells 
proper, along with stromal elements that collectively form a microenvironment, 
all of which are necessary to nurture the malignant process. In addition, many 
of the stromal cells are modified to support the unique needs of the malignant 
state. Tumors are composed of a variety of clones or subpopulations of cancer 
cells, which may differ in karyotype, growth rate, expression of cell surface 
markers, sensitivity to therapeutics, etc. New tools and methods to provide an 
improved understanding of tumor clonal architecture are needed to guide therapy.

Whole genome sequencing has enabled the identification of thousands of somatic 
mutations within non-coding genomic regions of individual cancer samples. 
However, identification of mutations that potentially alter gene regulation 
remains a major challenge. Here we present OncoCis, a new method that enables 
identification of potential cis-regulatory mutations using cell type-specific 
genome and epigenome-wide datasets along with matching gene expression data. We 
demonstrate that the use of cell type-specific information and gene expression 
can significantly reduce the number of candidate cis-regulatory mutations 
compared with existing tools designed for the annotation of cis-regulatory SNPs.

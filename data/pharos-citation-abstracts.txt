The discovery of novel therapeutic targets, defined as proteins which drugs can 
interact with to induce therapeutic benefits, typically represent the first and 
most important step of drug discovery. One solution for target discovery is 
target repositioning, a strategy which relies on the repurposing of known 
targets for new diseases, leading to new treatments, less side effects and 
potential drug synergies. Biological networks have emerged as powerful tools for 
integrating heterogeneous data and facilitating the prediction of biological or 
therapeutic properties. Consequently, they are widely employed to predict new 
therapeutic targets by characterizing potential candidates, often based on their 
interactions within a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, and their 
proximity to genes associated with the disease. However, over-reliance on PPI 
networks and the assumption that potential targets are necessarily near known 
genes can introduce biases that may limit the effectiveness of these methods. 
This study addresses these limitations in two ways. First, by exploiting a 
multi-layer network which incorporates additional information such as gene 
regulation, metabolite interactions, metabolic pathways, and several disease 
signatures such as Differentially Expressed Genes, mutated genes, Copy Number 
Alteration, and structural variants. Second, by extracting relevant features 
from the network using several approaches including proximity to 
disease-associated genes, but also unbiased approaches such as propagation-based 
methods, topological metrics, and module detection algorithms. Using prostate 
cancer as a case study, the best features were identified and utilized to train 
machine learning algorithms to predict 5 novel promising therapeutic targets for 
prostate cancer: IGF2R, C5AR, RAB7, SETD2 and NPBWR1.

Many research groups and institutions have created a variety of databases 
curating experimental and predicted data related to protein-ligand binding. The 
landscape of available databases is dynamic, with new databases emerging and 
established databases becoming defunct. Here, we review the current state of 
databases that contain binding pockets and protein-ligand binding interactions. 
We have compiled a list of such databases, fifty-three of which are currently 
available for use. We discuss variation in how binding pockets are defined and 
summarize pocket-finding methods. We organize the fifty-three databases into 
subgroups based on goals and contents, and describe standard use cases. We also 
illustrate that pockets within the same protein are characterized differently 
across different databases. Finally, we assess critical issues of 
sustainability, accessibility and redundancy.

Drug repurposing is an attractive strategy for therapy development, particularly 
in rare diseases where traditional drug development approaches may be 
challenging owing to high cost and small numbers of patients. In this study, we 
used a drug identification and repurposing pipeline to identify candidate 
targetable drivers of disease and corresponding therapies through application of 
causal reasoning using a combination of open-access resources and 
transcriptomics data. We optimized our approach on psoriasis as a disease model, 
demonstrating the ability to identify known and, to date, unrecognized molecular 
drivers of psoriasis and link them to current and emerging therapies. 
Application of our approach to a cohort of tissue samples of necrobiosis 
lipoidica (an unrelated; rare; and, to date, molecularly poorly characterized 
cutaneous inflammatory disorder) identified a unique set of upstream regulators, 
particularly highlighting the role of IFNG and the Jak-signal transducer and 
activator of transcription pathway as a likely driver of disease pathogenesis 
and linked it to Jak inhibitors as potential therapy. Analysis of an independent 
cohort of necrobiosis lipoidica samples validated these findings, with the 
overall agreement of drug-matched upstream regulators above 96%. These data 
highlight the utility of our approach in rare diseases and offer an opportunity 
for drug discovery in other rare diseases in dermatology and beyond.

Protein kinases are critical components of a myriad biological processes and 
strongly associated with various diseases. While kinase research has been a 
point of focus in biomedical research for several decades, a large portion of 
the kinome is still considered understudied or "dark," because prior research is 
targeted towards a subset of kinases with well-established roles in cellular 
processes. We present an empirical and in-silico hybrid workflow to extend the 
functional knowledge of understudied kinases. Utilizing multiplex peptide 
activity arrays and robust in-silico analyses, we extended the functional 
knowledge of five dark tyrosine kinases (AATK, EPHA6, INSRR, LTK, TNK1) and 
explored their roles in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's dementia (AD), and major 
depressive disorder (MDD). Using this hybrid approach, we identified 195 novel 
kinase-substrate interactions with variable degrees of affinity and linked 
extended functional networks for these kinases to biological processes that are 
impaired in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Biochemical assays and mass 
spectrometry were used to confirm a putative substrate of EPHA6, an understudied 
dark tyrosine kinase. We examined the EPHA6 network and knowledgebase in 
schizophrenia using reporter peptides identified and validated from the 
multi-plex array with high affinity for phosphorylation by EPHA6. Identification 
and confirmation of putative substrates for understudied kinases provides a 
wealth of actionable information for the development of new drug treatments as 
well as exploration of the pathophysiology of disease states using signaling 
network approaches.

Differences between orbital and subcutaneous abdominal fat in the same patient 
have been noted but not formally investigated, previously. The objective of this 
research was to compare the differential expression of protein profiles in 
subcutaneous abdominal and orbital adipose tissues. In this cross-sectional, 
observational study, orbital fat tissue was sampled from 10 patients who 
underwent blepharoplasty and agreed to provide a small sample of subcutaneous 
abdominal fat. Shotgun mass spectrometry was performed on the extracted 
proteome. Data were analyzed using protein appearance patterns, differential 
expression and statistical enrichment. Protein analysis revealed significant 
differences in proteomics and differential expression between the orbital and 
subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissues, which presented five proteins that were 
uniquely expressed in the orbital fat and 18 in the subcutaneous abdominal fat. 
Gene Ontology analysis identified significantly different cellular processes and 
components related to the extracellular matrix or basement membrane components. 
This analysis shows the differences between orbital and subcutaneous abdominal 
fat found in proteomics differential expression, uniquely expressed proteins, 
and cellular processes. Further research is needed to correlate specific 
proteins and cellular processes to the mechanism of fat accumulation and 
obesity.

Opioid misuse, addiction, and associated overdose deaths remain global public 
health crises. Despite the tremendous need for pharmacological treatments, 
current options are limited in number, use, and effectiveness. Fundamental leaps 
forward in our understanding of the biology driving opioid addiction are needed 
to guide development of more effective medication-assisted therapies. This 
Review focuses on the omics-identified biological features associated with 
opioid addiction. Recent GWAS have begun to identify robust genetic 
associations, including variants in OPRM1, FURIN, and the gene cluster 
SCAI/PPP6C/RABEPK. An increasing number of omics studies of postmortem human 
brain tissue examining biological features (e.g., histone modification and gene 
expression) across different brain regions have identified broad gene 
dysregulation associated with overdose death among opioid misusers. Drawn 
together by meta-analysis and multi-omic systems biology, and informed by model 
organism studies, key biological pathways enriched for opioid 
addiction-associated genes are emerging, which include specific receptors (e.g., 
GABAB receptors, GPCR, and Trk) linked to signaling pathways (e.g., Trk, 
ERK/MAPK, orexin) that are associated with synaptic plasticity and neuronal 
signaling. Studies leveraging the agnostic discovery power of omics and placing 
it within the context of functional neurobiology will propel us toward 
much-needed, field-changing breakthroughs, including identification of 
actionable targets for drug development to treat this devastating brain disease.

BACKGROUND: Clinical biomarkers, allow better classification of patients 
according to their disease risk, prognosis, and/or response to treatment. 
Although affordable omics-based approaches have paved the way for quicker 
identification of putative biomarkers, validation of biomarkers is necessary for 
translation of discoveries into clinical application.
OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, in this study, we emphasize the potential of in silico 
approaches and have proposed and applied 3 novel sequential in silico 
pre-clinical validation steps to better identify the biomarkers that are truly 
desirable for clinical investment.
DESIGN: As protein biomarkers are becoming increasingly important in the clinic 
alongside other molecular biomarkers and lung cancer is the most common cause of 
cancer-related deaths, we used protein biomarkers for lung cancer as an 
illustrative example to apply our in silico pre-clinical validation approach.
METHODS: We collected the reported protein biomarkers for 3 cases (lung 
adenocarcinoma-LUAD, squamous cell carcinoma-LUSC, and unspecified lung cancer) 
and evaluated whether the protein biomarkers have cancer altering properties 
(i.e., act as tumor suppressors or oncoproteins and represent cancer hallmarks), 
are expressed in body fluids, and can be targeted by FDA-approved drugs.
RESULTS: We collected 3008 protein biomarkers for lung cancer, 1189 for LUAD, 
and 182 for LUSC. Of these protein biomarkers for lung cancer, LUAD, and LUSC, 
only 28, 25, and 6 protein biomarkers passed the 3 in silico pre-clinical 
validation steps examined, and of these, only 5 and 2 biomarkers were specific 
for lung cancer and LUAD, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we applied our in silico pre-clinical validation 
approach the protein biomarkers for lung cancer cases. However, this approach 
can be applied and adapted to all cancer biomarkers. We believe that this 
approach will greatly facilitate the transition of cancer biomarkers into the 
clinical phase and offers great potential for future biomarker research.

Plain Language Summary: Biomarkers, which are routinely used in clinics, allow 
better classification of patients according to their disease risk, prognosis, 
and/or response to treatment. Although affordable omics-based approaches have 
paved the way for quicker identification of putative biomarkers, validation of 
biomarkers is necessary for translation of discoveries into clinical 
application. This research article highlights the challenges of translating 
cancer biomarkers into clinical practice and summarizes feasible step toward “in 
silico pre-clinical validation” using the example of lung cancer types. 
Accordingly, protein biomarkers proposed for lung cancer are being investigated 
using the “in silico pre-clinical validation” approach to determine whether they 
have cancer altering properties (i.e., oncoprotein, tumor suppressor, and cancer 
hallmark), are expressed in body fluids (i.e., plasma/serum, saliva, urine, and 
bronchoalveolar lavage) and can be targeted with FDA-approved drugs. We believe 
that the step of in silico pre-clinical validation is the future of biomarker 
research for all professionals involved in clinical, biological, 
epidemiological, biostatistical and health research, and that it will greatly 
facilitate the transition of biomarkers to the clinical phase.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) are 
foundational resources in cancer research, providing extensive molecular and 
phenotypic data. However, large-scale proteomic data across various cancer types 
for these cohorts remain limited. Here, we expand upon our previous work to 
generate high-quality protein expression data for approximately 8,000 TCGA 
patient samples and around 900 CCLE cell line samples, covering 447 clinically 
relevant proteins, using reverse-phase protein arrays. These protein expression 
profiles offer profound insights into intertumor heterogeneity and cancer 
dependency and serve as sensitive functional readouts for somatic alterations. 
We develop a systematic protein-centered strategy for identifying synthetic 
lethality pairs and experimentally validate an interaction between protein 
kinase A subunit α and epidermal growth factor receptor. We also identify 
metastasis-related protein markers with clinical relevance. This dataset 
represents a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of cancer 
mechanisms, discovering protein biomarkers and developing innovative therapeutic 
strategies.

Druggable pockets are protein regions that have the ability to bind organic 
small molecules, and their characterization is essential in target-based drug 
discovery. However, deriving pocket descriptors is challenging and existing 
strategies are often limited in applicability. We introduce PocketVec, an 
approach to generate pocket descriptors via inverse virtual screening of 
lead-like molecules. PocketVec performs comparably to leading methodologies 
while addressing key limitations. Additionally, we systematically search for 
druggable pockets in the human proteome, using experimentally determined 
structures and AlphaFold2 models, identifying over 32,000 binding sites across 
20,000 protein domains. We then generate PocketVec descriptors for each site and 
conduct an extensive similarity search, exploring over 1.2 billion pairwise 
comparisons. Our results reveal druggable pocket similarities not detected by 
structure- or sequence-based methods, uncovering clusters of similar pockets in 
proteins lacking crystallized inhibitors and opening the door to strategies for 
prioritizing chemical probe development to explore the druggable space.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of complex traits is essential for 
developing targeted interventions. We analyzed liver expression 
quantitative-trait locus (eQTL) meta-analysis data on 1,183 participants to 
identify conditionally distinct signals. We found 9,013 eQTL signals for 6,564 
genes; 23% of eGenes had two signals, and 6% had three or more signals. We then 
integrated the eQTL results with data from 29 cardiometabolic genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) traits and identified 1,582 GWAS-eQTL colocalizations 
for 747 eGenes. Non-primary eQTL signals accounted for 17% of all 
colocalizations. Isolating signals by conditional analysis prior to coloc 
resulted in 37% more colocalizations than using marginal eQTL and GWAS data, 
highlighting the importance of signal isolation. Isolating signals also led to 
stronger evidence of colocalization: among 343 eQTL-GWAS signal pairs in 
multi-signal regions, analyses that isolated the signals of interest resulted in 
higher posterior probability of colocalization for 41% of tests. Leveraging 
allelic heterogeneity, we predicted causal effects of gene expression on liver 
traits for four genes. To predict functional variants and regulatory elements, 
we colocalized eQTL with liver chromatin accessibility QTL (caQTL) and found 391 
colocalizations, including 73 with non-primary eQTL signals and 60 eQTL signals 
that colocalized with both a caQTL and a GWAS signal. Finally, we used publicly 
available massively parallel reporter assays in HepG2 to highlight 14 eQTL 
signals that include at least one expression-modulating variant. This 
multi-faceted approach to unraveling the genetic underpinnings of liver-related 
traits could lead to therapeutic development.

Whole genome and exome sequencing are reporting on hundreds of thousands of 
missense mutations. Taking a pan-disease approach, we explored how mutations in 
intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) break or generate protein interactions 
mediated by short linear motifs. We created a peptide-phage display library 
tiling ~57,000 peptides from the IDRs of the human proteome overlapping 12,301 
single nucleotide variants associated with diverse phenotypes including cancer, 
metabolic diseases and neurological diseases. By screening 80 human proteins, we 
identified 366 mutation-modulated interactions, with half of the mutations 
diminishing binding, and half enhancing binding or creating novel interaction 
interfaces. The effects of the mutations were confirmed by affinity 
measurements. In cellular assays, the effects of motif-disruptive mutations were 
validated, including loss of a nuclear localisation signal in the cell division 
control protein CDC45 by a mutation associated with Meier-Gorlin syndrome. The 
study provides insights into how disease-associated mutations may perturb and 
rewire the motif-based interactome.

The categorization of human diseases is mainly based on the affected organ 
system and phenotypic characteristics. This is limiting the view to the 
pathological manifestations, while it neglects mechanistic relationships that 
are crucial to develop therapeutic strategies. This work aims to advance the 
understanding of diseases and their relatedness beyond traditional phenotypic 
views. Hence, the similarity among 502 diseases is mapped using six different 
data dimensions encompassing molecular, clinical, and pharmacological 
information retrieved from public sources. Multiple distance measures and 
multi-view clustering are used to assess the patterns of disease relatedness. 
The integration of all six dimensions into a consensus map of disease 
relationships reveals a divergent disease view from the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD), emphasizing novel insights offered by a 
multi-view disease map. Disease features such as genes, pathways, and chemicals 
that are enriched in distinct disease groups are identified. Finally, an 
evaluation of the top similar diseases of three candidate diseases common in the 
Western population shows concordance with known epidemiological associations and 
reveals rare features shared between Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's 
disease. A revision of disease relationships holds promise for facilitating the 
reconstruction of comorbidity patterns, repurposing drugs, and advancing drug 
discovery in the future.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found in primary and 
advanced tumours. They are primarily involved in tumour progression through 
complex mechanisms with other types of cells in the tumour microenvironment. 
However, essential fibroblasts-related genes (FRG) in bladder cancer still need 
to be explored, and there is a shortage of an ideal predictive model or 
molecular subtype for the progression and immune therapeutic assessment for 
bladder cancer, especially muscular-invasive bladder cancer based on the FRG.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAF-related genes of bladder cancer were identified by 
analysing single-cell RNA sequence datasets, and bulk transcriptome datasets and 
gene signatures were used to characterize them. Then, 10 types of machine 
learning algorithms were utilised to determine the hallmark FRG and construct 
the FRG index (FRGI) and subtypes. Further molecular subtypes combined with CD8+ 
T-cells were established to predict the prognosis and immune therapy response.
RESULTS: Fifty-four BLCA-related FRG were screened by large-scale scRNA-sequence 
datasets. The machine learning algorithm established a 3-genes FRGI. High FRGI 
represented a worse outcome. Then, FRGI combined clinical variables to construct 
a nomogram, which shows high predictive performance for the prognosis of bladder 
cancer. Furthermore, the BLCA datasets were separated into two subtypes - 
fibroblast hot and cold types. In five independent BLCA cohorts, the fibroblast 
hot type showed worse outcomes than the cold type. Multiple cancer-related 
hallmark pathways are distinctively enriched in these two types. In addition, 
high FRGI or fibroblast hot type shows a worse immune therapeutic response. 
Then, four subtypes called CD8-FRG subtypes were established under the 
combination of FRG signature and activity of CD8+ T-cells, which turned out to 
be effective in predicting the prognosis and immune therapeutic response of 
bladder cancer in multiple independent datasets. Pathway enrichment analysis, 
multiple gene signatures, and epigenetic alteration characterize the CD8-FRG 
subtypes and provide a potential combination strategy method against bladder 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the authors established a novel FRGI and CD8-FRG 
subtype by large-scale datasets and organised analyses, which could accurately 
predict clinical outcomes and immune therapeutic response of BLCA after surgery.

The chromatin-associated protein WDR5 has been widely studied due to its role in 
histone modification and its potential as a pharmacological target for the 
treatment of cancer. In humans, the protein with highest sequence homology to 
WDR5 is encoded by the retrogene WDR5B, which remains unexplored. Here, we used 
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to generate WDR5B knockout and WDR5B-FLAG knock-in 
cell lines for further characterization. In contrast to WDR5, WDR5B exhibits low 
expression in pluripotent cells and is upregulated upon neural differentiation. 
Loss or shRNA depletion of WDR5B impairs cell growth and increases the fraction 
of non-viable cells in proliferating retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cultures. 
CUT&RUN chromatin profiling in RPE and neural progenitors indicates minimal 
WDR5B enrichment at established WDR5 binding sites. These results suggest that 
WDR5 and WDR5B exhibit several divergent biological properties despite sharing a 
high degree of sequence homology.

With over 450 genes, solute carriers (SLCs) constitute the largest transporter 
superfamily responsible for the uptake and efflux of nutrients, metabolites, and 
xenobiotics in human cells. SLCs are associated with a wide variety of human 
diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and metabolic and neurological disorders. 
They represent an important therapeutic target class that remains only partly 
exploited as therapeutics that target SLCs are scarce. Additionally, many small 
molecules reported in the literature to target SLCs are poorly characterized. 
Both features may be due to the difficulty of developing SLC transport assays 
that fulfill the quality criteria for high-throughput screening. Here, we report 
one of the main limitations hampering assay development within the RESOLUTE 
consortium: the lack of a resource providing high-quality information on SLC 
tool compounds. To address this, we provide a systematic annotation of tool 
compounds targeting SLCs. We first provide an overview on RESOLUTE assays. Next, 
we present a list of SLC-targeting compounds collected from the literature and 
public databases; we found that most data sources lacked specificity data. 
Finally, we report on experimental tests of 19 selected compounds against a 
panel of 13 SLCs from seven different families. Except for a few inhibitors, 
which were active on unrelated SLCs, the tested inhibitors demonstrated high 
selectivity for their reported targets. To make this knowledge easily accessible 
to the scientific community, we created an interactive dashboard displaying the 
collected data in the RESOLUTE web portal (https://re-solute.eu). We anticipate 
that our open-access resources on assays and compounds will support the 
development of future drug discovery campaigns for SLCs.

Explaining predictions for drug repositioning with biological knowledge graphs 
is a challenging problem. Graph completion methods using symbolic reasoning 
predict drug treatments and associated rules to generate evidence representing 
the therapeutic basis of the drug. Yet the vast amounts of generated paths that 
are biologically irrelevant or not mechanistically meaningful within the context 
of disease biology can limit utility. We use a reinforcement learning based 
knowledge graph completion model combined with an automatic filtering approach 
that produces the most relevant rules and biological paths explaining the 
predicted drug's therapeutic connection to the disease. In this work we validate 
the approach against preclinical experimental data for Fragile X syndrome 
demonstrating strong correlation between automatically extracted paths and 
experimentally derived transcriptional changes of selected genes and pathways of 
drug predictions Sulindac and Ibudilast. Additionally, we show it reduces the 
number of generated paths in two case studies, 85% for Cystic fibrosis and 95% 
for Parkinson's disease.

Drug discovery is costly and time consuming, and modern drug discovery endeavors 
are progressively reliant on computational methodologies, aiming to mitigate 
temporal and financial expenditures associated with the process. In particular, 
the time required for vaccine and drug discovery is prolonged during emergency 
situations such as the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. Recently, the performance of 
deep learning methods in drug virtual screening has been particularly prominent. 
It has become a concern for researchers how to summarize the existing deep 
learning in drug virtual screening, select different models for different drug 
screening problems, exploit the advantages of deep learning models, and further 
improve the capability of deep learning in drug virtual screening. This review 
first introduces the basic concepts of drug virtual screening, common datasets, 
and data representation methods. Then, large numbers of common deep learning 
methods for drug virtual screening are compared and analyzed. In addition, a 
dataset of different sizes is constructed independently to evaluate the 
performance of each deep learning model for the difficult problem of large-scale 
ligand virtual screening. Finally, the existing challenges and future directions 
in the field of virtual screening are presented.

TIN-X (Target Importance and Novelty eXplorer) is an interactive visualization 
tool for illuminating associations between diseases and potential drug targets 
and is publicly available at newdrugtargets.org. TIN-X uses natural language 
processing to identify disease and protein mentions within PubMed content using 
previously published tools for named entity recognition (NER) of gene/protein 
and disease names. Target data is obtained from the Target Central Resource 
Database (TCRD). Two important metrics, novelty and importance, are computed 
from this data and when plotted as log(importance) vs. log(novelty), aid the 
user in visually exploring the novelty of drug targets and their associated 
importance to diseases. TIN-X Version 3.0 has been significantly improved with 
an expanded dataset, modernized architecture including a REST API, and an 
improved user interface (UI). The dataset has been expanded to include not only 
PubMed publication titles and abstracts, but also full-text articles when 
available. This results in approximately 9-fold more target/disease associations 
compared to previous versions of TIN-X. Additionally, the TIN-X database 
containing this expanded dataset is now hosted in the cloud via Amazon RDS. 
Recent enhancements to the UI focuses on making it more intuitive for users to 
find diseases or drug targets of interest while providing a new, sortable 
table-view mode to accompany the existing plot-view mode. UI improvements also 
help the user browse the associated PubMed publications to explore and 
understand the basis of TIN-X's predicted association between a specific disease 
and a target of interest. While implementing these upgrades, computational 
resources are balanced between the webserver and the user's web browser to 
achieve adequate performance while accommodating the expanded dataset. Together, 
these advances aim to extend the duration that users can benefit from TIN-X 
while providing both an expanded dataset and new features that researchers can 
use to better illuminate understudied proteins.

Depression is a prevalent mental disorder with a complex biological mechanism. 
Following the rapid development of systems biology technology, a growing number 
of studies have applied proteomics and metabolomics to explore the molecular 
profiles of depression. However, a standardized resource facilitating the 
identification and annotation of the available knowledge from these scattered 
studies associated with depression is currently lacking. This study presents 
ProMENDA, an upgraded resource that provides a platform for manual annotation of 
candidate proteins and metabolites linked to depression. Following the 
establishment of the protein dataset and the update of the metabolite dataset, 
the ProMENDA database was developed as a major extension of its initial release. 
A multi-faceted annotation scheme was employed to provide comprehensive 
knowledge of the molecules and studies. A new web interface was also developed 
to improve the user experience. The ProMENDA database now contains 43,366 
molecular entries, comprising 20,847 protein entries and 22,519 metabolite 
entries, which were manually curated from 1370 human, rat, mouse, and non-human 
primate studies. This represents a significant increase (more than 7-fold) in 
molecular entries compared to the initial release. To demonstrate the usage of 
ProMENDA, a case study identifying consistently reported proteins and 
metabolites in the brains of animal models of depression was presented. Overall, 
ProMENDA is a comprehensive resource that offers a panoramic view of proteomic 
and metabolomic knowledge in depression. ProMENDA is freely available at 
https://menda.cqmu.edu.cn .

BACKGROUND: Rare oncogenic driver events, particularly affecting the expression 
or splicing of driver genes, are suspected to substantially contribute to the 
large heterogeneity of hematologic malignancies. However, their identification 
remains challenging.
METHODS: To address this issue, we generated the largest dataset to date of 
matched whole genome sequencing and total RNA sequencing of hematologic 
malignancies from 3760 patients spanning 24 disease entities. Taking advantage 
of our dataset size, we focused on discovering rare regulatory aberrations. 
Therefore, we called expression and splicing outliers using an extension of the 
workflow DROP (Detection of RNA Outliers Pipeline) and AbSplice, a variant 
effect predictor that identifies genetic variants causing aberrant splicing. We 
next trained a machine learning model integrating these results to prioritize 
new candidate disease-specific driver genes.
RESULTS: We found a median of seven expression outlier genes, two splicing 
outlier genes, and two rare splice-affecting variants per sample. Each category 
showed significant enrichment for already well-characterized driver genes, with 
odds ratios exceeding three among genes called in more than five samples. On 
held-out data, our integrative modeling significantly outperformed modeling 
based solely on genomic data and revealed promising novel candidate driver 
genes. Remarkably, we found a truncated form of the low density lipoprotein 
receptor LRP1B transcript to be aberrantly overexpressed in about half of hairy 
cell leukemia variant (HCL-V) samples and, to a lesser extent, in closely 
related B-cell neoplasms. This observation, which was confirmed in an 
independent cohort, suggests LRP1B as a novel marker for a HCL-V subclass and a 
yet unreported functional role of LRP1B within these rare entities.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our census of expression and splicing outliers for 24 
hematologic malignancy entities and the companion computational workflow 
constitute unique resources to deepen our understanding of rare oncogenic events 
in hematologic cancers.

Polypharmacology drugs-compounds that inhibit multiple proteins-have many 
applications but are difficult to design. To address this challenge we have 
developed POLYGON, an approach to polypharmacology based on generative 
reinforcement learning. POLYGON embeds chemical space and iteratively samples it 
to generate new molecular structures; these are rewarded by the predicted 
ability to inhibit each of two protein targets and by drug-likeness and 
ease-of-synthesis. In binding data for >100,000 compounds, POLYGON correctly 
recognizes polypharmacology interactions with 82.5% accuracy. We subsequently 
generate de-novo compounds targeting ten pairs of proteins with documented 
co-dependency. Docking analysis indicates that top structures bind their two 
targets with low free energies and similar 3D orientations to canonical 
single-protein inhibitors. We synthesize 32 compounds targeting MEK1 and mTOR, 
with most yielding >50% reduction in each protein activity and in cell viability 
when dosed at 1-10 μM. These results support the potential of generative 
modeling for polypharmacology.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetics are characterized by lower 
discoverability than most other psychiatric disorders. The contribution to 
biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We 
performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies 
across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 
admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases). We 
identified 95 genome-wide significant loci (80 new). Convergent multi-omic 
approaches identified 43 potential causal genes, broadly classified as 
neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic modulators (for example, GRIA1, GRM8 
and CACNA1E), developmental, axon guidance and transcription factors (for 
example, FOXP2, EFNA5 and DCC), synaptic structure and function genes (for 
example, PCLO, NCAM1 and PDE4B) and endocrine or immune regulators (for example, 
ESR1, TRAF3 and TANK). Additional top genes influence stress, immune, fear and 
threat-related processes, previously hypothesized to underlie PTSD neurobiology. 
These findings strengthen our understanding of neurobiological systems relevant 
to PTSD pathophysiology, while also opening new areas for investigation.

The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) consortium generated reagents, 
biological model systems, data, informatic databases, and computational tools. 
The Resource Dissemination and Outreach Center (RDOC) played a central 
administrative role, organized internal meetings, fostered collaboration, and 
coordinated consortium-wide efforts. The RDOC developed and deployed a Resource 
Management System (RMS) to enable efficient workflows for collecting, accessing, 
validating, registering, and publishing resource metadata. IDG policies for 
repositories and standardized representations of resources were established, 
adopting the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles. 
The RDOC also developed metrics of IDG impact. Outreach initiatives included 
digital content, the Protein Illumination Timeline (representing milestones in 
generating data and reagents), the Target Watch publication series, the e-IDG 
Symposium series, and leveraging social media platforms.

Identification of druggable proteins can greatly reduce the cost of discovering 
new potential drugs. Traditional experimental approaches to exploring these 
proteins are often costly, slow, and labor-intensive, making them impractical 
for large-scale research. In response, recent decades have seen a rise in 
computational methods. These alternatives support drug discovery by creating 
advanced predictive models. In this study, we proposed a fast and precise 
classifier for the identification of druggable proteins using a protein language 
model (PLM) with fine-tuned evolutionary scale modeling 2 (ESM-2) embeddings, 
achieving 95.11% accuracy on the benchmark dataset. Furthermore, we made a 
careful comparison to examine the predictive abilities of ESM-2 embeddings and 
position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) features by using the same classifiers. 
The results suggest that ESM-2 embeddings outperformed PSSM features in terms of 
accuracy and efficiency. Recognizing the potential of language models, we also 
developed an end-to-end model based on the generative pre-trained transformers 2 
(GPT-2) with modifications. To our knowledge, this is the first time a large 
language model (LLM) GPT-2 has been deployed for the recognition of druggable 
proteins. Additionally, a more up-to-date dataset, known as Pharos, was adopted 
to further validate the performance of the proposed model.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and incurable neurodegenerative 
disease caused by the selective and progressive death of motor neurons (MNs). 
Understanding the genetic and molecular factors influencing ALS survival is 
crucial for disease management and therapeutics. In this study, we introduce a 
deep learning-powered genetic analysis framework to link rare noncoding genetic 
variants to ALS survival. Using data from human induced pluripotent stem cell 
(iPSC)-derived MNs, this method prioritizes functional noncoding variants using 
deep learning, links cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to target genes using 
epigenomics data, and integrates these data through gene-level burden tests to 
identify survival-modifying variants, CREs, and genes. We apply this approach to 
analyze 6,715 ALS genomes, and pinpoint four novel rare noncoding variants 
associated with survival, including chr7:76,009,472:C>T linked to CCDC146. 
CRISPR-Cas9 editing of this variant increases CCDC146 expression in iPSC-derived 
MNs and exacerbates ALS-specific phenotypes, including TDP-43 mislocalization. 
Suppressing CCDC146 with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), showing no 
toxicity, completely rescues ALS-associated survival defects in neurons derived 
from sporadic ALS patients and from carriers of the ALS-associated G4C2-repeat 
expansion within C9ORF72. ASO targeting of CCDC146 may be a broadly effective 
therapeutic approach for ALS. Our framework provides a generic and powerful 
approach for studying noncoding genetics of complex human diseases.

Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are a class of activity-regulated genes (ARGs) that 
are transiently and rapidly activated in the absence of de novo protein 
synthesis in response to neuronal activity. We explored the role of IEGs in 
genetic networks to pinpoint potential drug targets for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Using a combination of network analysis and genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) summary statistics we show that (1) IEGs exert greater topological 
influence across different human and mouse gene networks compared to other ARGs, 
(2) ARGs are sparsely involved in diseases and significantly more mutational 
constrained compared to non-ARGs, (3) Many AD-linked variants are in ARGs gene 
regions, mainly in MARK4 near FOSB, with an AD risk eQTL that increases MARK4 
expression in cortical areas, (4) MARK4 holds an influential place in a dense AD 
multi-omic network and a high AD druggability score. Our work on IEGs' 
influential network role is a valuable contribution to guiding interventions for 
diseases marked by dysregulation of their downstream targets and highlights 
MARK4 as a promising underexplored AD-target.

Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already 
appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 
2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput 
technologies, which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological 
processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of 
genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not 
yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are 
systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion 
of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain 
abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments. Conversely, we find 
that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of 
citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to 
affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly 
associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of 
-omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we condense 
our insights into a tool, find my understudied genes (FMUG), that allows 
scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We 
demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain 
understudied in vertebrate aging. FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available 
for download at fmug.amaral.northwestern.edu as a MacOS/Windows app.

Plain Language Summary: Modern techniques for studying human genetics have 
helped to identify 20,000 protein-encoding genes in the human genome. Yet 
scientists have not studied most of them, including genes linked to human 
diseases in genome wide studies. For example, about 44% of the genes associated 
with Alzheimer’s disease have never been mentioned in the title or summary of a 
scientific article. Why so many health-linked genes have yet to be examined is 
unclear. Many genetic studies instead focus on genes already studied before the 
Human Genome Project mapped the entire genome in 2003. There are many reasons 
why scientists may ignore potentially disease-causing genes. They may feel that 
well-studied genes are safer bets or more likely to result in high-profile 
publications. Or they may lack the tools to study less well-characterized genes. 
Richardson et al. analyzed the scientific literature for clues on why so many 
genes are being ignored by scientists. The analysis included hundreds of 
articles that used a wide range of genetic techniques, including genome-wide 
association studies, RNA sequencing, and gene editing tools to scour the genome 
for disease-linked genes. It revealed that scientists abandon the study of many 
genes early in the research process and identify 33 reasons why. Contrary to 
scientists’ fears, Richardson et al. show that reports on understudied genes 
often garner more attention than studies on well-known genes. Richardson et al. 
used their results to create a downloadable tool called “Find My Understudied 
Genes (FMUG)” to help scientists identify understudied genes and counteract bias 
toward more well-studied genes. The app may help scientists make informed 
decisions about which understudied genes to research. If the tool helps boost 
investigation of understudied genes, it may help speed up progress towards 
understanding human genetics and how various genes may contribute to diseases.

Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) are an invaluable source of information 
for drug target development because they provide genetic evidence to support 
protein function, suggest relationships between cis- and trans-associated 
proteins, and link proteins to disease endpoints. Using Olink proteomics data 
for 1,463 proteins measured in over 54,000 samples of the UK Biobank, we 
identified 4,248 associations with 2,821 ratios between protein levels (rQTLs). 
rQTLs were 7.6-fold enriched in known protein-protein interactions, suggesting 
that their ratios reflect biological links between the implicated proteins. 
Conducting a GWAS on ratios increased the number of discovered genetic signals 
by 24.7%. The approach can identify novel loci of clinical relevance, support 
causal gene identification, and reveal complex networks of interacting proteins. 
Taken together, our study adds significant value to the genetic insights that 
can be derived from the UKB proteomics data and motivates the wider use of

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). Blast 
TBI (bTBI) found in Veterans presents with several complications, including 
cognitive and behavioral disturbances and PTE; however, the underlying 
mechanisms that drive the long-term sequelae are not well understood. Using an 
unbiased proteomics approach in a mouse model of repeated bTBI (rbTBI), this 
study addresses this gap in the knowledge. After rbTBI, mice were monitored 
using continuous, uninterrupted video-EEG for up to four months. Following this 
period, we collected cortex and hippocampus tissues from three groups of mice: 
those with post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE+), those without epilepsy (PTE-), and 
the control group (sham). Hundreds of differentially expressed proteins were 
identified in the cortex and hippocampus of PTE+ and PTE- relative to sham. 
Focusing on protein pathways unique to PTE+, pathways related to mitochondrial 
function, post-translational modifications, and transport were disrupted. 
Computational metabolic modeling using dysregulated protein expression predicted 
mitochondrial proton pump dysregulation, suggesting electron transport chain 
dysregulation in the epileptic tissue relative to PTE-. Finally, data mining 
enabled the identification of several novel and previously validated TBI and 
epilepsy biomarkers in our data set, many of which were found to already be 
targeted by drugs in various phases of clinical testing. These findings 
highlight novel proteins and protein pathways that may drive the chronic PTE 
sequelae following rbTBI.

The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome 
(IDG) project aims to aggregate, update, and articulate protein-centric data 
knowledge for the entire human proteome, with emphasis on the understudied 
proteins from the three IDG protein families. KMC collates and analyzes data 
from over 70 resources to compile the Target Central Resource Database (TCRD), 
which is the web-based informatics platform (Pharos). These data include 
experimental, computational, and text-mined information on protein structures, 
compound interactions, and disease and phenotype associations. Based on this 
knowledge, proteins are classified into different Target Development Levels 
(TDLs) for identification of understudied targets. Additional work by the KMC 
focuses on enriching target knowledge and producing DrugCentral and other data 
visualization tools for expanding investigation of understudied targets.

The human kinome, with more than 500 proteins, is crucial for cell signaling and 
disease. Yet, about one-third of kinases lack in-depth study. The Data and 
Resource Generating Center for Understudied Kinases has developed multiple 
resources to address this challenge including creation of a heavy amino acid 
peptide library for parallel reaction monitoring and quantitation of protein 
kinase expression, use of understudied kinases tagged with a miniTurbo-biotin 
ligase to determine interaction networks by proximity-dependent protein 
biotinylation, NanoBRET probe development for screening chemical tool target 
specificity in live cells, characterization of small molecule chemical tools 
inhibiting understudied kinases, and computational tools for defining kinome 
architecture. These resources are available through the Dark Kinase 
Knowledgebase, supporting further research into these understudied protein 
kinases.

There are ∼4500 genes within the 'druggable genome', the subset of the human 
genome that expresses proteins able to bind drug-like molecules, yet existing 
drugs only target a few hundred. A substantial subset of druggable proteins are 
largely uncharacterized or understudied, with many falling within G 
protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), ion channel, and kinase protein families. To 
improve scientific understanding of these three understudied protein families, 
the US National Institutes of Health launched the Illuminating the Druggable 
Genome Program. Now, as the program draws to a close, this review will lay out 
resources developed by the program that are intended to equip the scientific 
community with the tools necessary to explore previously understudied biology 
with the potential to rapidly impact human health.

Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already 
appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 
2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput 
technologies, which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological 
processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of 
genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not 
yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are 
systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion 
of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain 
abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments. Conversely, we find 
that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of 
citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to 
affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly 
associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of - 
omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes we condense 
our insights into a tool, find my understudied genes (FMUG), that allows 
scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We 
demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain 
understudied in vertebrate aging. FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available 
for download at fmug.amaral.northwestern.edu as a MacOS/Windows app.

Breast cancer responds variably to anticancer therapies, often leading to 
significant off-target effects. This study proposes that the variability in 
tumour responses and drug-induced adverse events is linked to the 
transcriptional profiles of cell surface receptors (CSRs) in breast tumours and 
normal tissues. We analysed multiple datasets to compare CSR expression in 
breast tumours with that in non-cancerous human tissues. Our findings correlate 
the drug responses of breast cancer cell lines with the expression levels of 
their targeted CSRs. Notably, we identified distinct differences in CSR 
expression between primary breast tumour subtypes and corresponding cell lines, 
which may influence drug response predictions. Additionally, we used clinical 
trial data to uncover associations between CSR gene expression in healthy 
tissues and the incidence of adverse drug reactions. This integrative approach 
facilitates the selection of optimal CSR targets for therapy, leveraging cell 
line dose-responses, CSR expression in normal tissues, and patient adverse event 
profiles.

MOTIVATION: Protein networks are commonly used for understanding how proteins 
interact. However, they are typically biased by data availability, favoring 
well-studied proteins with more interactions. To uncover functions of 
understudied proteins, we must use data that are not affected by this literature 
bias, such as single-cell RNA-seq and proteomics. Due to data sparseness and 
redundancy, functional association analysis becomes complex.
RESULTS: To address this, we have developed FAVA (Functional Associations using 
Variational Autoencoders), which compresses high-dimensional data into a 
low-dimensional space. FAVA infers networks from high-dimensional omics data 
with much higher accuracy than existing methods, across a diverse collection of 
real as well as simulated datasets. FAVA can process large datasets with over 
0.5 million conditions and has predicted 4210 interactions between 1039 
understudied proteins. Our findings showcase FAVA's capability to offer novel 
perspectives on protein interactions. FAVA functions within the scverse 
ecosystem, employing AnnData as its input source.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code, documentation, and tutorials for 
FAVA are accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/mikelkou/fava. FAVA can also 
be installed and used via pip/PyPI <pip install favapy> as well as via the 
scverse ecosystem

Mitochondria support the energetic demands of the cells. Autophagic turnover of 
mitochondria serves as a critical pathway for mitochondrial homeostasis. It is 
unclear how bioenergetics and autophagy are functionally connected. Here, we 
identify an endolysosomal membrane protein that facilitates autophagy to 
regulate ATP production in glia. We determined that Drosophila tweety (tty) is 
highly expressed in glia and localized to endolysosomes. Diminished fusion 
between autophagosomes and endolysosomes in tty-deficient glia was rescued by 
expressing the human Tweety Homolog 1 (TTYH1). Loss of tty in glia attenuated 
mitochondrial turnover, elevated mitochondrial oxidative stress, and impaired 
locomotor functions. The cellular and organismal defects were partially reversed 
by antioxidant treatment. We performed live-cell imaging of genetically encoded 
metabolite sensors to determine the impact of tty and autophagy deficiencies on 
glial bioenergetics. We found that tty-deficient glia exhibited reduced 
mitochondrial pyruvate consumption accompanied by a shift toward glycolysis for 
ATP production. Likewise, genetic inhibition of autophagy in glia resulted in a 
similar glycolytic shift in bioenergetics. Furthermore, the survival of mutant 
flies became more sensitive to starvation, underlining the significance of tty 
in the crosstalk between autophagy and bioenergetics. Together, our findings 
uncover the role for tty in mitochondrial homeostasis via facilitating 
autophagy, which determines bioenergetic balance in glia.

Psoriasis, a complex and recurrent chronic inflammatory skin disease involving 
various inflammatory cell types, requires effective cell communication to 
maintain the homeostatic balance of inflammation. However, patterns of 
communication at the single-cell level have not been systematically 
investigated. In this study, we employed social network analysis tools, pattern 
recognition, and manifold learning to compare molecular communication features 
between psoriasis cells and normal skin cells. Utilizing a process that 
facilitates the discovery of cell type-specific regulons, we analyzed internal 
regulatory networks among different cells in psoriasis. Advanced techniques for 
the quantitative detection of non-targeted proteins in pathological tissue 
sections were employed to demonstrate protein expression. Our findings revealed 
a synergistic interplay among the communication signals of immune cells in 
psoriasis. B-cells were activated, while Langerhans cells shifted into the 
primary signaling output mode to fulfill antigen presentation, mediating T-cell 
immunity. In contrast to normal skin cells, psoriasis cells shut down numerous 
signaling pathways, influencing the balance of skin cell renewal and 
differentiation. Additionally, we identified a significant number of active cell 
type-specific regulons of resident immune cells around the hair follicle. This 
study unveiled the molecular communication features of the hair follicle 
cell-psoriasis axis, showcasing its potential for therapeutic targeting at the 
single-cell level. By elucidating the pattern of immune cell communication in 
psoriasis and identifying new molecular features of the hair follicle 
cell-psoriasis axis, our findings present innovative strategies for drug 
targeting to enhance psoriasis treatment.

Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses of approved or 
investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical 
indication. Even though many repurposed drugs have been found serendipitously in 
the past, the increasing availability of large volumes of biomedical data has 
enabled more systemic, data-driven approaches for drug candidate identification. 
At National Center of Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), we invent new 
methods to generate new data and information publicly available to spur 
innovation and scientific discovery. In this study, we aimed to explore and 
demonstrate biomedical data generated and collected via two NCATS research 
programs, the Toxicology in the 21st Century program (Tox21) and the Biomedical 
Data Translator (Translator) for the application of drug repurposing. These two 
programs provide complementary types of biomedical data from uncovering 
underlying biological mechanisms with bioassay screening data from Tox21 for 
chemical clustering, to enrich clustered chemicals with scientific evidence 
mined from the Translator towards drug repurposing. 129 chemical clusters have 
been generated and three of them have been further investigated for drug 
repurposing candidate identification, which is detailed as case studies.

Tinnitus is a heritable, highly prevalent auditory disorder treated by multiple 
medical specialties. Previous GWAS indicated high genetic correlations between 
tinnitus and hearing loss, with little indication of differentiating signals. We 
present a GWAS meta-analysis, triple previous sample sizes, and expand to 
non-European ancestries. GWAS in 596,905 Million Veteran Program subjects 
identified 39 tinnitus loci, and identified genes related to neuronal synapses 
and cochlear structural support. Applying state-of-the-art analytic tools, we 
confirm a large number of shared variants, but also a distinct genetic 
architecture of tinnitus, with higher polygenicity and large proportion of 
variants not shared with hearing difficulty. Tissue-expression analysis for 
tinnitus infers broad enrichment across most brain tissues, in contrast to 
hearing difficulty. Finally, tinnitus is not only correlated with hearing loss, 
but also with a spectrum of psychiatric disorders, providing potential new 
avenues for treatment. This study establishes tinnitus as a distinct disorder 
separate from hearing difficulties.

Genetic variations (including substitutions, insertions, and deletions) exert a 
profound influence on DNA sequences. These variations are systematically 
classified as synonymous, nonsynonymous, and nonsense, each manifesting distinct 
effects on proteins. The implementation of high-throughput sequencing has 
significantly augmented our comprehension of the intricate interplay between 
gene variations and protein structure and function, as well as their 
ramifications in the context of diseases. Frameshift variations, particularly 
small insertions and deletions (indels), disrupt protein coding and are 
instrumental in disease pathogenesis. This review presents a succinct review of 
computational methods, databases, current challenges, and future directions in 
predicting the consequences of coding frameshift small indels variations. We 
analyzed the predictive efficacy, reliability, and utilization of computational 
methods and variant account, reliability, and utilization of database. Besides, 
we also compared the prediction methodologies on GOF/LOF pathogenic variation 
data. Addressing the challenges pertaining to prediction accuracy and 
cross-species generalizability, nascent technologies such as AI and deep 
learning harbor immense potential to enhance predictive capabilities. The 
importance of interdisciplinary research and collaboration cannot be overstated 
for devising effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies 
concerning diseases associated with coding frameshift indels variations.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin 
disease whose pathophysiology involves the interplay between genetic and 
environmental factors, ultimately leading to dysfunction of the epidermis. While 
several treatments are effective in symptom management, many existing therapies 
offer only temporary relief and often come with side effects. For this reason, 
the formulation of an effective therapeutic plan is challenging and there is a 
need for more effective and targeted treatments that address the root causes of 
the condition. Here, we hypothesise that modelling the complexity of the 
molecular buildup of the atopic dermatitis can be a concrete means to drive drug 
discovery.
METHODS: We preprocessed, harmonised and integrated publicly available 
transcriptomics datasets of lesional and non-lesional skin from AD patients. We 
inferred co-expression network models of both AD lesional and non-lesional skin 
and exploited their interactional properties by integrating them with a priori 
knowledge in order to extrapolate a robust AD disease module. 
Pharmacophore-based virtual screening was then utilised to build a tailored 
library of compounds potentially active for AD.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified a core disease module for AD, pinpointing 
known and unknown molecular determinants underlying the skin lesions. We 
identified skin- and immune-cell type signatures expressed by the disease 
module, and characterised the impaired cellular functions underlying the complex 
phenotype of atopic dermatitis. Therefore, by investigating the connectivity of 
genes belonging to the AD module, we prioritised novel putative biomarkers of 
the disease. Finally, we defined a tailored compound library by characterising 
the therapeutic potential of drugs targeting genes within the disease module to 
facilitate and tailor future drug discovery efforts towards novel 
pharmacological strategies for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study reveals a core disease module providing 
unprecedented information about genetic, transcriptional and pharmacological 
relationships that foster drug discovery in atopic dermatitis.

Protein kinases are frequently dysregulated and/or mutated in cancer and 
represent essential targets for therapy. Accurate quantification is essential. 
For breast cancer treatment, the identification and quantification of the 
protein kinase ERBB2 is critical for therapeutic decisions. While 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the current clinical diagnostic approach, it is 
only semiquantitative. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics offers quantitative 
assays that, unlike IHC, can be used to accurately evaluate hundreds of kinases 
simultaneously. The enrichment of less abundant kinase targets for 
quantification, along with depletion of interfering proteins, improves 
sensitivity and thus promotes more effective downstream analyses. Multiple 
kinase inhibitors were therefore deployed as a capture matrix for kinase 
inhibitor pulldown (KiP) assays designed to profile the human protein kinome as 
broadly as possible. Optimized assays were initially evaluated in 16 patient 
derived xenograft models (PDX) where KiP identified multiple differentially 
expressed and biologically relevant kinases. From these analyses, an optimized 
single-shot parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) method was developed to improve 
quantitative fidelity. The PRM KiP approach was then reapplied to low quantities 
of proteins typical of yields from core needle biopsies of human cancers. The 
initial prototype targeting 100 kinases recapitulated intrinsic subtyping of PDX 
models obtained from comprehensive proteomic and transcriptomic profiling. 
Luminal and HER2 enriched OCT-frozen patient biopsies subsequently analyzed 
through KiP-PRM also clustered by subtype. Finally, stable isotope labeled 
peptide standards were developed to define a prototype clinical method. Data are 
available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD044655 and PXD046169.

Advancements in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics have greatly facilitated 
the large-scale quantification of proteins and microproteins, thereby revealing 
altered signalling pathways across many different cancer types. However, 
specialized and comprehensive resources are lacking for cancer proteomics. Here, 
we describe CancerProteome (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/CancerProteome), 
which functionally deciphers and visualizes the proteome landscape in cancer. We 
manually curated and re-analyzed publicly available MS-based quantification and 
post-translational modification (PTM) proteomes, including 7406 samples from 21 
different cancer types, and also examined protein abundances and PTM levels in 
31 120 proteins and 4111 microproteins. Six major analytical modules were 
developed with a view to describe protein contributions to carcinogenesis using 
proteome analysis, including conventional analyses of quantitative and the PTM 
proteome, functional enrichment, protein-protein associations by integrating 
known interactions with co-expression signatures, drug sensitivity and clinical 
relevance analyses. Moreover, protein abundances, which correlated with 
corresponding transcript or PTM levels, were evaluated. CancerProteome is 
convenient as it allows users to access specific proteins/microproteins of 
interest using quick searches or query options to generate multiple 
visualization results. In summary, CancerProteome is an important resource, 
which functionally deciphers the cancer proteome landscape and provides a novel 
insight for the identification of tumor protein markers in cancer.

Mounting evidence underscores the intricate interplay between the immune system 
and skeletal muscles in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), as well as during 
regular muscle regeneration. While immune cell infiltration into skeletal 
muscles stands out as a prominent feature in the disease pathophysiology, a 
myriad of secondary defects involving metabolic and inflammatory pathways 
persist, with the key players yet to be fully elucidated. Steroids, currently 
the sole effective therapy for delaying onset and symptom control, come with 
adverse side effects, limiting their widespread use. Preliminary evidence 
spotlighting the distinctive features of T cell profiling in DMD prompts the 
immuno-characterization of circulating cells. A molecular analysis of their 
transcriptome and secretome holds the promise of identifying a subpopulation of 
cells suitable as disease biomarkers. Furthermore, it provides a gateway to 
unraveling new pathological pathways and pinpointing potential therapeutic 
targets. Simultaneously, the last decade has witnessed the emergence of novel 
approaches. The development and equilibrium of both innate and adaptive immune 
systems are intricately linked to the gut microbiota. Modulating 
microbiota-derived metabolites could potentially exacerbate muscle damage 
through immune system activation. Concurrently, genome sequencing has conferred 
clinical utility for rare disease diagnosis since innovative methodologies have 
been deployed to interpret the functional consequences of genomic variations. 
Despite numerous genes falling short as clinical targets for MD, the exploration 
of Tdark genes holds promise for unearthing novel and uncharted therapeutic 
insights. In the quest to expedite the translation of fundamental knowledge into 
clinical applications, the identification of novel biomarkers and disease 
targets is paramount. This initiative not only advances our understanding but 
also paves the way for the design of innovative therapeutic strategies, 
contributing to enhanced care for individuals grappling with these 
incapacitating diseases.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a large group of neurodevelopmental 
conditions featuring, over a wide range of severity and combinations, a core set 
of manifestations (restricted sociality, stereotyped behavior and language 
impairment) alongside various comorbidities. Common and rare variants in several 
hundreds of genes and regulatory regions have been implicated in the molecular 
pathogenesis of ASD along a range of causation evidence strength. Despite 
significant progress in elucidating the impact of few paradigmatic individual 
loci, such sheer complexity in the genetic architecture underlying ASD as a 
whole has hampered the identification of convergent actionable hubs hypothesized 
to relay between the vastness of risk alleles and the core phenotypes. In turn 
this has limited the development of strategies that can revert or ameliorate 
this condition, calling for a systems-level approach to probe the cross-talk of 
cooperating genes in terms of causal interaction networks in order to make 
convergences experimentally tractable and reveal their clinical actionability. 
As a first step in this direction, we have captured from the scientific 
literature information on the causal links between the genes whose variants have 
been associated with ASD and the whole human proteome. This information has been 
annotated in a computer readable format in the SIGNOR database and is made 
freely available in the resource website. To link this information to cell 
functions and phenotypes, we have developed graph algorithms that estimate the 
functional distance of any protein in the SIGNOR causal interactome to 
phenotypes and pathways. The main novelty of our approach resides in the 
possibility to explore the mechanistic links connecting the suggested 
gene-phenotype relations.

Tauopathies, diseases characterized by neuropathological aggregates of tau 
including Alzheimer's disease and subtypes of frontotemporal dementia, make up 
the vast majority of dementia cases. Although there have been recent 
developments in tauopathy biomarkers and disease-modifying treatments, ongoing 
progress is required to ensure these are effective, economical, and accessible 
for the globally ageing population. As such, continued identification of new 
potential drug targets and biomarkers is critical. "Big data" studies, such as 
proteomics, can generate information on thousands of possible new targets for 
dementia diagnostics and therapeutics, but currently remain underutilized due to 
the lack of a clear process by which targets are selected for future drug 
development. In this review, we discuss current tauopathy biomarkers and 
therapeutics, and highlight areas in need of improvement, particularly when 
addressing the needs of frail, comorbid and cognitively impaired populations. We 
highlight biomarkers which have been developed from proteomic data, and outline 
possible future directions in this field. We propose new criteria by which 
potential targets in proteomics studies can be objectively ranked as favorable 
for drug development, and demonstrate its application to our group's recent tau 
interactome dataset as an example.

Tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) is a synthetic food antioxidant with biological 
activities, but little is known about its pharmacological benefits in liver 
disease. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate TBHQ during acute liver damage 
induced by CCl4 (24 h) or BDL (48 h) in Wistar rats. It was found that 
pretreatment with TBHQ prevents 50% of mortality induced by a lethal dose of 
CCl4 (4 g/kg, i.p.), and 80% of BDL+TBHQ rats survived, while only 50% of the 
BDL group survived. Serum markers of liver damage and macroscopic and 
microscopic (H&E staining) observations suggest that TBHQ protects from both 
hepatocellular necrosis caused by the sublethal dose of CCl4 (1.6 g/kg, i.p.), 
as well as necrosis/ductal proliferation caused by BDL. Additionally, online 
databases identified 49 potential protein targets for TBHQ. Finally, a 
biological target candidate (Keap1) was evaluated in a proof-of-concept in 
silico molecular docking assay, resulting in an interaction energy of -5.5491 
kcal/mol, which was higher than RA839 and lower than monoethyl fumarate 
(compounds known to bind to Keap1). These findings suggest that TBHQ increases 
the survival of animals subjected to CCl4 intoxication or BDL, presumably by 
reducing hepatocellular damage, probably due to the interaction of TBHQ with 
Keap1.

OBJECTIVE: Identifying sets of rare diseases with shared aspects of etiology and 
pathophysiology may enable drug repurposing. Toward that aim, we utilized an 
integrative knowledge graph to construct clusters of rare diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on 3242 rare diseases were extracted from the 
National Center for Advancing Translational Science Genetic and Rare Diseases 
Information center internal data resources. The rare disease data enriched with 
additional biomedical data, including gene and phenotype ontologies, biological 
pathway data, and small molecule-target activity data, to create a knowledge 
graph (KG). Node embeddings were trained and clustered. We validated the disease 
clusters through semantic similarity and feature enrichment analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven disease clusters were created with a mean size of 87 
diseases. We validate the clusters quantitatively via semantic similarity based 
on the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology. In addition, the clusters were analyzed 
for enrichment of associated genes, revealing that the enriched genes within 
clusters are highly related.
DISCUSSION: We demonstrate that node embeddings are an effective method for 
clustering diseases within a heterogenous KG. Semantically similar diseases and 
relevant enriched genes have been uncovered within the clusters. Connections 
between disease clusters and drugs are enumerated for follow-up efforts.
CONCLUSION: We lay out a method for clustering rare diseases using graph node 
embeddings. We develop an easy-to-maintain pipeline that can be updated when new 
data on rare diseases emerges. The embeddings themselves can be paired with 
other representation learning methods for other data types, such as drugs, to 
address other predictive modeling problems.

Investigating the human genome is vital for identifying risk factors and 
devising effective therapies to combat genetic disorders and cancer. Despite the 
extensive knowledge of the "light genome", the poorly understood "dark genome" 
remains understudied. In this study, we integrated data from 20,412 
protein-coding genes in Pharos and 8,395 patient-derived tumours from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine the genetic and pharmacological dependencies in 
human cancers and their treatment implications. We discovered that dark genes 
exhibited high mutation rates in certain cancers, similar to light genes. By 
combining the drug response profiles of cancer cells with cell fitness 
post-CRISPR-mediated gene knockout, we identified the crucial vulnerabilities 
associated with both dark and light genes. Our analysis also revealed that 
tumours harbouring dark gene mutations displayed worse overall and disease-free 
survival rates than those without such mutations. Furthermore, dark gene 
expression levels significantly influenced patient survival outcomes. Our 
findings demonstrated a similar distribution of genetic and pharmacological 
dependencies across the light and dark genomes, suggesting that targeting the 
dark genome holds promise for cancer treatment. This study underscores the need 
for ongoing research on the dark genome to better comprehend the underlying 
mechanisms of cancer and develop more effective therapies.

The Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO) is an integrated knowledge graph that 
conceptualizes the complex relationships among protein kinase sequence, 
structure, function, and disease in a human and machine-readable format. In this 
study, we have significantly expanded ProKinO by incorporating additional data 
on expression patterns and drug interactions. Furthermore, we have developed a 
completely new browser from the ground up to render the knowledge graph visible 
and interactive on the web. We have enriched ProKinO with new classes and 
relationships that capture information on kinase ligand binding sites, 
expression patterns, and functional features. These additions extend ProKinO's 
capabilities as a discovery tool, enabling it to uncover novel insights about 
understudied members of the protein kinase family. We next demonstrate the 
application of ProKinO. Specifically, through graph mining and aggregate SPARQL 
queries, we identify the p21-activated protein kinase 5 (PAK5) as one of the 
most frequently mutated dark kinases in human cancers with abnormal expression 
in multiple cancers, including a previously unappreciated role in acute myeloid 
leukemia. We have identified recurrent oncogenic mutations in the PAK5 
activation loop predicted to alter substrate binding and phosphorylation. 
Additionally, we have identified common ligand/drug binding residues in PAK 
family kinases, underscoring ProKinO's potential application in drug discovery. 
The updated ontology browser and the addition of a web component, ProtVista, 
which enables interactive mining of kinase sequence annotations in 3D structures 
and Alphafold models, provide a valuable resource for the signaling community. 
The updated ProKinO database is accessible at https://prokino.uga.edu.

BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating joints disease affecting 
millions of people worldwide. As OA progresses, chondrocytes experience 
heightened catabolic activity, often accompanied by alterations in the 
extracellular environment's osmolarity and acidity. Nevertheless, the precise 
mechanism by which chondrocytes perceive and respond to acidic stress remains 
unknown. Recently, there has been growing interest in pH-sensing G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as GPR68, within musculoskeletal 
tissues. However, function of GPR68 in cartilage during OA progression remains 
unknown. This study aims to identify the role of GPR68 in regulation of 
catabolic gene expression utilizing an in vitro model that simulates catabolic 
processes in OA.
METHODS: We examined the expression of GPCR by analyzing high throughput RNA-Seq 
data in human cartilage isolated from healthy donors and OA patients. 
De-identified and discarded OA cartilage was obtained from joint arthroplasty 
and chondrocytes were prepared by enzymatic digestion. Chondrocytes were treated 
with GPR68 agonist, Ogerin and then stimulated IL1β and RNA isolation was 
performed using Trizol method. Reverse transcription was done using the cDNA 
synthesis kit and the expression of GPR68 and OA related catabolic genes was 
quantified using SYBR® green assays.
RESULTS: The transcriptome analysis revealed that pH sensing GPCR were expressed 
in human cartilage with a notable increase in the expression of GPR68 in OA 
cartilage which suggest a potential role for GPR68 in the pathogenesis of OA. 
Immunohistochemical (IHC) and qPCR analyses in human cartilage representing 
various stages of OA indicated a progressive increase in GPR68 expression in 
cartilage associated with higher OA grades, underscoring a correlation between 
GPR68 expression and the severity of OA. Furthermore, IHC analysis of Gpr68 in 
murine cartilage subjected to surgically induced OA demonstrated elevated levels 
of GPR68 in knee cartilage and meniscus. Using IL1β stimulated in vitro model of 
OA catabolism, our qPCR analysis unveiled a time-dependent increase in GPR68 
expression in response to IL1β stimulation, which correlates with the expression 
of matrix degrading proteases suggesting the role of GPR68 in chondrocytes 
catabolism and matrix degeneration. Using pharmacological activator of GPR68, 
our results further showed that GPR68 activation repressed the expression of 
MMPs in human chondrocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that GPR68 was robustly expressed in human 
cartilage and mice and its expression correlates with matrix degeneration and 
severity of OA progression in human and surgical model. GPR68 activation in 
human chondrocytes further repressed the expression of MMPs under OA 
pathological condition. These results identify GPR68 as a possible therapeutic 
target in the regulation of matrix degradation during OA.

DrugCentral, accessible at https://drugcentral.org , is an open-access online 
drug information repository. It covers over 4950 drugs, incorporating 
structural, physicochemical, and pharmacological details to support drug 
discovery, development, and repositioning. With around 20,000 bioactivity data 
points, manual curation enhances information from several major digital sources. 
Approximately 724 mechanism-of-action (MoA) targets offer updated drug target 
insights. The platform captures clinical data: over 14,300 on- and off-label 
uses, 27,000 contraindications, and around 340,000 adverse drug events from 
pharmacovigilance reports. DrugCentral encompasses information from molecular 
structures to marketed formulations, providing a comprehensive pharmaceutical 
reference. Users can easily navigate basic drug information and key features, 
making DrugCentral a versatile, unique resource. Furthermore, we present a 
use-case example where we utilize experimentally determined data from 
DrugCentral to support drug repurposing. A minimum activity threshold t should 
be considered against novel targets to repurpose a drug. Analyzing 1156 
bioactivities for human MoA targets suggests a general threshold of 1 µM: t = 6 
when expressed as - log[Activity(M)]). This applies to 87% of the drugs. 
Moreover, t can be refined empirically based on water solubility (S): t = 3 - 
logS, for logS < - 3. Alongside the drug repurposing classification scheme, 
which considers intellectual property rights, market exclusivity protections, 
and market accessibility, DrugCentral provides valuable data to prioritize 
candidates for drug repurposing programs efficiently.

Infection with Marburg virus (MARV), the causative agent of Marburg virus 
disease (MVD), results in haemorrhagic disease and high case fatality rates 
(>40%) in humans. Despite its public health relevance, there are no licensed 
vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or treat MVD. A vesicular stomatitis virus 
(VSV)-based vaccine expressing the MARV glycoprotein (VSV-MARV) is currently in 
clinical development. Previously, a single 10 million PFU dose of VSV-MARV 
administered 1-5 weeks before lethal MARV challenge conferred uniform protection 
in nonhuman primates (NHPs), demonstrating fast-acting potential. Additionally, 
our group recently demonstrated that even a low dose VSV-MARV (1000 PFU) 
protected NHPs when given 7 days before MARV challenge. In this study, we 
longitudinally profiled the transcriptional responses of NHPs vaccinated with 
this low dose of VSV-MARV either 14 or 7 days before lethal MARV challenge. NHPs 
vaccinated 14 days before challenge presented with transcriptional changes 
consistent with an antiviral response before challenge. Limited gene expression 
changes were observed in the group vaccinated 7 days before challenge. After 
challenge, genes related to lymphocyte-mediated immunity were only observed in 
the group vaccinated 14 days before challenge, indicating that the length of 
time between vaccination and challenge influenced gene expression. Our results 
indicate that a low dose VSV-MARV elicits distinct immune responses that 
correlate with protection against MVD. A low dose of VSV-MARV should be 
evaluated in clinical rails as it may be an option to deliver beneficial public 
health outcomes to more people in the event of future outbreaks.

Many tools and algorithms are available for analyzing transcriptomics data. 
These include algorithms for performing sequence alignment, data normalization 
and imputation, clustering, identifying differentially expressed genes, and 
performing gene set enrichment analysis. To make the best choice about which 
tools to use, objective benchmarks can be developed to compare the quality of 
different algorithms to extract biological knowledge maximally and accurately 
from these data. The Dexamethasone Benchmark (Dex-Benchmark) resource aims to 
fill this need by providing the community with datasets and code templates for 
benchmarking different gene expression analysis tools and algorithms. The 
resource provides access to a collection of curated RNA-seq, L1000, and ChIP-seq 
data from dexamethasone treatment as well as genetic perturbations of its known 
targets. In addition, the website provides Jupyter Notebooks that use these 
pre-processed curated datasets to demonstrate how to benchmark the different 
steps in gene expression analysis. By comparing two independent data sources and 
data types with some expected concordance, we can assess which tools and 
algorithms best recover such associations. To demonstrate the usefulness of the 
resource for discovering novel drug targets, we applied it to optimize data 
processing strategies for the chemical perturbations and CRISPR single gene 
knockouts from the L1000 transcriptomics data from the Library of Integrated 
Network Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program, with a focus on understudied 
proteins from the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program. Overall, the 
Dex-Benchmark resource can be utilized to assess the quality of transcriptomics 
and other related bioinformatics data analysis workflows. The resource is 
available from: https://maayanlab.github.io/dex-benchmark.

Migraine is a complex neurovascular disease with a range of severity and 
symptoms, yet mostly studied as one phenotype in genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS). Here we combine large GWAS datasets from six European populations to 
study the main migraine subtypes, migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without 
aura (MO). We identified four new MA-associated variants (in PRRT2, PALMD, ABO 
and LRRK2) and classified 13 MO-associated variants. Rare variants with large 
effects highlight three genes. A rare frameshift variant in brain-expressed 
PRRT2 confers large risk of MA and epilepsy, but not MO. A burden test of rare 
loss-of-function variants in SCN11A, encoding a neuron-expressed sodium channel 
with a key role in pain sensation, shows strong protection against migraine. 
Finally, a rare variant with cis-regulatory effects on KCNK5 confers large 
protection against migraine and brain aneurysms. Our findings offer new insights 
with therapeutic potential into the complex biology of migraine and its 
subtypes.

The urgency of finding therapeutic solutions for emerging and existing health 
challenges has never been more pronounced. In the pursuit of this goal, the 
value of a strategy that makes use of existing resources is being recognized: 
drug repurposing or repositioning of compounds for new indications. Such 
approaches are employed against cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple 
sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, and many other diseases. This Collection, aptly titled 
“Drug Repurposing”, includes research and perspectives from scientists at the 
forefront of this innovative field.

The 534 protein kinases encoded in the human genome constitute a large druggable 
class of proteins that include both well-studied and understudied "dark" 
members. Accurate prediction of dark kinase functions is a major bioinformatics 
challenge. Here, we employ a graph mining approach that uses the evolutionary 
and functional context encoded in knowledge graphs (KGs) to predict protein and 
pathway associations for understudied kinases. We propose a new scalable graph 
embedding approach, RegPattern2Vec, which employs regular pattern constrained 
random walks to sample diverse aspects of node context within a KG flexibly. 
RegPattern2Vec learns functional representations of kinases, interacting 
partners, post-translational modifications, pathways, cellular localization, and 
chemical interactions from a kinase-centric KG that integrates and 
conceptualizes data from curated heterogeneous data resources. By 
contextualizing information relevant to prediction, RegPattern2Vec improves 
accuracy and efficiency in comparison to other random walk-based graph embedding 
approaches. We show that the predictions produced by our model overlap with 
pathway enrichment data produced using experimentally validated Protein-Protein 
Interaction (PPI) data from both publicly available databases and experimental 
datasets not used in training. Our model also has the advantage of using the 
collected random walks as biological context to interpret the predicted 
protein-pathway associations. We provide high-confidence pathway predictions for 
34 dark kinases and present three case studies in which analysis of meta-paths 
associated with the prediction enables biological interpretation. Overall, 
RegPattern2Vec efficiently samples multiple node types for link prediction on 
biological knowledge graphs and the predicted associations between understudied 
kinases, pseudokinases, and known pathways serve as a conceptual starting point 
for hypothesis generation and testing.

Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) and other targeted protein degradation 
(TPD) molecules that induce degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) 
offer new opportunities to engage targets that remain challenging to be 
inhibited by conventional small molecules. One fundamental element in the 
degradation process is the E3 ligase. However, less than 2% amongst hundreds of 
E3 ligases in the human genome have been engaged in current studies in the TPD 
field, calling for the recruiting of additional ones to further enhance the 
therapeutic potential of TPD. To accelerate the development of PROTACs utilizing 
under-explored E3 ligases, we systematically characterize E3 ligases from seven 
different aspects, including chemical ligandability, expression patterns, 
protein-protein interactions (PPI), structure availability, functional 
essentiality, cellular location, and PPI interface by analyzing 30 large-scale 
data sets. Our analysis uncovers several E3 ligases as promising extant PROTACs. 
In total, combining confidence score, ligandability, expression pattern, and 
PPI, we identified 76 E3 ligases as PROTAC-interacting candidates. We develop a 
user-friendly and flexible web portal ( https://hanlaboratory.com/E3Atlas/ ) 
aimed at assisting researchers to rapidly identify E3 ligases with promising TPD 
activities against specifically desired targets, facilitating the development of 
these therapies in cancer and beyond.

The purpose of this study was to identify and validate new putative lead drug 
targets in drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) starting from 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) previously identified in mTLE in humans by 
transcriptome analysis. We identified consensus DEGs among two independent mTLE 
transcriptome datasets and assigned them status as "lead target" if they (1) 
were involved in neuronal excitability, (2) were new in mTLE, and (3) were 
druggable. For this, we created a consensus DEG network in STRING and annotated 
it with information from the DISEASES database and the Target Central Resource 
Database (TCRD). Next, we attempted to validate lead targets using qPCR, 
immunohistochemistry, and Western blot on hippocampal and temporal lobe 
neocortical tissue from mTLE patients and non-epilepsy controls, respectively. 
Here we created a robust, unbiased list of 113 consensus DEGs starting from two 
lists of 3040 and 5523 mTLE significant DEGs, respectively, and identified five 
lead targets. Next, we showed that CACNB3, a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel subunit, 
was significantly regulated in mTLE at both mRNA and protein level. Considering 
the key role of Ca2+ currents in regulating neuronal excitability, this 
suggested a role for CACNB3 in seizure generation. This is the first time 
changes in CACNB3 expression have been associated with drug-resistant epilepsy 
in humans, and since efficient therapeutic strategies for the treatment of 
drug-resistant mTLE are lacking, our finding might represent a step toward 
designing such new treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common malignant 
primary brain tumor; however, treatment remains a significant challenge. This 
study aims to identify drug repurposing or repositioning candidates for GBM by 
developing an integrative rare disease profile network containing heterogeneous 
types of biomedical data.
METHODS: We developed a Glioblastoma-based Biomedical Profile Network (GBPN) by 
extracting and integrating biomedical information pertinent to GBM-related 
diseases from the NCATS GARD Knowledge Graph (NGKG). We further clustered the 
GBPN based on modularity classes which resulted in multiple focused subgraphs, 
named mc_GBPN. We then identified high-influence nodes by performing network 
analysis over the mc_GBPN and validated those nodes that could be potential drug 
repurposing or repositioning candidates for GBM.
RESULTS: We developed the GBPN with 1,466 nodes and 107,423 edges and 
consequently the mc_GBPN with forty-one modularity classes. A list of the ten 
most influential nodes were identified from the mc_GBPN. These notably include 
Riluzole, stem cell therapy, cannabidiol, and VK-0214, with proven evidence for 
treating GBM.
CONCLUSION: Our GBM-targeted network analysis allowed us to effectively identify 
potential candidates for drug repurposing or repositioning. Further validation 
will be conducted by using other different types of biomedical and clinical data 
and biological experiments. The findings could lead to less invasive treatments 
for glioblastoma while significantly reducing research costs by shortening the 
drug development timeline. Furthermore, this workflow can be extended to other 
disease areas.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the role of circulating proteins in prostate cancer 
risk can reveal key biological pathways and identify novel targets for cancer 
prevention.
METHODS: We investigated the association of 2,002 genetically predicted 
circulating protein levels with risk of prostate cancer overall, and of 
aggressive and early onset disease, using cis-pQTL Mendelian randomization (MR) 
and colocalization. Findings for proteins with support from both MR, after 
correction for multiple-testing, and colocalization were replicated using two 
independent cancer GWAS, one of European and one of African ancestry. Proteins 
with evidence of prostate-specific tissue expression were additionally 
investigated using spatial transcriptomic data in prostate tumor tissue to 
assess their role in tumor aggressiveness. Finally, we mapped risk proteins to 
drug and ongoing clinical trials targets.
RESULTS: We identified 20 proteins genetically linked to prostate cancer risk 
(14 for overall [8 specific], 7 for aggressive [3 specific], and 8 for early 
onset disease [2 specific]), of which a majority were novel and replicated. 
Among these were proteins associated with aggressive disease, such as PPA2 [Odds 
Ratio (OR) per 1 SD increment = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.54-2.93], PYY [OR = 1.87, 95% 
CI: 1.43-2.44] and PRSS3 [OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.89], and those associated 
with early onset disease, including EHPB1 [OR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.99-4.21], 
POGLUT3 [OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67-0.86] and TPM3 [OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.64]. 
We confirm an inverse association of MSMB with prostate cancer overall [OR = 
0.81, 95% CI: 0.80-0.82], and also find an inverse association with both 
aggressive [OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.82-0.86] and early onset disease [OR = 0.71, 
95% CI: 0.68-0.74]. Using spatial transcriptomics data, we identified MSMB as 
the genome-wide top-most predictive gene to distinguish benign regions from high 
grade cancer regions that had five-fold lower MSMB expression. Additionally, ten 
proteins that were associated with prostate cancer risk mapped to existing 
therapeutic interventions.
CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize the importance of proteomics for improving 
our understanding of prostate cancer etiology and of opportunities for novel 
therapeutic interventions. Additionally, we demonstrate the added benefit of 
in-depth functional analyses to triangulate the role of risk proteins in the 
clinical aggressiveness of prostate tumors. Using these integrated methods, we 
identify a subset of risk proteins associated with aggressive and early onset 
disease as priorities for investigation for the future prevention and treatment 
of prostate cancer.

Molecular mimicry, a phenomenon in which microbial or environmental antigens 
resemble host antigens, has been proposed as a potential trigger for autoimmune 
responses. In this study, we employed a bioinformatics approach to investigate 
the role of molecular mimicry in Clostridioides difficile-caused infections and 
the induction of autoimmune disorders due to this phenomenon. Comparing 
proteomes of host and pathogen, we identified 23 proteins that exhibited 
significant sequence homology and were linked to autoimmune disorders. The 
disorders included rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Alzheimer's disease, etc., 
while infections included viral and bacterial infections like HIV, HCV, and 
tuberculosis. The structure of the homologous proteins was superposed, and RMSD 
was calculated to find the maximum deviation, while accounting for rigid and 
flexible regions. Two sequence mimics (antigenic, non-allergenic, and 
immunogenic) of ≥10 amino acids from these proteins were used to design a 
vaccine construct to explore the possibility of eliciting an immune response. 
Docking analysis of the top vaccine construct C2 showed favorable interactions 
with HLA and TLR-4 receptor, indicating potential efficacy. The B-cell and 
T-helper cell activity was also simulated, showing promising results for 
effective immunization against C. difficile infections. This study highlights 
the potential of C. difficile to trigger autoimmunity through molecular mimicry 
and vaccine design based on sequence mimics that trigger a defensive response.

Protein coding genes exhibit different degrees of intolerance to 
loss-of-function variation. The most intolerant genes, whose function is 
essential for cell or/and organism survival, inform on fundamental biological 
processes related to cell proliferation and organism development and provide a 
window on the molecular mechanisms of human disease. Here we present a brief 
overview of the resources and knowledge gathered around gene essentiality, from 
cancer cell lines to model organisms to human development. We outline the 
implications of using different sources of evidence and definitions to determine 
which genes are essential and highlight how information on the essentiality 
status of a gene can inform novel disease gene discovery and therapeutic target 
identification.

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are hetero-bifunctional molecules that 
induce the degradation of target proteins by recruiting an E3 ligase. PROTACs 
have the potential to inactivate disease-related genes that are considered 
undruggable by small molecules, making them a promising therapy for the 
treatment of incurable diseases. However, only a few hundred proteins have been 
experimentally tested for their amenability to PROTACs, and it remains unclear 
which other proteins in the entire human genome can be targeted by PROTACs. In 
this study, we have developed PrePROTAC, an interpretable machine learning model 
based on a transformer-based protein sequence descriptor and random forest 
classification. PrePROTAC predicts genome-wide targets that can be degraded by 
CRBN, one of the E3 ligases. In the benchmark studies, PrePROTAC achieved a 
ROC-AUC of 0.81, an average precision of 0.84, and over 40% sensitivity at a 
false positive rate of 0.05. When evaluated by an external test set which 
comprised proteins from different structural folds than those in the training 
set, the performance of PrePROTAC did not drop significantly, indicating its 
generalizability. Furthermore, we developed an embedding SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (eSHAP) method, which extends conventional SHAP analysis for 
original features to an embedding space through in silico mutagenesis. This 
method allowed us to identify key residues in the protein structure that play 
critical roles in PROTAC activity. The identified key residues were consistent 
with existing knowledge. Using PrePROTAC, we identified over 600 novel 
understudied proteins that are potentially degradable by CRBN and proposed 
PROTAC compounds for three novel drug targets associated with Alzheimer's 
disease.

Novel biomarkers are key to addressing the ongoing pandemic of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. While new technologies have improved the potential of identifying such 
biomarkers, at the same time there is an increasing need for informed 
prioritization to ensure efficient downstream verification. We have built BALDR, 
an automated pipeline for biomarker comparison and prioritization in the context 
of diabetes. BALDR includes protein, gene, and disease data from major public 
repositories, text-mining data, and human and mouse experimental data from the 
IMI2 RHAPSODY consortium. These data are provided as easy-to-read figures and 
tables enabling direct comparison of up to 20 biomarker candidates for diabetes 
through the public website https://baldr.cpr.ku.dk.

The human genome encodes approximately 20,000 proteins, many still 
uncharacterised. It has become clear that scientific research tends to focus on 
well-studied proteins, leading to a concern that poorly understood genes are 
unjustifiably neglected. To address this, we have developed a publicly available 
and customisable "Unknome database" that ranks proteins based on how little is 
known about them. We applied RNA interference (RNAi) in Drosophila to 260 
unknown genes that are conserved between flies and humans. Knockdown of some 
genes resulted in loss of viability, and functional screening of the rest 
revealed hits for fertility, development, locomotion, protein quality control, 
and resilience to stress. CRISPR/Cas9 gene disruption validated a component of 
Notch signalling and 2 genes contributing to male fertility. Our work 
illustrates the importance of poorly understood genes, provides a resource to 
accelerate future research, and highlights a need to support database curation 
to ensure that misannotation does not erode our awareness of our own ignorance.

The genetic mutations that contribute to the transformation of healthy cells 
into cancerous cells have been the subject of extensive research. The molecular 
aberrations that lead to cancer development are often characterised by 
gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations in a variety of oncogenes and 
tumour suppressor genes. In this study, we investigate the genomic sequences of 
20,331 primary tumours representing 41 distinct human cancer types to identify 
and catalogue the driver mutations present in 727 known cancer genes. Our 
findings reveal significant variations in the frequency of cancer gene mutations 
across different cancer types and highlight the frequent involvement of tumour 
suppressor genes (94%), oncogenes (93%), transcription factors (72%), kinases 
(64%), cell surface receptors (63%), and phosphatases (22%), in cancer. 
Additionally, our analysis reveals that cancer gene mutations are predominantly 
co-occurring rather than exclusive in all types of cancer. Notably, we discover 
that patients with tumours displaying different combinations of gene mutation 
patterns tend to exhibit variable survival outcomes. These findings provide new 
insights into the genetic landscape of cancer and bring us closer to a 
comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the development 
of various forms of cancer.

Anxiety disorders are a group of prevalent and heritable neuropsychiatric 
diseases. We previously conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) which 
identified genomic loci associated with anxiety; however, the biological 
consequences underlying the genetic associations are largely unknown. 
Integrating GWAS and functional genomic data may improve our understanding of 
the genetic effects on intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene 
expression. This can provide an opportunity for the discovery of drug targets 
for anxiety via drug repurposing. We used the GWAS summary statistics to 
determine putative causal genes for anxiety using MAGMA and colocalization 
analyses. A transcriptome-wide association study was conducted to identify genes 
with differential genetically regulated levels of gene expression in human brain 
tissue. The genes were integrated with a large drug-gene expression database 
(Connectivity Map), discovering compounds that are predicted to "normalise" 
anxiety-associated expression changes. The study identified 64 putative causal 
genes associated with anxiety (35 genes upregulated; 29 genes downregulated). 
Drug mechanisms adrenergic receptor agonists, sigma receptor agonists, and 
glutamate receptor agonists gene targets were enriched in anxiety-associated 
genetic signal and exhibited an opposing effect on the anxiety-associated gene 
expression signature. The significance of the project demonstrated genetic links 
for novel drug candidates to potentially advance anxiety therapeutics.

The identification of human proteins that are amenable to pharmacologic 
modulation without significant off-target effects remains an important unsolved 
challenge. Computational methods have been devised to identify features which 
distinguish between "druggable" and "undruggable" proteins, finding that protein 
sequence, tissue and cellular localization, biological role, and position in the 
protein-protein interaction network are all important discriminant factors. 
However, many prior efforts to automate the assessment of protein druggability 
suffer from low performance or poor interpretability. We developed a neural 
network-based machine learning model capable of generating druggability 
sub-scores based on each of four distinct categories, combining them to form an 
overall druggability score. The model achieves an excellent performance in 
separating drugged and undrugged proteins in the human proteome, with an area 
under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.95. Our use of multiple 
sub-scores allows the assessment of potential protein targets of interest based 
on distinct contributors to druggability, leading to a more interpretable and 
holistic model to identify novel targets.

Severe forms of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are associated with point mutations 
in the alternative splicing regulator RBM20 that are frequently located in the 
arginine/serine-rich domain (RS-domain). Such mutations can cause defective 
splicing and cytoplasmic mislocalization, which leads to the formation of 
detrimental cytoplasmic granules. Successful development of personalized 
therapies requires identifying the direct mechanisms of pathogenic RBM20 
variants. Here, we decipher the molecular mechanism of RBM20 mislocalization and 
its specific role in DCM pathogenesis. We demonstrate that mislocalized RBM20 
RS-domain variants retain their splice regulatory activity, which reveals that 
aberrant cellular localization is the main driver of their pathological 
phenotype. A genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen combined with image-enabled cell 
sorting identified Transportin-3 (TNPO3) as the main nuclear importer of RBM20. 
We show that the direct RBM20-TNPO3 interaction involves the RS-domain, and 
is disrupted by pathogenic variants. Relocalization of pathogenic RBM20 variants 
to the nucleus restores alternative splicing and dissolves cytoplasmic granules 
in cell culture and animal models. These findings provide proof-of-principle for 
developing therapeutic strategies to restore RBM20's nuclear localization in 
RBM20-DCM patients.

BACKGROUND: Birth defects are functional and structural abnormalities that 
impact about 1 in 33 births in the United States. They have been attributed to 
genetic and other factors such as drugs, cosmetics, food, and environmental 
pollutants during pregnancy, but for most birth defects there are no known 
causes.
METHODS: To further characterize associations between small molecule compounds 
and their potential to induce specific birth abnormalities, we gathered 
knowledge from multiple sources to construct a reproductive toxicity Knowledge 
Graph (ReproTox-KG) with a focus on associations between birth defects, drugs, 
and genes. Specifically, we gathered data from drug/birth-defect associations 
from co-mentions in published abstracts, gene/birth-defect associations from 
genetic studies, drug- and preclinical-compound-induced gene expression changes 
in cell lines, known drug targets, genetic burden scores for human genes, and 
placental crossing scores for small molecules.
RESULTS: Using ReproTox-KG and semi-supervised learning (SSL), we scored >30,000 
preclinical small molecules for their potential to cross the placenta and induce 
birth defects, and identified >500 birth-defect/gene/drug cliques that can be 
used to explain molecular mechanisms for drug-induced birth defects. The 
ReproTox-KG can be accessed via a web-based user interface available at 
https://maayanlab.cloud/reprotox-kg . This site enables users to explore the 
associations between birth defects, approved and preclinical drugs, and all 
human genes.
CONCLUSIONS: ReproTox-KG provides a resource for exploring knowledge about the 
molecular mechanisms of birth defects with the potential of predicting the 
likelihood of genes and preclinical small molecules to induce birth defects.

Plain Language Summary: While birth defects are common, for most birth defects 
there are no known causes. During pregnancy, developing babies are exposed to 
drugs, cosmetics, food, and environmental pollutants that may cause birth 
defects. However, exactly how these environmental factors are involved in 
producing birth defects is difficult to discern. Also, birth defects can be a 
consequence of the genes inherited from the parents. We combined general data 
about human genes and drugs with specific data previously implicating genes and 
drugs in inducing birth defects to create a knowledge graph representation that 
connects genes, drugs, and birth defects. This knowledge graph can be used to 
explore new links that may explain why birth defects occur, particularly those 
that result from a combination of inherited and environmental influences.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) are believed to share 
clinical symptoms, genetic risk, etiological factors, and pathogenic mechanisms. 
We previously reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms spanning chromosome 
3p21.1 showed significant associations with both schizophrenia and BD, and a 
risk SNP rs2251219 was in linkage disequilibrium with a human specific Alu 
polymorphism rs71052682, which showed enhancer effects on transcriptional 
activities using luciferase reporter assays in U251 and U87MG cells.
METHODS: CRISPR/Cas9-directed genome editing, real-time quantitative PCR, and 
public Hi-C data were utilized to investigate the correlation between the Alu 
polymorphism rs71052682 and NISCH. Primary neuronal culture, immunofluorescence 
staining, co-immunoprecipitation, lentiviral vector production, intracranial 
stereotaxic injection, behavioral assessment, and drug treatment were used to 
examine the physiological impacts of Nischarin (encoded by NISCH).
RESULTS: Deleting the Alu sequence in U251 and U87MG cells reduced mRNA 
expression of NISCH, the gene locates 180 kb from rs71052682, and Hi-C data in 
brain tissues confirmed the extensive chromatin contacts. These data suggested 
that the genetic risk of schizophrenia and BD predicted elevated NISCH 
expression, which was also consistent with the observed higher NISCH mRNA levels 
in the brain tissues from psychiatric patients compared with controls. We then 
found that overexpression of NISCH resulted in a significantly decreased density 
of mushroom dendritic spines with a simultaneously increased density of thin 
dendritic spines in primary cultured neurons. Intriguingly, elevated expression 
of this gene in mice also led to impaired spatial working memory in the Y-maze. 
Given that Nischarin is the target of anti-hypertensive agents clonidine and 
tizanidine, which have shown therapeutic effects in patients with schizophrenia 
and patients with BD in preliminary clinical trials, we demonstrated that 
treatment with those antihypertensive drugs could reduce NISCH mRNA expression 
and rescue the impaired working memory in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: We identify a psychiatric risk gene NISCH at 3p21.1 GWAS locus 
influencing dendritic spine morphogenesis and cognitive function, and Nischarin 
may have potentials for future therapeutic development.

Understudied or dark proteins have the potential to shed light on as-yet 
undiscovered molecular mechanisms that underlie phenotypes and suggest 
innovative therapeutic approaches for many diseases. The Reactome-IDG 
(Illuminating the Druggable Genome) project aims to place dark proteins in the 
context of manually curated, highly reliable pathways in Reactome, the most 
comprehensive, open-source biological pathway knowledgebase, facilitating the 
understanding functions and predicting therapeutic potentials of dark proteins. 
The Reactome-IDG web portal, deployed at https://idg.reactome.org, provides a 
simple, interactive web page for users to search pathways that may functionally 
interact with dark proteins, enabling the prediction of functions of dark 
proteins in the context of Reactome pathways. Enhanced visualization features 
implemented at the portal allow users to investigate the functional contexts for 
dark proteins based on tissue-specific gene or protein expression, drug-target 
interactions, or protein or gene pairwise relationships in the original 
Reactome's systems biology graph notation (SBGN) diagrams or the new simplified 
functional interaction (FI) network view of pathways. The protocols in this 
chapter describe step-by-step procedures to use the web portal to learn 
biological functions of dark proteins in the context of Reactome pathways. ©

Streptococcus pneumoniae contributes to a range of infections, including 
meningitis, pneumonia, otitis media, and sepsis. Infections by this bacterium 
have been associated with the phenomenon of molecular mimicry, which, in turn, 
may contribute to the induction of autoimmunity. In this study, we utilized a 
bioinformatics approach to investigate the potential for S. pneumoniae to incite 
autoimmunity via molecular mimicry. We identified 13 S. pneumoniae proteins that 
have significant sequence similarity to human proteins, with 11 of them linked 
to autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes. 
Using in silico tools, we predicted the sequence as well as the structural 
homology among these proteins. Database mining was conducted to establish links 
between these proteins and autoimmune disorders. The antigenic, non-allergenic, 
and immunogenic sequence mimics were employed to design and validate an immune 
response via vaccine construct design. Mimic-based vaccine construct can prove 
effective for immunization against the S. pneumoniae infections. Immune response 
simulation and binding affinity was assessed through the docking of construct C8 
to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and TLR4 receptor, with promising 
results. Additionally, these mimics were mapped as conserved regions on their 
respective proteins, suggesting their functional importance in S. pneumoniae 
pathogenesis. This study highlights the potential for S. pneumoniae to trigger 
autoimmunity via molecular mimicry and the possibility of vaccine design using 
these mimics for triggering defense response.

Functions of about 10% of all the proteins and their associations with diseases 
are poorly annotated or not annotated at all. Among these proteins, there is a 
group of uncharacterized chromosome-specific open-reading frame genes (CxORFx) 
from the 'Tdark' category. The aim of the work was to reveal associations of 
CxORFx gene expression and ORF proteins' subinteractomes with cancer-driven 
cellular processes and molecular pathways. We performed systems biology and 
bioinformatic analysis of 219 differentially expressed CxORFx genes in cancers, 
an estimation of prognostic significance of novel transcriptomic signatures and 
analysis of subinteractome composition using several web servers (GEPIA2, 
KMplotter, ROC-plotter, TIMER, cBioPortal, DepMap, EnrichR, PepPSy, cProSite, 
WebGestalt, CancerGeneNet, PathwAX II and FunCoup). The subinteractome of each 
ORF protein was revealed using ten different data sources on physical 
protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to obtain representative datasets for the 
exploration of possible cellular functions of ORF proteins through a spectrum of 
neighboring annotated protein partners. A total of 42 out of 219 presumably 
cancer-associated ORF proteins and 30 cancer-dependent binary PPIs were found. 
Additionally, a bibliometric analysis of 204 publications allowed us to retrieve 
biomedical terms related to ORF genes. In spite of recent progress in functional 
studies of ORF genes, the current investigations aim at finding out the 
prognostic value of CxORFx expression patterns in cancers. The results obtained 
expand the understanding of the possible functions of the poorly annotated 
CxORFx in the cancer context.

PNCK, or CAMK1b, is an understudied kinase of the calcium-calmodulin dependent 
kinase family which recently has been identified as a marker of cancer 
progression and survival in several large-scale multi-omics studies. The biology 
of PNCK and its relation to oncogenesis has also begun to be elucidated, with 
data suggesting various roles in DNA damage response, cell cycle control, 
apoptosis and HIF-1-alpha related pathways. To further explore PNCK as a 
clinical target, potent small-molecule molecular probes must be developed. 
Currently, there are no targeted small molecule inhibitors in pre-clinical or 
clinical studies for the CAMK family. Additionally, there exists no 
experimentally derived crystal structure for PNCK. We herein report a 
three-pronged chemical probe discovery campaign which utilized homology 
modeling, machine learning, virtual screening and molecular dynamics to identify 
small molecules with low-micromolar potency against PNCK activity from 
commercially available compound libraries. We report the discovery of a 
hit-series for the first targeted effort towards discovering PNCK inhibitors 
that will serve as the starting point for future medicinal chemistry efforts for 
hit-to-lead optimization of potent chemical probes.

MOTIVATION: The visualization of biological data is a fundamental technique that 
enables researchers to understand and explain biology. Some of these 
visualizations have become iconic, for instance: tree views for taxonomy, 
cartoon rendering of 3D protein structures or tracks to represent features in a 
gene or protein, for instance in a genome browser. Nightingale provides 
visualizations in the context of proteins and protein features.
RESULTS: Nightingale is a library of re-usable data visualization web components 
that are currently used by UniProt and InterPro, among other projects. The 
components can be used to display protein sequence features, variants, 
interaction data, 3D structure, etc. These components are flexible, allowing 
users to easily view multiple data sources within the same context, as well as 
compose these components to create a customized view.

MOTIVATION: To predict drug targets, graph-based machine-learning methods have 
been widely used to capture the relationships between drug, target and disease 
entities in drug-disease-target (DDT) networks. However, many methods cannot 
explicitly consider disease types at inference time and so will predict the same 
target for a given drug under any disease condition. Meanwhile, DDT networks are 
usually organized hierarchically carrying interactive relationships between 
involved entities, but these methods, especially those based on Euclidean 
embedding cannot fully utilize such topological information, which might lead to 
sub-optimal results. We hypothesized that, by importing hyperbolic embedding 
specifically for modeling hierarchical DDT networks, graph-based algorithms 
could better capture relationships between aforementioned entities, which 
ultimately improves target prediction performance.
RESULTS: We formulated the target prediction problem as a knowledge graph 
completion task explicitly considering disease types. We proposed FLONE, a 
hyperbolic embedding-based method based on capturing hierarchical topological 
information in DDT networks. The experimental results on two DDT networks showed 
that by introducing hyperbolic space, FLONE generates more accurate target 
predictions than its Euclidean counterparts, which supports our hypothesis. We 
also devised hyperbolic encoders to fuse external domain knowledge, to make 
FLONE enable handling samples corresponding to previously unseen drugs and 
targets for more practical scenarios.

Stress granules (SGs) and processing-bodies (PBs, P-bodies) are ubiquitous and 
widely studied ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules involved in cellular stress 
response, viral infection, and the tumor microenvironment. While proteomic and 
transcriptomic investigations of SGs and PBs have provided insights into 
molecular composition, chemical tools to probe and modulate RNP granules remain 
lacking. Herein, we combine an immunofluorescence (IF)-based phenotypic screen 
with chemoproteomics to identify sulfonyl-triazoles (SuTEx) capable of 
preventing or inducing SG and PB formation through liganding of tyrosine (Tyr) 
and lysine (Lys) sites in stressed cells. Liganded sites were enriched for 
RNA-binding and protein-protein interaction (PPI) domains, including several 
sites found in RNP granule-forming proteins. Among these, we functionally 
validate G3BP1 Y40, located in the NTF2 dimerization domain, as a ligandable 
site that can disrupt arsenite-induced SG formation in cells. In summary, we 
present a chemical strategy for the systematic discovery of 
condensate-modulating covalent small molecules.

The structure-based design of small-molecule inhibitors targeting 
protein-protein interactions (PPIs) remains a huge challenge as the drug must 
bind typically wide and shallow protein sites. A PPI target of high interest for 
hematological cancer therapy is myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), a prosurvival 
guardian protein from the Bcl-2 family. Despite being previously considered 
undruggable, seven small-molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors have recently entered 
clinical trials. Here, we report the crystal structure of the clinical-stage 
inhibitor AMG-176 bound to Mcl-1 and analyze its interaction along with clinical 
inhibitors AZD5991 and S64315. Our X-ray data reveal high plasticity of Mcl-1 
and a remarkable ligand-induced pocket deepening. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
(NMR)-based free ligand conformer analysis demonstrates that such unprecedented 
induced fit is uniquely achieved by designing highly rigid inhibitors, 
preorganized in their bioactive conformation. By elucidating key chemistry 
design principles, this work provides a roadmap for targeting the largely 
untapped PPI class more successfully.

The patent literature is a potentially valuable source of bioactivity data. In 
this article we describe a process to prioritise 3.7 million life science 
relevant patents obtained from the SureChEMBL database 
(https://www.surechembl.org/), according to how likely they were to contain 
bioactivity data for potent small molecules on less-studied targets, based on 
the classification developed by the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) 
project. The overall goal was to select a smaller number of patents that could 
be manually curated and incorporated into the ChEMBL database. Using relatively 
simple annotation and filtering pipelines, we have been able to identify a 
substantial number of patents containing quantitative bioactivity data for 
understudied targets that had not previously been reported in the peer-reviewed 
medicinal chemistry literature. We quantify the added value of such methods in 
terms of the numbers of targets that are so identified, and provide some 
specific illustrative examples. Our work underlines the potential value in 
searching the patent corpus in addition to the more traditional peer-reviewed 
literature. The small molecules found in these patents, together with their 
measured activity against the targets, are now accessible via the ChEMBL 
database.

BACKGROUND: miR-96-5p is a highly expressed microRNA in the retina of subjects 
with diabetes. The INS/AKT/GLUT4 signaling axis is the main cell signaling 
pathway of glucose uptake in cells. Here, we investigated the role of miR-96-5p 
in this signaling pathway.
METHODS: Expression levels of miR-96-5p and its target genes were measured under 
high glucose conditions, in the retina of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, 
in the retina of AAV-2-eGFP-miR-96 or GFP intravitreal injected mice and in the 
retina of human donors with diabetic retinopathy (DR). MTT, wound healing, tube 
formation, Western blot, TUNEL, angiogenesis assays and hematoxylin-eosin 
staining of the retinal sections were performed.
RESULTS: miR-96-5p expression was increased under high glucose conditions in 
mouse retinal pigment epithelial (mRPE) cells, in the retina of mice receiving 
AAV-2 carrying miR-96 and STZ-treated mice. Expression of the miR-96-5p target 
genes related to the INS/AKT/GLUT4 signaling pathway was reduced following 
miR-96-5p overexpression. mmu-miR-96-5p expression decreased cell proliferation 
and thicknesses of retinal layers. Cell migration, tube formation, vascular 
length, angiogenesis, and TUNEL-positive cells were increased.
CONCLUSIONS: In in vitro and in vivo studies and in human retinal tissues, 
miR-96-5p regulated the expression of the PIK3R1, PRKCE, AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 
genes in the INS/AKT axis and some genes involved in GLUT4 trafficking, such as 
Pak1, Snap23, RAB2a, and Ehd1. Because disruption of the INS/AKT/GLUT4 signaling 
axis causes advanced glycation end product accumulation and inflammatory 
responses, the inhibition of miR-96-5p expression could ameliorate DR.

Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common malignant 
primary brain tumor; however, treatment remains a significant challenge. This 
study aims to identify drug repurposing candidates for GBM by developing an 
integrative rare disease profile network containing heterogeneous types of 
biomedical data. Methods We developed a Glioblastoma-based Biomedical Profile 
Network (GBPN) by extracting and integrating biomedical information pertinent to 
GBM-related diseases from the NCATS GARD Knowledge Graph (NGKG). We further 
clustered the GBPN based on modularity classes which resulted in multiple 
focused subgraphs, named mc_GBPN. We then identified high-influence nodes by 
performing network analysis over the mc_GBPN and validated those nodes that 
could be potential drug repositioning candidates for GBM. Results We developed 
the GBPN with 1,466 nodes and 107,423 edges and consequently the mc_GBPN with 
forty-one modularity classes. A list of the ten most influential nodes were 
identified from the mc_GBPN. These notably include Riluzole, stem cell therapy, 
cannabidiol, and VK-0214, with proven evidence for treating GBM. Conclusion Our 
GBM-targeted network analysis allowed us to effectively identify potential 
candidates for drug repurposing. This could lead to less invasive treatments for 
glioblastoma while significantly reducing research costs by shortening the drug 
development timeline. Furthermore, this workflow can be extended to other 
disease areas.

Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental brain disorder whose genetic risk is 
associated with shifting clinical phenomena across the life span. We 
investigated the convergence of putative schizophrenia risk genes in brain 
coexpression networks in postmortem human prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 
hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and dentate gyrus granule cells, parsed by 
specific age periods (total N = 833). The results support an early prefrontal 
involvement in the biology underlying schizophrenia and reveal a dynamic 
interplay of regions in which age parsing explains more variance in 
schizophrenia risk compared to lumping all age periods together. Across multiple 
data sources and publications, we identify 28 genes that are the most 
consistently found partners in modules enriched for schizophrenia risk genes in 
DLPFC; twenty-three are previously unidentified associations with schizophrenia. 
In iPSC-derived neurons, the relationship of these genes with schizophrenia risk 
genes is maintained. The genetic architecture of schizophrenia is embedded in 
shifting coexpression patterns across brain regions and time, potentially 
underwriting its shifting clinical presentation.

OBJECTIVES: We propose the origami plot, which maintains the original 
functionality of a radar chart and avoids potential misuse of its connected 
regions, with newly added features to better assist multicriteria 
decision-making.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Built upon a radar chart, the origami plot adds 
additional auxiliary axes and points such that the area of the connected region 
of all dots is invariant to the ordering of axes. As such, it enables ranking 
different individuals by the overall performance for multicriteria 
decision-making while maintaining the intuitive visual appeal of the radar 
chart. We develop extensions of the origami plot, including the weighted origami 
plot, which allows reweighting of each attribute to define the overall 
performance, and the pairwise origami plot, which highlights comparisons between 
two individuals.
RESULTS: We illustrate the different versions of origami plots using the 
hospital compare database developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS). The plot shows individual hospital's performance on mortality, 
readmission, complication, and infection, as well as patient experience and 
timely and effective care, as well as their overall performance across these 
metrics. The weighted origami plot allows weighing the attributes differently 
when some are more important than others. We illustrate the potential use of the 
pairwise origami plot in electronic health records (EHR) system to monitor five 
clinical measures (body mass index [BMI]), fasting glucose level, blood 
pressure, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein ([LDL] cholesterol) of a 
patient across multiple hospital visits.
CONCLUSION: The origami plot is a useful visualization tool to assist 
multicriteria decision making. It improves radar charts by avoiding potential 
misuse of the connected regions. It has several new features and allows flexible 
customization.

The Never in Mitosis Gene A (NIMA)-related kinases (NEKs) are a group of 
serine/threonine kinases that are involved in a wide array of cellular processes 
including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair response (DDR), apoptosis, 
and microtubule organization. Recent studies have identified the involvement of 
NEK family members in various diseases such as autoimmune disorders, 
malignancies, and developmental defects. Despite the existing literature 
exemplifying the importance of the NEK family of kinases, this family of protein 
kinases remains understudied. This report seeks to provide a foundation for 
investigating the role of different NEKs in malignancies. We do this by 
evaluating the 11 NEK family kinase gene expression associations with patients' 
overall survival (OS) from various cancers using the Kaplan-Meier Online Tool 
(KMPlotter) to correlate the relationship between mRNA expression of NEK1-11 in 
various cancers and patient survival. Furthermore, we use the Catalog of Somatic 
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database to identify NEK family mutations in 
cancers of different tissues. Overall, the data suggest that the NEK family has 
varying associations with patient survival in different cancers with 
tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting effects being tissue-dependent.

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are hetero-bifunctional molecules. They 
induce the degradation of a target protein by recruiting an E3 ligase to the 
target. The PROTAC can inactivate disease-related genes that are considered as 
understudied, thus has a great potential to be a new type of therapy for the 
treatment of incurable diseases. However, only hundreds of proteins have been 
experimentally tested if they are amenable to the PROTACs. It remains elusive 
what other proteins can be targeted by the PROTAC in the entire human genome. 
For the first time, we have developed an interpretable machine learning model 
PrePROTAC, which is based on a transformer-based protein sequence descriptor and 
random forest classification to predict genome-wide PROTAC-induced targets 
degradable by CRBN, one of the E3 ligases. In the benchmark studies, PrePROTAC 
achieved ROC-AUC of 0.81, PR-AUC of 0.84, and over 40% sensitivity at a false 
positive rate of 0.05, respectively. Furthermore, we developed an embedding 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (eSHAP) method to identify positions in the 
protein structure, which play key roles in the PROTAC activity. The key residues 
identified were consistent with our existing knowledge. We applied PrePROTAC to 
identify more than 600 novel understudied proteins that are potentially 
degradable by CRBN, and proposed PROTAC compounds for three novel drug targets 
associated with Alzheimer's disease.
AUTHOR SUMMARY: Many human diseases remain incurable because disease-causing 
genes cannot by selectively and effectively targeted by small molecules. 
Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), an organic compound that binds to both a 
target and a degradation-mediating E3 ligase, has emerged as a promising 
approach to selectively target disease-driving genes that are not druggable by 
small molecules. Nevertheless, not all of proteins can be accommodated by E3 
ligases, and be effectively degraded. Knowledge on the degradability of a 
protein will be crucial for the design of PROTACs. However, only hundreds of 
proteins have been experimentally tested if they are amenable to the PROTACs. It 
remains elusive what other proteins can be targeted by the PROTAC in the entire 
human genome. In this paper, we propose an intepretable machine learning model 
PrePROTAC that takes advantage of powerful protein language modeling. PrePROTAC 
achieves high accuracy when evaluated by an external dataset which comes from 
different gene families from the proteins in the training data, suggesting the 
generalizability of PrePROTAC. We apply PrePROTAC to the human genome, and 
identify more than 600 understudied proteins that are potentially responsive to 
the PROTAC. Furthermore, we design three PROTAC compounds for novel drug targets 
associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Developments in sequencing technologies and the sequencing of an ever-increasing 
number of genomes have revolutionised studies of biodiversity and organismal 
evolution. This accumulation of data has been paralleled by the creation of 
numerous public biological databases through which the scientific community can 
mine the sequences and annotations of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of 
multiple species. However, to find the appropriate databases and bioinformatic 
tools for respective inquiries and aims can be challenging. Here, we present a 
compilation of DNA and protein databases, as well as bioinformatic tools for 
phylogenetic reconstruction and a wide range of studies on molecular evolution. 
We provide a protocol for information extraction from biological databases and 
simple phylogenetic reconstruction using probabilistic and distance methods, 
facilitating the study of biodiversity and evolution at the molecular level for 
the broad scientific community.

OBJECTIVE: Identifying sets of rare diseases with shared aspects of etiology and 
pathophysiology may enable drug repurposing and/or platform based therapeutic 
development. Toward that aim, we utilized an integrative knowledge graph-based 
approach to constructing clusters of rare diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on 3,242 rare diseases were extracted from the 
National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) Genetic and Rare 
Diseases Information center (GARD) internal data resources. The rare disease 
data was enriched with additional biomedical data, including gene and phenotype 
ontologies, biological pathway data and small molecule-target activity data, to 
create a knowledge graph (KG). Node embeddings were used to convert nodes into 
vectors upon which k-means clustering was applied. We validated the disease 
clusters through semantic similarity and feature enrichment analysis.
RESULTS: A node embedding model was trained on the ontology enriched rare 
disease KG and k-means clustering was applied to the embedding vectors resulting 
in 37 disease clusters with a mean size of 87 diseases. We validate the disease 
clusters quantitatively by looking at semantic similarity of clustered diseases, 
using the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology. In addition, the clusters were 
analyzed for enrichment of associated genes, revealing that the enriched genes 
within clusters were shown to be highly related.
DISCUSSION: We demonstrate that node embeddings are an effective method for 
clustering diseases within a heterogenous KG. Semantically similar diseases and 
relevant enriched genes have been uncovered within the clusters. Connections 
between disease clusters and approved or investigational drugs are enumerated 
for follow-up efforts.
CONCLUSION: Our study lays out a method for clustering rare diseases using the 
graph node embeddings. We develop an easy to maintain pipeline that can be 
updated when new data on rare diseases emerges. The embeddings themselves can be 
paired with other representation learning methods for other data types, such as 
drugs, to address other predictive modeling problems. Detailed subnetwork 
analysis and in-depth review of individual clusters may lead to translatable 
findings. Future work will focus on incorporation of additional data sources, 
with a particular focus on common disease data.

Biological networks are often used to represent complex biological systems, 
which can contain several types of entities. Analysis and visualization of such 
networks is supported by the Cytoscape software tool and its many apps. While 
earlier versions of stringApp focused on providing intraspecies protein-protein 
interactions from the STRING database, the new stringApp 2.0 greatly improves 
the support for heterogeneous networks. Here, we highlight new functionality 
that makes it possible to create networks that contain proteins and interactions 
from STRING as well as other biological entities and associations from other 
sources. We exemplify this by complementing a published SARS-CoV-2 interactome 
with interactions from STRING. We have also extended stringApp with new data and 
query functionality for protein-protein interactions between eukaryotic 
parasites and their hosts. We show how this can be used to retrieve and 
visualize a cross-species network for a malaria parasite, its host, and its 
vector. Finally, the latest stringApp version has an improved user interface, 
allows retrieval of both functional associations and physical interactions, and 
supports group-wise enrichment analysis of different parts of a network to aid 
biological interpretation. stringApp is freely available at 
https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are causally related, yet there is considerable 
heterogeneity in the consequences of both conditions and the mechanisms of 
action are poorly defined. Here we show a genetic-driven approach defining two 
obesity profiles that convey highly concordant and discordant diabetogenic 
effects. We annotate and then compare association signals for these profiles 
across clinical and molecular phenotypic layers. Key differences are identified 
in a wide range of traits, including cardiovascular mortality, fat distribution, 
liver metabolism, blood pressure, specific lipid fractions and blood levels of 
proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodelling. We find marginal 
differences in abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes bacteria in the gut. 
Instrumental analyses reveal prominent causal roles for waist-to-hip ratio, 
blood pressure and cholesterol content of high-density lipoprotein particles in 
the development of diabetes in obesity. We prioritize 17 genes from the 
discordant signature that convey protection against type 2 diabetes in obesity, 
which may represent logical targets for precision medicine approaches.

The stria vascularis (SV) has been shown to play a critical role in the 
pathogenesis of many diseases associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), 
including age-related hearing loss (ARHL), noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), 
hereditary hearing loss (HHL), and drug-induced hearing loss (DIHL), among 
others. There are a number of other disorders of hearing loss that may be 
relatively neglected due to being underrecognized, poorly understood, lacking 
robust diagnostic criteria or effective treatments. A few examples of these 
diseases include autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) and/or autoinflammatory 
inner ear disease (AID), Meniere's disease (MD), sudden sensorineural hearing 
loss (SSNHL), and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-related hearing loss (CRHL). Although 
these diseases may often differ in etiology, there have been recent studies that 
support the involvement of the SV in the pathogenesis of many of these 
disorders. We strive to highlight a few prominent examples of these frequently 
neglected otologic diseases and illustrate the relevance of understanding SV 
composition, structure and function with regards to these disease processes. In 
this study, we review the physiology of the SV, lay out the importance of these 
neglected otologic diseases, highlight the current literature regarding the role 
of the SV in these disorders, and discuss the current strategies, both approved 
and investigational, for management of these disorders.

Systematically discovering protein-ligand interactions across the entire human 
and pathogen genomes is critical in chemical genomics, protein function 
prediction, drug discovery, and many other areas. However, more than 90% of gene 
families remain "dark"-i.e., their small-molecule ligands are undiscovered due 
to experimental limitations or human/historical biases. Existing computational 
approaches typically fail when the dark protein differs from those with known 
ligands. To address this challenge, we have developed a deep learning framework, 
called PortalCG, which consists of four novel components: (i) a 3-dimensional 
ligand binding site enhanced sequence pre-training strategy to encode the 
evolutionary links between ligand-binding sites across gene families; (ii) an 
end-to-end pretraining-fine-tuning strategy to reduce the impact of inaccuracy 
of predicted structures on function predictions by recognizing the 
sequence-structure-function paradigm; (iii) a new out-of-cluster meta-learning 
algorithm that extracts and accumulates information learned from predicting 
ligands of distinct gene families (meta-data) and applies the meta-data to a 
dark gene family; and (iv) a stress model selection step, using different gene 
families in the test data from those in the training and development data sets 
to facilitate model deployment in a real-world scenario. In extensive and 
rigorous benchmark experiments, PortalCG considerably outperformed 
state-of-the-art techniques of machine learning and protein-ligand docking when 
applied to dark gene families, and demonstrated its generalization power for 
target identifications and compound screenings under out-of-distribution (OOD) 
scenarios. Furthermore, in an external validation for the multi-target compound 
screening, the performance of PortalCG surpassed the rational design from 
medicinal chemists. Our results also suggest that a differentiable 
sequence-structure-function deep learning framework, where protein structural 
information serves as an intermediate layer, could be superior to conventional 
methodology where predicted protein structures were used for the compound 
screening. We applied PortalCG to two case studies to exemplify its potential in 
drug discovery: designing selective dual-antagonists of dopamine receptors for 
the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), and illuminating the understudied 
human genome for target diseases that do not yet have effective and safe 
therapeutics. Our results suggested that PortalCG is a viable solution to the 
OOD problem in exploring understudied regions of protein functional space.

Pulmonary function is an indicator of well-being, and pulmonary pathologies are 
the third major cause of death worldwide. We analysed the UK Biobank genome-wide 
association summary statistics of pulmonary function for Europeans and 
individuals of recent African descent to identify variants associated with the 
trait in the two ancestries. Here, we show 627 variants in Europeans and 3 in 
Africans associated with three pulmonary function parameters. In addition to the 
110 variants in Europeans previously reported to be associated with phenotypes 
related to pulmonary function, we identify 279 novel loci, including an ISX 
intergenic variant rs369476290 on chromosome 22 in Africans. Remarkably, we find 
no shared variants among Africans and Europeans. Furthermore, enrichment 
analyses of variants separately for each ancestry background reveal significant 
enrichment for terms related to pulmonary phenotypes in Europeans but not 
Africans. Further analysis of studies of pulmonary phenotypes reveals that 
individuals of European background are disproportionally overrepresented in 
datasets compared to Africans, with the gap widening over the past five years. 
Our findings extend our understanding of the different variants that modify the 
pulmonary function in Africans and Europeans, a promising finding for future 
GWASs and medical studies.

The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project aims to improve our 
understanding of understudied proteins and our ability to study them in the 
context of disease biology by perturbing them with small molecules, biologics, 
or other therapeutic modalities. Two main products from the IDG effort are the 
Target Central Resource Database (TCRD) (http://juniper.health.unm.edu/tcrd/), 
which curates and aggregates information, and Pharos (https://pharos.nih.gov/), 
a web interface for fusers to extract and visualize data from TCRD. Since the 
2021 release, TCRD/Pharos has focused on developing visualization and analysis 
tools that help reveal higher-level patterns in the underlying data. The current 
iterations of TCRD and Pharos enable users to perform enrichment calculations 
based on subsets of targets, diseases, or ligands and to create interactive heat 
maps and UpSet charts of many types of annotations. Using several examples, we 
show how to address disease biology and drug discovery questions through 
enrichment calculations and UpSet charts.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Notwithstanding the 
huge investments in drug development, only one disease-modifying treatment has 
been recently approved. Here we present a single-cell-led systems biology 
pipeline for the identification of drug repurposing candidates. Using 
single-cell RNA sequencing data of brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer's 
disease, genome-wide association study results, and multiple gene annotation 
resources, we built a multi-cellular Alzheimer's disease molecular network that 
we leveraged for gaining cell-specific insights into Alzheimer's disease 
pathophysiology and for the identification of drug repurposing candidates. Our 
computational approach pointed out 54 candidate drugs, mainly targeting MAPK and 
IGF1R signaling pathways, which could be further evaluated for their potential 
as Alzheimer's disease therapy.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a fatal disease when advanced. While immunotherapy 
and tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based combinations are associated with improved 
survival, the majority of patients eventually succumb to the disease. Through a 
comprehensive pan-cancer, pan-kinome analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 
pregnancy-upregulated non-ubiquitous calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase (PNCK), 
was identified as the most differentially overexpressed kinase in RCC. PNCK 
overexpression correlated with tumor stage, grade and poor survival. PNCK 
overexpression in RCC cells was associated with increased CREB phosphorylation, 
increased cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression. PNCK down-regulation, 
conversely, was associated with the opposite, in addition to increased 
apoptosis. Pathway analyses in PNCK knockdown cells showed significant 
down-regulation of hypoxia and angiogenesis pathways, as well as the modulation 
of the cell cycle, DNA damage, and apoptosis pathways. These results demonstrate 
for the first time the biological role of PNCK, an understudied kinase, in RCC 
and validate PNCK as a druggable target.

Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS), also known as molecular docking, has 
been increasingly applied to discover small-molecule ligands based on the 
protein structures in the early stage of drug discovery. In this review, we 
comprehensively surveyed the prospective applications of molecular docking 
judged by solid experimental validations in the literature over the past fifteen 
years. Herein, we systematically analyzed the novelty of the targets and the 
docking hits, practical protocols of docking screening, and the following 
experimental validations. Among the 419 case studies we reviewed, most virtual 
screenings were carried out on widely studied targets, and only 22% were on 
less-explored new targets. Regarding docking software, GLIDE is the most popular 
one used in molecular docking, while the DOCK 3 series showed a strong capacity 
for large-scale virtual screening. Besides, the majority of identified hits are 
promising in structural novelty and one-quarter of the hits showed better 
potency than 1 μM, indicating that the primary advantage of SBVS is to discover 
new chemotypes rather than highly potent compounds. Furthermore, in most 
studies, only in vitro bioassays were carried out to validate the docking hits, 
which might limit the further characterization and development of the identified 
active compounds. Finally, several successful stories of SBVS with extensive 
experimental validations have been highlighted, which provide unique insights 
into future SBVS drug discovery campaigns.

In recent years, a growing interest in the characterization of the molecular 
basis of psoriasis has been observed. However, despite the availability of a 
large amount of molecular data, many pathogenic mechanisms of psoriasis are 
still poorly understood. In this study, we performed an integrated analysis of 
23 public transcriptomic datasets encompassing both lesional and uninvolved skin 
samples from psoriasis patients. We defined comprehensive gene co-expression 
network models of psoriatic lesions and uninvolved skin. Moreover, we curated 
and exploited a wide range of functional information from multiple public 
sources in order to systematically annotate the inferred networks. The 
integrated analysis of transcriptomics data and co-expression networks 
highlighted genes that are frequently dysregulated and show aberrant patterns of 
connectivity in the psoriatic lesion compared with the unaffected skin. Our 
approach allowed us to also identify plausible, previously unknown, actors in 
the expression of the psoriasis phenotype. Finally, we characterized communities 
of co-expressed genes associated with relevant molecular functions and 
expression signatures of specific immune cell types associated with the 
psoriasis lesion. Overall, integrating experimental driven results with curated 
functional information from public repositories represents an efficient approach 
to empower knowledge generation about psoriasis and may be applicable to other 
complex diseases.

The druggability of targets is a crucial consideration in drug target selection. 
Here, we adopt a stochastic semi-supervised ML framework to develop DrugnomeAI, 
which estimates the druggability likelihood for every protein-coding gene in the 
human exome. DrugnomeAI integrates gene-level properties from 15 sources 
resulting in 324 features. The tool generates exome-wide predictions based on 
labelled sets of known drug targets (median AUC: 0.97), highlighting features 
from protein-protein interaction networks as top predictors. DrugnomeAI provides 
generic as well as specialised models stratified by disease type or drug 
therapeutic modality. The top-ranking DrugnomeAI genes were significantly 
enriched for genes previously selected for clinical development programs (p 
value < 1 × 10-308) and for genes achieving genome-wide significance in 
phenome-wide association studies of 450 K UK Biobank exomes for binary (p 
value = 1.7 × 10-5) and quantitative traits (p value = 1.6 × 10-7). We accompany 
our method with a web application ( http://drugnomeai.public.cgr.astrazeneca.com 
) to visualise the druggability predictions and the key features that define 
gene druggability, per disease type and modality.

Target discovery and identification processes are driven by the increasing 
amount of biomedical data. The vast numbers of unstructured texts of biomedical 
publications provide a rich source of knowledge for drug target discovery 
research and demand the development of specific algorithms or tools to 
facilitate finding disease genes and proteins. Text mining is a method that can 
automatically mine helpful information related to drug target discovery from 
massive biomedical literature. However, there is a substantial lag between 
biomedical publications and the subsequent abstraction of information extracted 
by text mining to databases. The knowledge graph is introduced to integrate 
heterogeneous biomedical data. Here, we describe e-TSN (Target significance and 
novelty explorer, http://www.lilab-ecust.cn/etsn/), a knowledge visualization 
web server integrating the largest database of associations between targets and 
diseases from the full scientific literature by constructing significance and 
novelty scoring methods based on bibliometric statistics. The platform aims to 
visualize target-disease knowledge graphs to assist in prioritizing candidate 
disease-related proteins. Approved drugs and associated bioactivities for each 
interested target are also provided to facilitate the visualization of 
drug-target relationships. In summary, e-TSN is a fast and customizable 
visualization resource for investigating and analyzing the intricate 
target-disease networks, which could help researchers understand the mechanisms 
underlying complex disease phenotypes and improve the drug discovery and 
development efficiency, especially for the unexpected outbreak of infectious 
disease pandemics like COVID-19.

In eukaryotes, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) function in many fundamental cellular 
events such as precursor messenger RNA splicing, gene expression regulation, and 
ribosomal RNA processing. The snRNA activating protein complex (SNAPc) 
exclusively recognizes the proximal sequence element (PSE) at snRNA promoters 
and recruits RNA polymerase II or III to initiate transcription. In view that 
homozygous gene-knockout of SNAPc core subunits causes mouse embryonic 
lethality, functions of SNAPc are almost housekeeping. But so far, the 
structural insight into how SNAPc assembles and regulates snRNA transcription 
initiation remains unclear. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy 
structure of the essential part of human SNAPc in complex with human U6-1 PSE at 
an overall resolution of 3.49 Å. This structure reveals the three-dimensional 
features of three conserved subunits (N-terminal domain of SNAP190, SNAP50, and 
SNAP43) and explains how they are assembled into a stable mini-SNAPc in 
PSE-binding state with a "wrap-around" mode. We identify three important motifs 
of SNAP50 that are involved in both major groove and minor groove recognition of 
PSE, in coordination with the Myb domain of SNAP190. Our findings further 
elaborate human PSE sequence conservation and compatibility for SNAPc 
recognition, providing a clear framework of snRNA transcription initiation, 
especially the U6 system.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a severe inflammation-related disease which leads to 
cartilage destruction. The retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) has been 
indicated to be involved in many inflammation processes. However, the role and 
mechanism of RARγ in cartilage destruction caused by inflammation in OA are 
still unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the RARγ was highly expressed in 
chondrocytes of OA patients compared with healthy people and was positively 
correlated with the damage degree of cartilage in OA. Cytokine TNF-α promoted 
the transcription and expression of RARγ through activating the NF-κB pathway in 
OA cartilage. In addition, the overexpression of RARγ resulted in the 
upregulation of matrix degradation and inflammation associated genes and 
downregulation of differentiation and collagen production genes in human normal 
chondrocyte C28/I2 cells. Mechanistically, overexpression of RARγ could increase 
the level of p-IκBα and p-P65 to regulate the expression of downstream genes. 
RARγ and IκBα also could interact with each other and had the same localization 
in C28/I2 cells. Moreover, the SD rats OA model induced by monosodium 
iodoacetate indicated that CD437 (RARγ agonist) and TNF-α accelerated the OA 
progression, including more severe cartilage layer destruction, larger knee 
joint diameter, and higher serum ALP levels, while LY2955303 (RARγ inhibitor) 
showed the opposite result. RARγ was also highly expressed in OA group and even 
higher in TNF-α group. In conclusion, RARγ/NF-κB positive feedback loop was 
activated by TNF-α in chondrocyte to promote cartilage destruction. Our data not 
only propose a novel and precise molecular mechanism for OA disease but also 
provide a prospective strategy for the treatment.

Pomegranate (PMG; Punica granatum L.) fruits possess a well-balanced 
nutrient/phytochemical composition, with proven adjuvant benefits in 
experimental cancer chemotherapy; however, such bioactivity could be affected by 
PMG's phenogenotype (varietal). Here, the chemical and phytochemical 
(UPLC-DAD-MS2) composition, antioxidant capacity and anticancer potential [in 
vitro (MTT assay) and in silico (foodinformatics)] of three PMG fruits of 
different aryl color [red (cv. Wonderful), pink (cv. Molar de Elche), and white 
(cv. Indian)] were evaluated. The macro/micronutrient (ascorbic acid, tocols, 
carotenoids), organic acid (citric/malic), and polyphenol content were changed 
by PMG's varietal and total antioxidant activity (ABTS, alcoholic > hexane 
extract) in the order of red > pink > white. However, their in vitro 
cytotoxicity was the same (IC50 > 200 μg.mL-1) against normal (retinal) and 
cancer (breast, lung, colorectal) cell lines. Sixteen major phytochemicals were 
tentatively identified, four of them with a high GI absorption/bioavailability 
score [Ellagic (pink), vanillic (red), gallic (white) acids, D-(+)-catechin 
(white)] and three of them with multiple molecular targets [Ellagic (52) > 
vanillic (32) > gallic (23)] associated with anticancer (at initiation and 
promotion stages) activity. The anticancer potential of the PMG fruit is 
phenogenotype-specific, although it could be more effective in nutraceutical 
formulations (concentrates).

Corticosteroids, oral or transtympanic, remain the mainstay for inner ear 
diseases characterized by hearing fluctuation or sudden changes in hearing, 
including sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), Meniere's disease (MD), and 
autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). Despite their use across these diseases, 
the rate of complete recovery remains low, and results across the literature 
demonstrates significant heterogeneity with respect to the effect of 
corticosteroids, suggesting a need to identify more efficacious treatment 
options. Previously, our group has cross-referenced steroid-responsive genes in 
the cochlea with published single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptome datasets 
to demonstrate that steroid-responsive differentially regulated genes are 
expressed in spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) and stria vascularis (SV) cell types. 
These differentially regulated genes represent potential druggable gene targets. 
We utilized multiple gene target databases (DrugBank, Pharos, and LINCS) to 
identify orally administered, FDA approved medications that potentially target 
these genes. We identified 42 candidate drugs that have been shown to interact 
with these genes, with an emphasis on safety profile, and tolerability. This 
study utilizes multiple databases to identify drugs that can target a number of 
druggable genes in otologic disorders that are commonly treated with steroids, 
providing a basis for establishing novel repurposing treatment trials.

The family of protein kinases comprises more than 500 genes involved in numerous 
functions. Hence, their physiological dysfunction has paved the way toward drug 
discovery for cancer, cardiovascular, and inflammatory diseases. As a matter of 
fact, Kinase binding sites high similarity has a double role. On the one hand it 
is a critical issue for selectivity, on the other hand, according to 
poly-pharmacology, a synergistic controlled effect on more than one target could 
be of great pharmacological interest. Another important aspect of binding 
similarity is the possibility of exploit it for repositioning of drugs on 
targets of the same family. In this study, we propose our approach called Kinase 
drUgs mAchine Learning frAmework (KUALA) to automatically identify kinase active 
ligands by using specific sets of molecular descriptors and provide a 
multi-target priority score and a repurposing threshold to suggest the best 
repurposable and non-repurposable molecules. The comprehensive list of all 
kinase-ligand pairs and their scores can be found at

Peptides play important roles in regulating biological processes and form the 
basis of a multiplicity of therapeutic drugs. To date, only about 300 peptides 
in human have confirmed bioactivity, although tens of thousands have been 
reported in the literature. The majority of these are inactive degradation 
products of endogenous proteins and peptides, presenting a needle-in-a-haystack 
problem of identifying the most promising candidate peptides from large-scale 
peptidomics experiments to test for bioactivity. To address this challenge, we 
conducted a comprehensive analysis of the mammalian peptidome across seven 
tissues in four different mouse strains and used the data to train a machine 
learning model that predicts hundreds of peptide candidates based on patterns in 
the mass spectrometry data. We provide in silico validation examples and 
experimental confirmation of bioactivity for two peptides, demonstrating the 
utility of this resource for discovering lead peptides for further 
characterization and therapeutic development.

Background: Liver cirrhosis is a life-threatening seqsuel of many chronic liver 
disorders of varying etiologies. In this study, we investigated protein targets 
of curcumin in liver cirrhosis based on a bioinformatics approach. Methods: 
Gene/protein associations with curcumin and liver cirrhosis were probed in 
drug−gene and gene−diseases databases including 
STITCH/DGIdb/DisGeNET/OMIM/DISEASES/CTD/Pharos and SwissTargetPrediction. 
Critical clustering groups (MCODE), hub candidates and critical hub genes in 
liver cirrhosis were identified, and connections between curcumin and liver 
cirrhosis-related genes were analyzed via Venn diagram. Interaction of hub genes 
with curcumin by molecular docking using PyRx-virtual screening tools was 
performed. Results: MCODE analysis indicated three MCODEs; the cluster (MCODE 1) 
comprised 79 nodes and 881 edges (score: 22.59). Curcumin database interactions 
recognized 318 protein targets. Liver cirrhosis genes and curcumin protein 
targets analysis demonstrated 96 shared proteins, suggesting that curcumin may 
influence 20 candidate and 13 hub genes, covering 81% of liver cirrhosis 
critical genes and proteins. Thirteen shared proteins affected oxidative stress 
regulation, RNA, telomerase activity, cell proliferation, and cell death. 
Molecular docking analysis showed the affinity of curcumin binding hub genes 
(Binding affinity: ΔG < −4.9 kcal/mol). Conclusions: Curcumin impacted on 
several critical liver cirrhosis genes mainly involved in extracellular matrix 
communication, focal adhesion, and the response to oxidative stress.

Opioid addiction (OA) is moderately heritable, yet only rs1799971, the A118G 
variant in OPRM1, has been identified as a genome-wide significant association 
with OA and independently replicated. We applied genomic structural equation 
modeling to conduct a GWAS of the new Genetics of Opioid Addiction Consortium 
(GENOA) data together with published studies (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 
Million Veteran Program, and Partners Health), comprising 23,367 cases and 
effective sample size of 88,114 individuals of European ancestry. Genetic 
correlations among the various OA phenotypes were uniformly high (rg > 0.9). We 
observed the strongest evidence to date for OPRM1: lead SNP rs9478500 
(p = 2.56 × 10-9). Gene-based analyses identified novel genome-wide significant 
associations with PPP6C and FURIN. Variants within these loci appear to be 
pleiotropic for addiction and related traits.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible 
for the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has shown a vast range 
of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic to life-threatening symptoms. To 
figure out the cause of this heterogeneity, studies demonstrated the trace of 
genetic diversities whether in the hosts or the virus itself. With this regard, 
this review provides a comprehensive overview of how host genetic such as those 
related to the entry of the virus, the immune-related genes, gender-related 
genes, disease-related genes, and also host epigenetic could influence the 
severity of COVID-19. Besides, the mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 
__leading to emerging of new variants__ per se affect the affinity of the virus 
to the host cells and enhance the immune escape capacity. The current review 
discusses these variants and also the latest data about vaccination 
effectiveness facing the most important variants.

Grouping residue variations in a protein according to their physicochemical 
properties allows a dimensionality reduction of all the possible substitutions 
in a variant with respect to the wild type. Here, by using a large dataset of 
proteins with disease-related and benign variations, as derived by merging 
Humsavar and ClinVar data, we investigate to which extent our physicochemical 
grouping procedure can help in determining whether patterns of variation types 
are related to specific groups of diseases and whether they occur in Pfam and/or 
InterPro gene domains. Here, we download 75,145 germline disease-related and 
benign variations of 3,605 genes, group them according to physicochemical 
categories and map them into Pfam and InterPro gene domains. Statistically 
validated analysis indicates that each cluster of genes associated to Mondo 
anatomical system categorizations is characterized by a specific variation 
pattern. Patterns identify specific Pfam and InterPro domain-Mondo category 
associations. Our data suggest that the association of variation patterns to 
Mondo categories is unique and may help in associating gene variants to genetic 
diseases. This work corroborates in a much larger data set previous observations 
from our group.

Big Data pervades nearly all areas of life sciences, yet the analysis of large 
integrated data sets remains a major challenge. Moreover, the field of life 
sciences is highly fragmented and, consequently, so is its data, knowledge, and 
standards. This, in turn, makes integrated data analysis and knowledge gathering 
across sub-fields a demanding task. At the same time, the integration of various 
research angles and data types is crucial for modelling the complexity of 
organisms and biological processes in a holistic manner. This is especially 
valid in the context of drug development and chemical safety assessment where 
computational methods can provide solutions for the urgent need of fast, 
effective, and sustainable approaches. At the same time, such computational 
methods require the development of methodologies suitable for an integrated and 
data centred Big Data view. Here we discuss Knowledge Graphs (KG) as a solution 
to a data centred analysis approach for drug and chemical development and safety 
assessment. KGs are knowledge bases, data analysis engines, and knowledge 
discovery systems all in one, allowing them to be used from simple data 
retrieval, over meta-analysis to complex predictive and knowledge discovery 
systems. Therefore, KGs have immense potential to advance the data centred 
approach, the re-usability, and informativity of data. Furthermore, they can 
improve the power of analysis, and the complexity of modelled processes, all 
while providing knowledge in a natively human understandable network data model.

Breast cancers (BrCas) that overexpress oncogenic tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 
are treated with HER2-targeting antibodies (such as trastuzumab) or 
small-molecule kinase inhibitors (such as lapatinib). However, most patients 
with metastatic HER2+ BrCa have intrinsic resistance and nearly all eventually 
become resistant to HER2-targeting therapy. Resistance to HER2-targeting drugs 
frequently involves transcriptional reprogramming associated with constitutive 
activation of different signaling pathways. We have investigated the role of 
CDK8/19 Mediator kinase, a regulator of transcriptional reprogramming, in the 
response of HER2+ BrCa to HER2-targeting drugs. CDK8 was in the top 1% of all 
genes ranked by correlation with shorter relapse-free survival among treated 
HER2+ BrCa patients. Selective CDK8/19 inhibitors (senexin B and SNX631) showed 
synergistic interactions with lapatinib and trastuzumab in a panel of HER2+ BrCa 
cell lines, overcoming and preventing resistance to HER2-targeting drugs. The 
synergistic effects were mediated in part through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and 
reduced by PI3K inhibition. Combination of HER2- and CDK8/19-targeting agents 
inhibited STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation at S727 and up-regulated tumor 
suppressor BTG2. The growth of xenograft tumors formed by lapatinib-sensitive or 
-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cells was partially inhibited by SNX631 alone and 
strongly suppressed by the combination of SNX631 and lapatinib, overcoming 
lapatinib resistance. These effects were associated with decreased tumor cell 
proliferation and altered recruitment of stromal components to the xenograft 
tumors. These results suggest potential clinical benefit of combining HER2- and 
CDK8/19-targeting drugs in the treatment of metastatic HER2+ BrCa.

Despite advances in pharmacology and neuroscience, the path to new medications 
for psychiatric disorders largely remains stagnated. Drug repurposing offers a 
more efficient pathway compared with de novo drug discovery with lower cost and 
less risk. Various computational approaches have been applied to mine the vast 
amount of biomedical data generated over recent decades. Among these methods, 
network-based drug repurposing stands out as a potent tool for the comprehension 
of multiple domains of knowledge considering the interactions or associations of 
various factors. Aligned well with the poly-pharmacology paradigm shift in drug 
discovery, network-based approaches offer great opportunities to discover 
repurposing candidates for complex psychiatric disorders. In this review, we 
present the potential of network-based drug repurposing in psychiatry focusing 
on the incentives for using network-centric repurposing, major network-based 
repurposing strategies and data resources, applications in psychiatry and 
challenges of network-based drug repurposing. This review aims to provide 
readers with an update on network-based drug repurposing in psychiatry. We 
expect the repurposing approach to become a pivotal tool in the coming years to 
battle debilitating psychiatric disorders.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease that 
strikes millions worldwide. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach based on 
network target to identify anti-AD compounds from Danshen. Network pharmacology 
and molecular docking were employed to establish the DS-AD network, which mainly 
involved apoptosis of neuron cells. Then network scoring was confirmed via 
Connectivity Map analysis. M308 (Danshenxinkun D) was an anti-AD candidate with 
a high score (p < 0.01). Furthermore, we conducted ex vivo experiments with 
H2O2-treated PC12 cells to verify the neuroprotective effect of Salvia 
miltiorrhiza-containing plasma (SMP), and UPLC-Q-TOF/MS and RT-qPCR were 
performed to demonstrate the anti-AD activity of M308 from SMP. Results revealed 
that SMP could enhance cell viability and level of acetylcholine. AO/EB staining 
and Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis showed that SMP 
significantly suppressed apoptosis, which may be due to anti-oxidative stress 
activity. Moreover, the effects of M308 and SMP on expressions of PSEN1, DRD2, 
and APP mRNA were consistent, and M308 can significantly reverse the expression 
of PSEN1 and DRD2 mRNA in H2O2-treated PC12 cells. The strategy based on the 
network could be employed to identify anti-AD compounds from Chinese herbs. 
Notably, M308 stands out as a promising anti-AD candidate for development.

The manifestation of intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity hinders the 
development of ubiquitous cancer treatments, thus requiring a tailored therapy 
for each cancer type. Specifically, the reprogramming of cellular metabolism has 
been identified as a source of potential drug targets. Drug discovery is a long 
and resource-demanding process aiming at identifying and testing compounds early 
in the drug development pipeline. While drug repurposing efforts (i.e., 
inspecting readily available approved drugs) can be supported by a mechanistic 
rationale, strategies to further reduce and prioritize the list of potential 
candidates are still needed to facilitate feasible studies. Although a variety 
of 'omics' data are widely gathered, a standard integration method with modeling 
approaches is lacking. For instance, flux balance analysis is a metabolic 
modeling technique that mainly relies on the stoichiometry of the metabolic 
network. However, exploring the network's topology typically neglects 
biologically relevant information. Here we introduce Transcriptomics-Informed 
Stoichiometric Modelling And Network analysis (TISMAN) in a recombinant 
innovation manner, allowing identification and validation of genes as targets 
for drug repurposing using glioblastoma as an exemplar.

BACKGROUND: Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are critical for drug repurposing 
and elucidation of drug mechanisms, and are manually curated by large databases, 
such as ChEMBL, BindingDB, DrugBank and DrugTargetCommons. However, the number 
of curated articles likely constitutes only a fraction of all the articles that 
contain experimentally determined DTIs. Finding such articles and extracting the 
experimental information is a challenging task, and there is a pressing need for 
systematic approaches to assist the curation of DTIs. To this end, we applied 
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to identify such 
articles. Because DTI data intimately depends on the type of assays used to 
generate it, we also aimed to incorporate functions to predict the assay format.
RESULTS: Our novel method identified 0.6 million articles (along with drug and 
protein information) which are not previously included in public DTI databases. 
Using 10-fold cross-validation, we obtained ~ 99% accuracy for identifying 
articles containing quantitative drug-target profiles. The F1 micro for the 
prediction of assay format is 88%, which leaves room for improvement in future 
studies.
CONCLUSION: The BERT model in this study is robust and the proposed pipeline can 
be used to identify previously overlooked articles containing quantitative DTIs. 
Overall, our method provides a significant advancement in machine-assisted DTI 
extraction and curation. We expect it to be a useful addition to drug mechanism 
discovery and repurposing.

The search for effective therapeutic targets in fields like regenerative 
medicine and cancer research has generated interest in cell fate reprogramming. 
This cellular reprogramming paradigm can drive cells to a desired target state 
from any initial state. However, methods for identifying reprogramming targets 
remain limited for biological systems that lack large sets of experimental data 
or a dynamical characterization. We present NETISCE, a novel computational tool 
for identifying cell fate reprogramming targets in static networks. In 
combination with machine learning algorithms, NETISCE estimates the attractor 
landscape and predicts reprogramming targets using signal flow analysis and 
feedback vertex set control, respectively. Through validations in studies of 
cell fate reprogramming from developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology, we 
show that NETISCE can predict previously identified cell fate reprogramming 
targets and identify potentially novel combinations of targets. NETISCE extends 
cell fate reprogramming studies to larger-scale biological networks without the 
need for full model parameterization and can be implemented by experimental and 
computational biologists to identify parts of a biological system relevant to 
the desired reprogramming task.

Human γ-globin is predominantly expressed in fetal liver erythroid cells during 
gestation from 2 nearly identical genes, HBG1 and HBG2, that are both 
perinatally silenced. Reactivation of these fetal genes in adult red blood cells 
can ameliorate many symptoms associated with the inherited β-globinopathies, 
sickle cell disease, and Cooley anemia. Although promising genetic strategies to 
reactivate the γ-globin genes to treat these diseases have been explored, there 
are significant barriers to their effective implementation worldwide; 
alternatively, pharmacological induction of γ-globin synthesis could readily 
reach the majority of affected individuals. In this study, we generated a CRISPR 
knockout library that targeted all erythroid genes for which prospective or 
actual therapeutic compounds already exist. By probing this library for genes 
that repress fetal hemoglobin (HbF), we identified several novel, potentially 
druggable, γ-globin repressors, including VHL and PTEN. We demonstrate that 
deletion of VHL induces HbF through activation of the HIF1α pathway and that 
deletion of PTEN induces HbF through AKT pathway stimulation. Finally, we show 
that small-molecule inhibitors of PTEN and EZH induce HbF in both healthy and 
β-thalassemic human primary erythroid cells.

We investigate the use of confidence scores to evaluate the accuracy of a given 
AlphaFold (AF2) protein model for drug discovery. Prediction of accuracy is 
improved by not considering confidence scores below 80 due to the effects of 
disorder. On a set of recent crystal structures, 95% are likely to have accurate 
folds. Conformational discordance in the training set has a much more 
significant effect on accuracy than sequence divergence. We propose criteria for 
models and residues that are possibly useful for virtual screening. Based on 
these criteria, AF2 provides models for half of understudied (dark) human 
proteins and two-thirds of residues in those models.

As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens human health globally, 
infectious disorders have become one of the most challenging problem for the 
medical community. Natural products (NP) have been a prolific source of 
antimicrobial agents with widely divergent structures and a range vast 
biological activities. A dataset comprising 618 articles, including 646 NP-based 
compounds from 672 species of natural sources with biological activities against 
21 infectious pathogens from five categories, was assembled through manual 
selection of published articles. These data were used to identify 268 NP-based 
compounds classified into ten groups, which were used for network pharmacology 
analysis to capture the most promising lead-compounds such as agelasine D, 
dicumarol, dihydroartemisinin and pyridomycin. The distribution of maximum 
Tanimoto scores indicated that compounds which inhibited parasites exhibited low 
diversity, whereas the chemistries inhibiting bacteria, fungi, and viruses 
showed more structural diversity. A total of 331 species of medicinal plants 
with compounds exhibiting antimicrobial activities were selected to classify the 
family sources. The family Asteraceae possesses various compounds against C. 
neoformans, the family Anacardiaceae has compounds against Salmonella typhi, the 
family Cucurbitacea against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the 
family Ancistrocladaceae against Plasmodium. This review summarizes currently 
available data on NP-based antimicrobials against refractory infections to 
provide information for further discovery of drugs and synthetic strategies for 
anti-infectious agents.

Target prioritization is essential for drug discovery and repositioning. 
Applying computational methods to analyze and process multi-omics data to find 
new drug targets is a practical approach for achieving this. Despite an 
increasing number of methods for generating datasets such as genomics, 
phenomics, and proteomics, attempts to integrate and mine such datasets remain 
limited in scope. Developing hybrid intelligence solutions that combine human 
intelligence in the scientific domain and disease biology with the ability to 
mine multiple databases simultaneously may help augment drug target discovery 
and identify novel drug-indication associations. We believe that integrating 
different data sources using a singular numerical scoring system in a hybrid 
intelligent framework could help to bridge these different omics layers and 
facilitate rapid drug target prioritization for studies in drug discovery, 
development or repositioning. Herein, we describe our prototype of the StarGazer 
pipeline which combines multi-source, multi-omics data with a novel target 
prioritization scoring system in an interactive Python-based Streamlit 
dashboard. StarGazer displays target prioritization scores for genes associated 
with 1844 phenotypic traits, and is available via 
https://github.com/AstraZeneca/StarGazer.

Numerous studies have focused on the molecular signaling pathways that govern 
the development and growth of lymphatics in the hopes of elucidating promising 
druggable targets. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are currently the largest 
family of membrane receptors targeted by FDA-approved drugs, but there remain 
many unexplored receptors, including orphan GPCRs with no known biological 
ligand or physiological function. Thus, we sought to illuminate the cadre of 
GPCRs expressed at high levels in lymphatic endothelial cells and identified 
four orphan receptors: GPRC5B, AGDRF5/GPR116, FZD8 and GPR61. Compared to blood 
endothelial cells, GPRC5B is the most abundant GPCR expressed in cultured human 
lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and in situ RNAscope shows high mRNA levels 
in lymphatics of mice. Using genetic engineering approaches in both zebrafish 
and mice, we characterized the function of GPRC5B in lymphatic development. 
Morphant gprc5b zebrafish exhibited failure of thoracic duct formation, and 
Gprc5b-/- mice suffered from embryonic hydrops fetalis and hemorrhage associated 
with subcutaneous edema and blood-filled lymphatic vessels. Compared to Gprc5+/+ 
littermate controls, Gprc5b-/- embryos exhibited attenuated developmental 
lymphangiogenesis. During the postnatal period, ~30% of Gprc5b-/- mice were 
growth-restricted or died prior to weaning, with associated attenuation of 
postnatal cardiac lymphatic growth. In cultured human primary LECs, expression 
of GPRC5B is required to maintain cell proliferation and viability. 
Collectively, we identify a novel role for the lymphatic-enriched orphan GPRC5B 
receptor in lymphangiogenesis of fish, mice and human cells. Elucidating the 
roles of orphan GPCRs in lymphatics provides new avenues for discovery of 
druggable targets to treat lymphatic-related conditions such as lymphedema and 
cancer.

Large-scale phenome-wide association studies performed using densely-phenotyped 
cohorts such as the UK Biobank (UKB), reveal many statistically robust 
gene-phenotype relationships for both clinical and continuous traits. Here, we 
present Gene-SCOUT, a tool used to identify genes with similar continuous trait 
fingerprints to a gene of interest. A fingerprint reflects the continuous traits 
identified to be statistically associated with a gene of interest based on 
multiple underlying rare variant genetic architectures. Similarities between 
genes are evaluated by the cosine similarity measure, to capture concordant 
effect directionality, elucidating clusters of genes in a high dimensional 
space. The underlying gene-biomarker population-scale association statistics 
were obtained from a gene-level rare variant collapsing analysis performed on 
over 1500 continuous traits using 394 692 UKB participant exomes, with 
additional metabolomic trait associations provided through Nightingale Health's 
recent study of 121 394 of these participants. We demonstrate that gene 
similarity estimates from Gene-SCOUT provide stronger enrichments for clinical 
traits compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we provide a fully interactive 
web-resource (http://genescout.public.cgr.astrazeneca.com) to explore the 
pre-calculated exome-wide similarities. This resource enables a user to examine 
the biological relevance of the most similar genes for Gene Ontology (GO) 
enrichment and UKB clinical trait enrichment statistics, as well as a detailed 
breakdown of the traits underpinning a given fingerprint.

The high complexity of the cellular architecture of the human inner ear and the 
inaccessibility for tissue biopsy hampers cellular and molecular analysis of 
inner ear disease. Sampling and analysis of perilymph may present an opportunity 
for improved diagnostics and understanding of human inner ear pathology. 
Analysis of the perilymph proteome from patients undergoing cochlear 
implantation was carried out revealing a multitude of proteins and patterns of 
protein composition that may enable characterisation of patients into subgroups. 
Based on existing data and databases, single proteins that are not present in 
the blood circulation were related to cells within the cochlea to allow 
prediction of which cells contribute to the individual perilymph proteome of the 
patients. Based on the results, we propose a human atlas of the cochlea. 
Finally, druggable targets within the perilymph proteome were identified. 
Understanding and modulating the human perilymph proteome will enable novel 
avenues to improve diagnosis and treatment of inner ear diseases.

Single-cell proteomics (SCP) has great potential to advance biomedical research 
and personalized medicine. The sensitivity of such measurements increases with 
low-flow separations (<100 nL/min) due to improved ionization efficiency, but 
the time required for sample loading, column washing, and regeneration in these 
systems can lead to low measurement throughput and inefficient utilization of 
the mass spectrometer. Herein, we developed a two-column liquid chromatography 
(LC) system that dramatically increases the throughput of label-free SCP using 
two parallel subsystems to multiplex sample loading, online desalting, analysis, 
and column regeneration. The integration of MS1-based feature matching increased 
proteome coverage when short LC gradients were used. The high-throughput LC 
system was reproducible between the columns, with a 4% difference in median 
peptide abundance and a median CV of 18% across 100 replicate analyses of a 
single-cell-sized peptide standard. An average of 621, 774, 952, and 1622 
protein groups were identified with total analysis times of 7, 10, 15, and 30 
min, corresponding to a measurement throughput of 206, 144, 96, and 48 samples 
per day, respectively. When applied to single HeLa cells, we identified nearly 
1000 protein groups per cell using 30 min cycles and 660 protein groups per cell 
for 15 min cycles. We explored the possibility of measuring cancer therapeutic 
targets with a pilot study comparing the K562 and Jurkat leukemia cell lines. 
This work demonstrates the feasibility of high-throughput label-free single-cell 
proteomics.

The scientific knowledge about which genes are involved in which diseases grows 
rapidly, which makes it difficult to keep up with new publications and genetics 
datasets. The DISEASES database aims to provide a comprehensive overview by 
systematically integrating and assigning confidence scores to evidence for 
disease-gene associations from curated databases, genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) and automatic text mining of the biomedical literature. Here, we 
present a major update to this resource, which greatly increases the number of 
associations from all these sources. This is especially true for the text-mined 
associations, which have increased by at least 9-fold at all confidence cutoffs. 
We show that this dramatic increase is primarily due to adding full-text 
articles to the text corpus, secondarily due to improvements to both the disease 
and gene dictionaries used for named entity recognition, and only to a very 
small extent due to the growth in number of PubMed abstracts. DISEASES now also 
makes use of a new GWAS database, Target Illumination by GWAS Analytics, which 
considerably increased the number of GWAS-derived disease-gene associations. 
DISEASES itself is also integrated into several other databases and resources, 
including GeneCards/MalaCards, Pharos/Target Central Resource Database and the 
Cytoscape stringApp. All data in DISEASES are updated on a weekly basis and is 
available via a web interface at https://diseases.jensenlab.org, from where it 
can also be downloaded under open licenses. Database URL:

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) or presbycusis is a prevalent condition 
associated with social isolation, cognitive impairment, and dementia. 
Age-related changes in the cochlea, the auditory portion of the inner ear, are 
the primary cause of ARHL. Unfortunately, there are currently no pharmaceutical 
approaches to treat ARHL. To examine the biological processes underlying 
age-related changes in the cochlea and identify candidate drugs for rapid 
repurposing to treat ARHL, we utilized bulk RNA sequencing to obtain 
transcriptomes from the functional substructures of the cochlea-the 
sensorineural structures, including the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion 
neurons (OC/SGN) and the stria vascularis and spiral ligament (SV/SL)-in young 
(6-week-old) and old (2-year-old) C57BL/6 mice. Transcriptomic analyses revealed 
both overlapping and unique patterns of gene expression and gene enrichment 
between substructures and with ageing. Based on these age-related 
transcriptional changes, we queried the protein products of genes differentially 
expressed with ageing in DrugBank and identified 27 FDA/EMA-approved drugs that 
are suitable to be repurposed to treat ARHL. These drugs target the protein 
products of genes that are differentially expressed with ageing uniquely in 
either the OC/SGN or SV/SL and that interrelate diverse biological processes. 
Further transcriptomic analyses revealed that most genes differentially 
expressed with ageing in both substructures encode protein products that are 
promising drug target candidates but are, nevertheless, not yet linked to 
approved drugs. Thus, with this study, we apply a novel approach to characterize 
the druggable genetic landscape for ARHL and propose a list of drugs to test in 
pre-clinical studies as potential treatment options for ARHL.

Sex differences are essential factors in disease etiology and manifestation in 
many diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration 
[33]. The biological influence of sex differences (including genomic, 
epigenetic, hormonal, immunological, and metabolic differences between males and 
females) and the lack of biomedical studies considering sex differences in their 
study design has led to several policies. For example, the National Institute of 
Health's (NIH) sex as a biological variable (SABV) and Sex and Gender Equity in 
Research (SAGER) policies to motivate researchers to consider sex differences 
[204]. However, drug repurposing, a promising alternative to traditional drug 
discovery by identifying novel uses for FDA-approved drugs, lacks sex-aware 
methods that can improve the identification of drugs that have sex-specific 
responses [7, 11, 14, 33]. Sex-aware drug repurposing methods either select drug 
candidates that are more efficacious in one sex or deprioritize drug candidates 
based on if they are predicted to cause a sex-bias adverse event (SBAE), 
unintended therapeutic effects that are more likely to occur in one sex. 
Computational drug repurposing methods are encouraging approaches to develop for 
sex-aware drug repurposing because they can prioritize sex-specific drug 
candidates or SBAEs at lower cost and time than traditional drug discovery. 
Sex-aware methods currently exist for clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic 
information [1, 7, 155]. They have not expanded to other data types, such as DNA 
variation, which has been beneficial in other drug repurposing methods that do 
not consider sex [114]. Additionally, some sex-aware methods suffer from poorer 
performance because a disproportionate number of male and female samples are 
available to train computational methods [7]. However, there is development 
potential for several different categories (i.e., data mining, ligand binding 
predictions, molecular associations, and networks). Low-dimensional 
representations of molecular association and network approaches are also 
especially promising candidates for future sex-aware drug repurposing 
methodologies because they reduce the multiple hypothesis testing burden and 
capture sex-specific variation better than the other methods [151, 159]. Here we 
review how sex influences drug response, the current state of drug repurposing 
including with respect to sex-bias drug response, and how model organism study 
design choices influence drug repurposing validation.

Protein interaction pathways and networks are critically-required for a vast 
range of biological processes. Improved discovery of candidate druggable 
proteins within specific cell, tissue and disease contexts will aid development 
of new treatments. Predicting protein interaction networks from gene expression 
data can provide valuable insights into normal and disease biology. For example, 
the resulting protein networks can be used to identify potentially druggable 
targets and drug candidates for testing in cell and animal disease models. The 
advent of whole-transcriptome expression profiling techniques-that catalogue 
protein-coding genes expressed within cells and tissues-has enabled development 
of individual algorithms for particular tasks. For example,: (i) gene ontology 
algorithms that predict gene/protein subsets involved in related cell processes; 
(ii) algorithms that predict intracellular protein interaction pathways; and 
(iii) algorithms that correlate druggable protein targets with known drugs 
and/or drug candidates. This review examines approaches, advantages and 
disadvantages of existing gene expression, gene ontology, and protein network 
prediction algorithms. Using this framework, we examine current efforts to 
combine these algorithms into pipelines to enable identification of druggable 
targets, and associated known drugs, using gene expression datasets. In doing 
so, new opportunities are identified for development of powerful algorithm 
pipelines, suitable for wide use by non-bioinformaticians, that can predict 
protein interaction networks, druggable proteins, and related drugs from user 
gene expression datasets.

Drug design is a complex pharmaceutical science with a long history. Many 
achievements have been made in the field of drug design since the end of 19th 
century, when Emil Fisher suggested that the drug-receptor interaction resembles 
the key and lock interplay. Gradually, drug design has been transformed into a 
coherent and well-organized science with a solid theoretical background and 
practical applications. Now, drug design is the most advanced approach for drug 
discovery. It utilizes the innovations in science and technology and includes 
them in its wide-ranging arsenal of methods and tools in order to achieve the 
main goal: discovery of effective, specific, non-toxic, safe and well-tolerated 
drugs. Drug design is one of the most intensively developing modern sciences and 
its progress is accelerated by the implication of artificial intelligence. The 
present review aims to capture some of the most important milestones in the 
development of drug design, to outline some of the most used current methods and 
to sketch the future perspective according to the author's point of view. 
Without pretending to cover fully the wide range of drug design topics, the 
review introduces the reader to the content of Molecules' Special Issue "Drug 
Design-Science and Practice".

By combining 6 druggable genome resources, we identify 6,083 genes as potential 
druggable genes (PDGs). We characterize their expression, recurrent genomic 
alterations, cancer dependencies, and therapeutic potentials by integrating 
genome, functionome, and druggome profiles across cancers. 81.5% of PDGs are 
reliably expressed in major adult cancers, 46.9% show selective expression 
patterns, and 39.1% exhibit at least one recurrent genomic alteration. We 
annotate a total of 784 PDGs as dependent genes for cancer cell growth. We 
further quantify 16 cancer-related features and estimate a PDG cancer drug 
target score (PCDT score). PDGs with higher PCDT scores are significantly 
enriched for genes encoding kinases and histone modification enzymes. 
Importantly, we find that a considerable portion of high PCDT score PDGs are 
understudied genes, providing unexplored opportunities for drug development in 
oncology. By integrating the druggable genome and the cancer genome, our study 
thus generates a comprehensive blueprint of potential druggable genes across 
cancers.

Nociceptors are specialized sensory neurons that detect damaging or potentially 
damaging stimuli and are found in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal 
ganglia. These neurons are critical for the generation of neuronal signals that 
ultimately create the perception of pain. Nociceptors are also primary targets 
for treating acute and chronic pain. Single-cell transcriptomics on mouse 
nociceptors has transformed our understanding of pain mechanisms. We sought to 
generate equivalent information for human nociceptors with the goal of 
identifying transcriptomic signatures of nociceptors, identifying species 
differences and potential drug targets. We used spatial transcriptomics to 
molecularly characterize transcriptomes of single DRG neurons from eight organ 
donors. We identified 12 clusters of human sensory neurons, 5 of which are C 
nociceptors, as well as 1 C low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), 1 Aβ 
nociceptor, 2 Aδ, 2 Aβ, and 1 proprioceptor subtypes. By focusing on expression 
profiles for ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and other 
pharmacological targets, we provided a rich map of potential drug targets in the 
human DRG with direct comparison to mouse sensory neuron transcriptomes. We also 
compared human DRG neuronal subtypes to nonhuman primates showing conserved 
patterns of gene expression among many cell types but divergence among specific 
nociceptor subsets. Last, we identified sex differences in human DRG 
subpopulation transcriptomes, including a marked increase in calcitonin-related 
polypeptide alpha (CALCA) expression in female pruritogen receptor-enriched 
nociceptors. This comprehensive spatial characterization of human nociceptors 
might open the door to development of better treatments for acute and chronic 
pain disorders.

In the event of an outbreak due to an emerging pathogen, time is of the essence 
to contain or to mitigate the spread of the disease. Drug repositioning is one 
of the strategies that has the potential to deliver therapeutics relatively 
quickly. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that integrating critical data 
resources to drive drug-repositioning studies, involving host-host, 
host-pathogen, and drug-target interactions, remains a time-consuming effort 
that translates to a delay in the development and delivery of a life-saving 
therapy. Here, we describe a workflow we designed for a semiautomated 
integration of rapidly emerging data sets that can be generally adopted in a 
broad network pharmacology research setting. The workflow was used to construct 
a COVID-19 focused multimodal network that integrates 487 host-pathogen, 63 278 
host-host protein, and 1221 drug-target interactions. The resultant Neo4j graph 
database named "Neo4COVID19" is made publicly accessible via a web interface and 
via API calls based on the Bolt protocol. Details for accessing the database are 
provided on a landing page (https://neo4covid19.ncats.io/). We believe that our 
Neo4COVID19 database will be a valuable asset to the research community and will 
catalyze the discovery of therapeutics to fight COVID-19.

With increased research funding for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related 
disorders across the globe, large amounts of data are being generated. Several 
studies employed machine learning methods to understand the ever-growing omics 
data to enhance early diagnosis, map complex disease networks, or uncover 
potential drug targets. We describe results based on a Target Central Resource 
Database protein knowledge graph and evidence paths transformed into vectors by 
metapath matching. We extracted features between specific genes and diseases, 
then trained and optimized our model using XGBoost, termed MPxgb(AD). To 
determine our MPxgb(AD) prediction performance, we examined the top twenty 
predicted genes through an experimental screening pipeline. Our analysis 
identified potential AD risk genes: FRRS1, CTRAM, SCGB3A1, FAM92B/CIBAR2, and 
TMEFF2. FRRS1 and FAM92B are considered dark genes, while CTRAM, SCGB3A1, and 
TMEFF2 are connected to TREM2-TYROBP, IL-1β-TNFα, and MTOR-APP AD-risk nodes, 
suggesting relevance to the pathogenesis of AD.

Fusion genes represent a class of attractive therapeutic targets. Thousands of 
fusion genes have been identified in patients with cancer, but the functional 
consequences and therapeutic implications of most of these remain largely 
unknown. Here, we develop a functional genomic approach that consists of 
efficient fusion reconstruction and sensitive cell viability and drug response 
assays. Applying this approach, we characterize ~100 fusion genes detected in 
patient samples of The Cancer Genome Atlas, revealing a notable fraction of 
low-frequency fusions with activating effects on tumor growth. Focusing on those 
in the RTK-RAS pathway, we identify a number of activating fusions that can 
markedly affect sensitivity to relevant drugs. Last, we propose an integrated, 
level-of-evidence classification system to prioritize gene fusions 
systematically. Our study reiterates the urgent clinical need to incorporate 
similar functional genomic approaches to characterize gene fusions, thereby 
maximizing the utility of gene fusions for precision oncology.

Despite progress in prostate cancer (PC) therapeutics, distant metastasis 
remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality from PC. Thus, there is growing 
recognition that preventing or delaying PC metastasis holds great potential for 
substantially improving patient outcomes. Here we show receptor-interacting 
protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) is a clinically actionable target for inhibiting PC 
metastasis. RIPK2 is amplified/gained in ~65% of lethal metastatic 
castration-resistant PC. Its overexpression is associated with disease 
progression and poor prognosis, and its genetic knockout substantially reduces 
PC metastasis. Multi-level proteomics analyses reveal that RIPK2 strongly 
regulates the stability and activity of c-Myc (a driver of metastasis), largely 
via binding to and activating mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), 
which we identify as a direct c-Myc-S62 kinase. RIPK2 inhibition by preclinical 
and clinical drugs inactivates the noncanonical RIPK2/MKK7/c-Myc pathway and 
effectively impairs PC metastatic outgrowth. These results support targeting 
RIPK2 signaling to extend metastasis-free and overall survival.

The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RSCB 
PDB) provides a wide range of digital data regarding biology and biomedicine. 
This huge internet resource involves a wide range of important biological data, 
obtained from experiments around the globe by different scientists. The 
Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) represents a brilliant collection of 3D 
structure data associated with important and vital biomolecules including 
nucleic acids (RNAs and DNAs) and proteins. Moreover, this database accumulates 
knowledge regarding function and evolution of biomacromolecules which supports 
different disciplines such as biotechnology. 3D structure, functional 
characteristics and phylogenetic properties of biomacromolecules give a deep 
understanding of the biomolecules' characteristics. An important advantage of 
the wwPDB database is the data updating time, which is done every week. This 
updating process helps users to have the newest data and information for their 
projects. The data and information in wwPDB can be a great support to have an 
accurate imagination and illustrations of the biomacromolecules in 
biotechnology. As demonstrated by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rapidly reliable and 
accessible biological data for microbiology, immunology, vaccinology, and drug 
development are critical to address many healthcare-related challenges that are 
facing humanity. The aim of this paper is to introduce the readers to wwPDB, and 
to highlight the importance of this database in biotechnology, with the 
expectation that the number of scientists interested in the utilization of 
Protein Data Bank's resources will increase substantially in the coming years.

The conventional drug discovery pipeline has proven to be unsustainable for rare 
diseases. Herein, we discuss recent advances in biomedical knowledge mining 
applied to discovering therapeutics for rare diseases. We summarize current 
chemogenomics data of relevance to rare diseases and provide a perspective on 
the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and biomedical knowledge graph mining 
in rare disease drug discovery. We illustrate the power of these methodologies 
using a chordoma case study. We expect that a broader application of knowledge 
graph mining and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches will expedite the 
discovery of viable drug candidates against both rare and common diseases.

Twenty years after the publication of the first draft of the human genome, our 
knowledge of the human proteome is still fragmented. The challenge of 
translating the wealth of new knowledge from genomics into new medicines is that 
proteins, and not genes, are the primary executers of biological function. 
Therefore, much of how biology works in health and disease must be understood 
through the lens of protein function. Accordingly, a subset of human proteins 
has been at the heart of research interests of scientists over the centuries, 
and we have accumulated varying degrees of knowledge about approximately 65% of 
the human proteome. Nevertheless, a large proportion of proteins in the human 
proteome (∼35%) remains uncharacterized, and less than 5% of the human proteome 
has been successfully targeted for drug discovery. This highlights the profound 
disconnect between our abilities to obtain genetic information and subsequent 
development of effective medicines. Target 2035 is an international federation 
of biomedical scientists from the public and private sectors, which aims to 
address this gap by developing and applying new technologies to create by year 
2035 chemogenomic libraries, chemical probes, and/or biological probes for the 
entire human proteome.

Integrating tumor heterogeneity in the drug discovery process is a key challenge 
to tackle breast cancer resistance. Identifying protein targets for functionally 
distinct tumor clones is particularly important to tailor therapy to the 
heterogeneous tumor subpopulations and achieve clonal theranostics. For this 
purpose, we performed an unsupervised, label-free, spatially resolved shotgun 
proteomics guided by MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) on 124 selected tumor 
clonal areas from early luminal breast cancers, tumor stroma, and breast cancer 
metastases. 2868 proteins were identified. The main protein classes found in the 
clonal proteome dataset were enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, membrane-traffic, 
translational or scaffold proteins, or transporters. As a comparison, 
gene-specific transcriptional regulators, chromatin related proteins or 
transmembrane signal receptor were more abundant in the TCGA dataset. Moreover, 
26 mutated proteins have been identified. Similarly, expanding the search to 
alternative proteins databases retrieved 126 alternative proteins in the clonal 
proteome dataset. Most of these alternative proteins were coded mainly from 
non-coding RNA. To fully understand the molecular information brought by our 
approach and its relevance to drug target discovery, the clonal proteomic 
dataset was further compared to the TCGA breast cancer database and two 
transcriptomic panels, BC360 (nanoString®) and CDx (Foundation One®). We 
retrieved 139 pathways in the clonal proteome dataset. Only 55% of these 
pathways were also present in the TCGA dataset, 68% in BC360 and 50% in CDx. 
Seven of these pathways have been suggested as candidate for drug targeting, 22 
have been associated with breast cancer in experimental or clinical reports, the 
remaining 19 pathways have been understudied in breast cancer. Among the 
anticancer drugs, 35 drugs matched uniquely with the clonal proteome dataset, 
with only 7 of them already approved in breast cancer. The number of target and 
drug interactions with non-anticancer drugs (such as agents targeting the 
cardiovascular system, metabolism, the musculoskeletal or the nervous systems) 
was higher in the clonal proteome dataset (540 interactions) compared to TCGA 
(83 interactions), BC360 (419 interactions), or CDx (172 interactions). Many of 
the protein targets identified and drugs screened were clinically relevant to 
breast cancer and are in clinical trials. Thus, we described the non-redundant 
knowledge brought by this clone-tailored approach compared to TCGA or 
transcriptomic panels, the targetable proteins identified in the clonal proteome 
dataset, and the potential of this approach for drug discovery and repurposing 
through drug interactions with antineoplastic agents and non-anticancer drugs.

BACKGROUND: LINCS, "Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures", 
and IDG, "Illuminating the Druggable Genome", are both NIH projects and 
consortia that have generated rich datasets for the study of the molecular basis 
of human health and disease. LINCS L1000 expression signatures provide unbiased 
systems/omics experimental evidence. IDG provides compiled and curated knowledge 
for illumination and prioritization of novel drug target hypotheses. Together, 
these resources can support a powerful new approach to identifying novel drug 
targets for complex diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which continues 
to inflict severe harm on human health, and resist traditional research 
approaches.
RESULTS: Integrating LINCS and IDG, we built the Knowledge Graph Analytics 
Platform (KGAP) to support an important use case: identification and 
prioritization of drug target hypotheses for associated diseases. The KGAP 
approach includes strong semantics interpretable by domain scientists and a 
robust, high performance implementation of a graph database and related 
analytical methods. Illustrating the value of our approach, we investigated 
results from queries relevant to PD. Approved PD drug indications from IDG's 
resource DrugCentral were used as starting points for evidence paths exploring 
chemogenomic space via LINCS expression signatures for associated genes, 
evaluated as target hypotheses by integration with IDG. The KG-analytic scoring 
function was validated against a gold standard dataset of genes associated with 
PD as elucidated, published mechanism-of-action drug targets, also from 
DrugCentral. IDG's resource TIN-X was used to rank and filter KGAP results for 
novel PD targets, and one, SYNGR3 (Synaptogyrin-3), was manually investigated 
further as a case study and plausible new drug target for PD.
CONCLUSIONS: The synergy of LINCS and IDG, via KG methods, empowers graph 
analytics methods for the investigation of the molecular basis of complex 
diseases, and specifically for identification and prioritization of novel drug 
targets. The KGAP approach enables downstream applications via integration with 
resources similarly aligned with modern KG methodology. The generality of the 
approach indicates that KGAP is applicable to many disease areas, in addition to 
PD, the focus of this paper.

Structural biologists provide direct insights into the molecular bases of human 
health and disease. The open-access Protein Data Bank (PDB) stores and delivers 
three-dimensional (3D) biostructure data that facilitate discovery and 
development of therapeutic agents and diagnostic tools. We are in the midst of a 
revolution in vaccinology. Non-infectious mRNA vaccines have been proven during 
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This new technology underpins 
nimble discovery and clinical development platforms that use knowledge of 3D 
viral protein structures for societal benefit. The RCSB PDB supports vaccine 
designers through expert biocuration and rigorous validation of 3D structures; 
open-access dissemination of structure information; and search, visualization, 
and analysis tools for structure-guided design efforts. This resource article 
examines the structural biology underpinning the success of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccines and enumerates 
some of the many protein structures in the PDB archive that could guide design 
of new countermeasures against existing and emerging viral pathogens.

Serine/threonine kinase 3 (STK3) is an essential member of the highly conserved 
Hippo tumor suppressor pathway that regulates Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) 
and TAZ. STK3 and its paralog STK4 initiate a phosphorylation cascade that 
regulates YAP1/TAZ inhibition and degradation, which is important for regulated 
cell growth and organ size. Deregulation of this pathway leads to 
hyperactivation of YAP1 in various cancers. Counter to the canonical tumor 
suppression role of STK3, we report that in the context of prostate cancer (PC), 
STK3 has a pro-tumorigenic role. Our investigation started with the observation 
that STK3, but not STK4, is frequently amplified in PC. Additionally, high STK3 
expression is associated with decreased overall survival and positively 
correlates with androgen receptor (AR) activity in metastatic castrate-resistant 
PC. XMU-MP-1, an STK3/4 inhibitor, slowed cell proliferation, spheroid growth, 
and Matrigel invasion in multiple models. Genetic depletion of STK3 decreased 
proliferation in several PC cell lines. In a syngeneic allograft model, STK3 
loss slowed tumor growth kinetics in vivo, and biochemical analysis suggests a 
mitotic growth arrest phenotype. To further probe the role of STK3 in PC, we 
identified and validated a new set of selective STK3 inhibitors, with enhanced 
kinase selectivity relative to XMU-MP-1, that inhibited tumor spheroid growth 
and invasion. Consistent with the canonical role, inhibition of STK3 induced 
cardiomyocyte growth and had chemoprotective effects. Our results indicate that 
STK3 has a non-canonical role in PC progression and that inhibition of STK3 may 
have a therapeutic potential for PC that merits further investigation.

The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) consortium is a National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) Common Fund program designed to enhance our knowledge of 
under-studied proteins, more specifically, proteins unannotated within the three 
most commonly drug-targeted protein families: G-protein coupled receptors, ion 
channels, and protein kinases. Since 2014, the IDG Knowledge Management Center 
(IDG-KMC) has generated several open-access datasets and resources that jointly 
serve as a highly translational machine-learning-ready knowledgebase focused on 
human protein-coding genes and their products. The goal of the IDG-KMC is to 
develop comprehensive integrated knowledge for the druggable genome to 
illuminate the uncharacterized or poorly annotated portion of the druggable 
genome. The tools derived from the IDG-KMC provide either user-friendly 
visualizations or ways to impute the knowledge about potential targets using 
machine learning strategies. In the following protocols, we describe how to use 
each web-based tool to accelerate illumination in under-studied proteins. © 2022

Specific protein-protein interactions are central to all processes that underlie 
cell physiology. Numerous studies have together identified hundreds of thousands 
of human protein-protein interactions. However, many interactions remain to be 
discovered, and low affinity, conditional, and cell type-specific interactions 
are likely to be disproportionately underrepresented. Here, we describe an 
optimized proteomic peptide-phage display library that tiles all disordered 
regions of the human proteome and allows the screening of ~ 1,000,000 
overlapping peptides in a single binding assay. We define guidelines for 
processing, filtering, and ranking the results and provide PepTools, a toolkit 
to annotate the identified hits. We uncovered >2,000 interaction pairs for 35 
known short linear motif (SLiM)-binding domains and confirmed the quality of the 
produced data by complementary biophysical or cell-based assays. Finally, we 
show how the amino acid resolution-binding site information can be used to 
pinpoint functionally important disease mutations and phosphorylation events in 
intrinsically disordered regions of the proteome. The optimized human 
disorderome library paired with PepTools represents a powerful pipeline for 
unbiased proteome-wide discovery of SLiM-based interactions.

Several molecular datasets have been recently compiled to characterize the 
activity of SARS-CoV-2 within human cells. Here we extend computational methods 
to integrate several different types of sequence, functional and interaction 
data to reconstruct networks and pathways activated by the virus in host cells. 
We identify key proteins in these networks and further intersect them with genes 
differentially expressed at conditions that are known to impact viral activity. 
Several of the top ranked genes do not directly interact with virus proteins. We 
experimentally tested treatments for a number of the predicted targets. We show 
that blocking one of the predicted indirect targets significantly reduces viral 
loads in stem cell-derived alveolar epithelial type II cells (iAT2s).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), oxidative stress (OS) is implicated in the 
neurodegenerative processes that occur from the beginning of the disease. 
Unchecked OS initiates a vicious circle caused by its crosstalk with 
inflammation, leading to demyelination, axonal damage and neuronal loss. The 
failure of MS antioxidant therapies relying on the use of endogenous and natural 
compounds drives the application of novel approaches to assess target relevance 
to the disease prior to preclinical testing of new drug candidates. To identify 
drugs that can act as regulators of intracellular oxidative homeostasis, we 
applied an in silico approach that links genome-wide MS associations and 
molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to proteins of the OS pathway. We found 
10 drugs with both central nervous system and oral bioavailability, targeting 
five out of the 21 top-scoring hits, including arginine methyltransferase 
(CARM1), which was first linked to MS. In particular, the direction of brain 
expression QTLs for CARM1 and protein kinase MAPK1 enabled us to select BIIB021 
and PEITC drugs with the required target modulation. Our study highlights 
OS-related molecules regulated by functional MS variants that could be targeted 
by existing drugs as a supplement to the approved disease-modifying treatments.

Advances in biomedicine are largely fueled by exploring uncharted territories of 
human biology. Machine learning can both enable and accelerate discovery, but 
faces a fundamental hurdle when applied to unseen data with distributions that 
differ from previously observed ones-a common dilemma in scientific inquiry. We 
have developed a new deep learning framework, called Portal Learning, to explore 
dark chemical and biological space. Three key, novel components of our approach 
include: (i) end-to-end, step-wise transfer learning, in recognition of 
biology's sequence-structure-function paradigm, (ii) out-of-cluster 
meta-learning, and (iii) stress model selection. Portal Learning provides a 
practical solution to the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in statistical 
machine learning. Here, we have implemented Portal Learning to predict 
chemical-protein interactions on a genome-wide scale. Systematic studies 
demonstrate that Portal Learning can effectively assign ligands to unexplored 
gene families (unknown functions), versus existing state-of-the-art methods. 
Compared with AlphaFold2-based protein-ligand docking, Portal Learning 
significantly improved the performance by 79% in PR-AUC and 27% in ROC-AUC, 
respectively. The superior performance of Portal Learning allowed us to target 
previously "undruggable" proteins and design novel polypharmacological agents 
for disrupting interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Portal 
Learning is general-purpose and can be further applied to other areas of 
scientific inquiry.

MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies can reveal important 
genotype-phenotype associations; however, data quality and interpretability 
issues must be addressed. For drug discovery scientists seeking to prioritize 
targets based on the available evidence, these issues go beyond the single 
study.
RESULTS: Here, we describe rational ranking, filtering and interpretation of 
inferred gene-trait associations and data aggregation across studies by 
leveraging existing curation and harmonization efforts. Each gene-trait 
association is evaluated for confidence, with scores derived solely from 
aggregated statistics, linking a protein-coding gene and phenotype. We propose a 
method for assessing confidence in gene-trait associations from evidence 
aggregated across studies, including a bibliometric assessment of scientific 
consensus based on the iCite relative citation ratio, and meanRank scores, to 
aggregate multivariate evidence.This method, intended for drug target hypothesis 
generation, scoring and ranking, has been implemented as an analytical pipeline, 
available as open source, with public datasets of results, and a web application 
designed for usability by drug discovery scientists.

The FDA approval of imatinib in 2001 was a breakthrough in molecularly targeted 
cancer therapy and heralded the emergence of kinase inhibitors as a key drug 
class in the oncology area and beyond. Twenty years on, this article analyses 
the landscape of approved and investigational therapies that target kinases and 
trends within it, including the most popular targets of kinase inhibitors and 
their expanding range of indications. There are currently 71 small-molecule 
kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) approved by the FDA and an additional 16 SMKIs 
approved by other regulatory agencies. Although oncology is still the 
predominant area for their application, there have been important approvals for 
indications such as rheumatoid arthritis, and one-third of the SMKIs in clinical 
development address disorders beyond oncology. Information on clinical trials of 
SMKIs reveals that approximately 110 novel kinases are currently being explored 
as targets, which together with the approximately 45 targets of approved kinase 
inhibitors represent only about 30% of the human kinome, indicating that there 
are still substantial unexplored opportunities for this drug class. We also 
discuss trends in kinase inhibitor design, including the development of 
allosteric and covalent inhibitors, bifunctional inhibitors and chemical 
degraders.

Understanding relationships between spontaneous cancer in companion (pet) 
canines and humans can facilitate biomarker and drug development in both 
species. Towards this end we developed an experimental-bioinformatic protocol 
that analyzes canine transcriptomics data in the context of existing human data 
to evaluate comparative relevance of canine to human cancer. We used this 
protocol to characterize five canine cancers: melanoma, osteosarcoma, pulmonary 
carcinoma, B- and T-cell lymphoma, in 60 dogs. We applied an unsupervised, 
iterative clustering method that yielded five co-expression modules and found 
that each cancer exhibited a unique module expression profile. We constructed 
cancer models based on the co-expression modules and used the models to 
successfully classify the canine data. These canine-derived models also 
successfully classified human tumors representing the same cancers, indicating 
shared cancer biology between canines and humans. Annotation of the module genes 
identified cancer specific pathways relevant to cells-of-origin and tumor 
biology. For example, annotations associated with melanin production (PMEL, 
GPNMB, and BACE2), synthesis of bone material (COL5A2, COL6A3, and COL12A1), 
synthesis of pulmonary surfactant (CTSH, LPCAT1, and NAPSA), ribosomal proteins 
(RPL8, RPS7, and RPLP0), and epigenetic regulation (EDEM1, PTK2B, and JAK1) were 
unique to melanoma, osteosarcoma, pulmonary carcinoma, B- and T-cell lymphoma, 
respectively. In total, 152 biomarker candidates were selected from highly 
expressing modules for each cancer type. Many of these biomarker candidates are 
under-explored as drug discovery targets and warrant further study. The 
demonstrated transferability of classification models from canines to humans 
enforces the idea that tumor biology, biomarker targets, and associated 
therapeutics, discovered in canines, may translate to human medicine.

BACKGROUND: Protein kinases are among the largest druggable family of signaling 
proteins, involved in various human diseases, including cancers and 
neurodegenerative disorders. Despite their clinical relevance, nearly 30% of the 
545 human protein kinases remain highly understudied. Comparative genomics is a 
powerful approach for predicting and investigating the functions of understudied 
kinases. However, an incomplete knowledge of kinase orthologs across fully 
sequenced kinomes severely limits the application of comparative genomics 
approaches for illuminating understudied kinases. Here, we introduce KinOrtho, a 
query- and graph-based orthology inference method that combines full-length and 
domain-based approaches to map one-to-one kinase orthologs across 17 thousand 
species.
RESULTS: Using multiple metrics, we show that KinOrtho performed better than 
existing methods in identifying kinase orthologs across evolutionarily divergent 
species and eliminated potential false positives by flagging sequences without a 
proper kinase domain for further evaluation. We demonstrate the advantage of 
using domain-based approaches for identifying domain fusion events, highlighting 
a case between an understudied serine/threonine kinase TAOK1 and a metabolic 
kinase PIK3C2A with high co-expression in human cells. We also identify 
evolutionary fission events involving the understudied OBSCN kinase domains, 
further highlighting the value of domain-based orthology inference approaches. 
Using KinOrtho-defined orthologs, Gene Ontology annotations, and machine 
learning, we propose putative biological functions of several understudied 
kinases, including the role of TP53RK in cell cycle checkpoint(s), the 
involvement of TSSK3 and TSSK6 in acrosomal vesicle localization, and potential 
functions for the ULK4 pseudokinase in neuronal development.
CONCLUSIONS: In sum, KinOrtho presents a novel query-based tool to identify 
one-to-one orthologous relationships across thousands of proteomes that can be 
applied to any protein family of interest. We exploit KinOrtho here to identify 
kinase orthologs and show that its well-curated kinome ortholog set can serve as 
a valuable resource for illuminating understudied kinases, and the KinOrtho 
framework can be extended to any protein-family of interest.

The endocochlear potential (EP) generated by the stria vascularis (SV) is 
necessary for hair cell mechanotransduction in the mammalian cochlea. We sought 
to create a model of EP dysfunction for the purposes of transcriptional analysis 
and treatment testing. By administering a single dose of cisplatin, a commonly 
prescribed cancer treatment drug with ototoxic side effects, to the adult mouse, 
we acutely disrupt EP generation. By combining these data with single cell 
RNA-sequencing findings, we identify transcriptional changes induced by 
cisplatin exposure, and by extension transcriptional changes accompanying EP 
reduction, in the major cell types of the SV. We use these data to identify gene 
regulatory networks unique to cisplatin treated SV, as well as the 
differentially expressed and druggable gene targets within those networks. Our 
results reconstruct transcriptional responses that occur in gene expression on 
the cellular level while identifying possible targets for interventions not only 
in cisplatin ototoxicity but also in EP dysfunction.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promote immunosuppressive activities in 
the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in increased tumor burden and 
diminishing the anti-tumor response of immunotherapies. While primary and 
metastatic tumors are typically the focal points of therapeutic development, the 
immune cells of the TME are differentially programmed by the tissue of the 
metastatic site. In particular, MDSCs are programmed uniquely within different 
organs in the context of tumor progression. Given that MDSC plasticity is shaped 
by the surrounding environment, the proteomes of MDSCs from different metastatic 
sites are hypothesized to be unique. A bottom-up proteomics approach using 
sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) was 
used to quantify the proteome of CD11b+ cells derived from murine liver 
metastases (LM) and lung metastases (LuM). A comparative proteomics workflow was 
employed to compare MDSC proteins from LuM (LuM-MDSC) and LM (LM-MDSC) while 
also elucidating common signaling pathways, protein function, and possible 
drug-protein interactions. SWATH-MS identified 2516 proteins from 200 µg of 
sample. Of the 2516 proteins, 2367 have matching transcriptomic data. 
Upregulated proteins from lung and liver-derived murine CD11b+ cells with 
matching mRNA transcriptomic data were categorized based on target knowledge and 
level of drug development. Comparative proteomic analysis demonstrates that 
liver and lung tumor-derived MDSCs have distinct proteomes that may be subject 
to pharmacologic manipulation.

Broad-based cognitive deficits are an enduring and disabling symptom for many 
patients with severe mental illness, and these impairments are inadequately 
addressed by current medications. While novel drug targets for schizophrenia and 
depression have emerged from recent large-scale genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) of these psychiatric disorders, GWAS of general cognitive ability can 
suggest potential targets for nootropic drug repurposing. Here, we (1) 
meta-analyze results from two recent cognitive GWAS to further enhance power for 
locus discovery; (2) employ several complementary transcriptomic methods to 
identify genes in these loci that are credibly associated with cognition; and 
(3) further annotate the resulting genes using multiple chemoinformatic 
databases to identify "druggable" targets. Using our meta-analytic data set 
(N = 373,617), we identified 241 independent cognition-associated loci (29 
novel), and 76 genes were identified by 2 or more methods of gene 
identification. Actin and chromatin binding gene sets were identified as novel 
pathways that could be targeted via drug repurposing. Leveraging our 
transcriptomic and chemoinformatic databases, we identified 16 putative genes 
targeted by existing drugs potentially available for cognitive repurposing.

In 2005, the NIH Molecular Libraries Program (MLP) undertook the identification 
of tool compounds to expand biological insights, now termed small-molecule 
chemical probes. This inspired other organisations to initiate similar efforts 
from 2010 onwards. As a central focus of the Probes & Drugs portal (P&D), we 
have standardised, integrated and compared sets of declared probe compounds 
harvested from 12 different sources. This turned out to be challenging and 
revealed unexpected anomalies. Results in this work address key questions 
including; a) individual and total structure counts, b) overlaps between 
sources, c) comparisons with selected PubChem sources and d) investigating the 
probe coverage of druggable targets. In addition, we developed new high-level 
scoring schemes to filter collections down to probes of higher quality. This 
generated 548 high-quality chemical probes (HQCP) covering 447 distinct protein 
targets. This HQCP collection has been added to the P&D portal and will be 
regularly updated as established sources expand and new ones release data.

We have used three established human glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines-U87MG, A172, 
and T98G-as cellular systems to examine the plasticity of the drug-induced GBM 
cell phenotype, focusing on two clinical drugs, the phosphodiesterase PDE10A 
inhibitor Mardepodect and the multi-kinase inhibitor Regorafenib, using 
genome-wide drug-induced gene expression (DIGEX) to examine the drug response. 
Both drugs upregulate genes encoding specific growth factors, transcription 
factors, cellular signaling molecules, and cell surface proteins, while 
downregulating a broad range of targetable cell cycle and apoptosis-associated 
genes. A few upregulated genes encode therapeutic targets already addressed by 
FDA approved drugs, but the majority encode targets for which there are no 
approved drugs. Amongst the latter, we identify many novel druggable targets 
that could qualify for chemistry-led drug discovery campaigns. We also observe 
several highly upregulated transmembrane proteins suitable for combined drug, 
immunotherapy, and RNA vaccine approaches. DIGEX is a powerful way of 
visualizing the complex drug response networks emerging during GBM drug 
treatment, defining a phenotypic landscape which offers many new diagnostic and 
therapeutic opportunities. Nevertheless, the extreme heterogeneity we observe 
within drug-treated cells using this technique suggests that effective pan-GBM 
drug treatment will remain a significant challenge for many years to come.

Genome-wide association analysis allows the identification of potential 
candidate genes involved in the development of severe coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). Hence, it seems that genetics matters here, as well. Nevertheless, 
the virus's nature, including its RNA structure, determines the rate of 
mutations leading to new viral strains with all epidemiological and clinical 
consequences. Given these observations, we herein comment on the current 
hypotheses about the possible role of the genes in association with COVID-19 
severity. We discuss some of the major candidate genes that have been identified 
as potential genetic factors associated with the COVID-19 severity and infection 
susceptibility: HLA, ABO, ACE2, TLR7, ApoE, TYK2, OAS, DPP9, IFNAR2, CCR2, etc. 
Further study of genes and genetic variants will be of great benefit for the 
prevention and assessment of the individual risk and disease severity in 
different populations. These scientific data will serve as a basis for the 
development of clinically applicable diagnostic and prognostic tests for 
patients at high risk of COVID-19.

Despite decades of intensive search for compounds that modulate the activity of 
particular protein targets, a large proportion of the human kinome remains as 
yet undrugged. Effective approaches are therefore required to map the massive 
space of unexplored compound-kinase interactions for novel and potent 
activities. Here, we carry out a crowdsourced benchmarking of predictive 
algorithms for kinase inhibitor potencies across multiple kinase families tested 
on unpublished bioactivity data. We find the top-performing predictions are 
based on various models, including kernel learning, gradient boosting and deep 
learning, and their ensemble leads to a predictive accuracy exceeding that of 
single-dose kinase activity assays. We design experiments based on the model 
predictions and identify unexpected activities even for under-studied kinases, 
thereby accelerating experimental mapping efforts. The open-source prediction 
algorithms together with the bioactivities between 95 compounds and 295 kinases 
provide a resource for benchmarking prediction algorithms and for extending the 
druggable kinome.

We present PhenCards ( https://phencards.org ), a database and web server 
intended as a one-stop shop for previously disconnected biomedical knowledge 
related to human clinical phenotypes. Users can query human phenotype terms or 
clinical notes. PhenCards obtains relevant disease/phenotype prevalence and 
co-occurrence, drug, procedural, pathway, literature, grant, and collaborator 
data. PhenCards recommends the most probable genetic diseases and candidate 
genes based on phenotype terms from clinical notes. PhenCards facilitates 
exploration of phenotype, e.g., which drugs cause or are prescribed for patient 
symptoms, which genes likely cause specific symptoms, and which comorbidities 
co-occur with phenotypes.

A large number of GPCRs are potentially valuable drug targets but remain 
understudied. Many of these lack well-validated activating ligands and are 
considered "orphan" receptors, and G protein coupling profiles have not been 
defined for many orphan GPCRs. Here we asked if constitutive receptor activity 
can be used to determine G protein coupling profiles of orphan GPCRs. We 
monitored nucleotide-sensitive interactions between 48 understudied orphan GPCRs 
and five G proteins (240 combinations) using bioluminescence resonance energy 
transfer (BRET). No receptor ligands were used, but GDP was used as a common G 
protein ligand to disrupt receptor-G protein complexes. Constitutive BRET 
between the same receptors and β-arrestins was also measured. We found 
sufficient GDP-sensitive BRET to generate G protein coupling profiles for 22 of 
the 48 receptors we studied. Altogether we identified 48 coupled receptor-G 
protein pairs, many of which have not been described previously. We conclude 
that receptor-G protein complexes that form spontaneously in the absence of 
guanine nucleotides can be used to profile G protein coupling of 
constitutively-active GPCRs. This approach may prove useful for studying G 
protein coupling of other GPCRs for which activating ligands are not available.

The malignant phenotype of tumour cells is fuelled by changes in the expression 
of various transcription factors, including some of the well-studied proteins 
such as p53 and Myc. Despite significant progress made, little is known about 
several other transcription factors, including ELF4, and how they help shape the 
oncogenic processes in cancer cells. To this end, we performed a bioinformatics 
analysis to facilitate a detailed understanding of how the expression variations 
of ELF4 in human cancers are related to disease outcomes and the cancer cell 
drug responses. Here, using ELF4 mRNA expression data of 9,350 samples from the 
Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer project, we identify two groups of patient's 
tumours: those that expressed high ELF4 transcripts and those that expressed low 
ELF4 transcripts across 32 different human cancers. We uncover that patients 
segregated into these two groups are associated with different clinical 
outcomes. Further, we find that tumours that express high ELF4 mRNA levels tend 
to be of a higher-grade, afflict a significantly older patient population and 
have a significantly higher mutation burden. By analysing dose-response profiles 
to 397 anti-cancer drugs of 612 well-characterised human cancer cell lines, we 
discover that cell lines that expressed high ELF4 mRNA transcript are 
significantly less responsive to 129 anti-cancer drugs, and only significantly 
more response to three drugs: dasatinib, WH-4-023, and Ponatinib, all of which 
remarkably target the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase SRC and 
tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1. Collectively our analyses have shown that, across 
the 32 different human cancers, the patients afflicted with tumours that 
overexpress ELF4 tended to have a more aggressive disease that is also is more 
likely more refractory to most anti-cancer drugs, a finding upon which we could 
devise novel categorisation of patient tumours, treatment, and prognostic 
strategies.

Drug development involves a deep understanding of the mechanisms of action and 
possible side effects of each drug, and sometimes results in the identification 
of new and unexpected uses for drugs, termed as drug repurposing. Both in case 
of serendipitous observations and systematic mechanistic explorations, 
confirmation of new indications for a drug requires hypothesis building around 
relevant drug-related data, such as molecular targets involved, and patient and 
cellular responses. These datasets are available in public repositories, but 
apart from sifting through the sheer amount of data imposing computational 
bottleneck, a major challenge is the difficulty in selecting which databases to 
use from an increasingly large number of available databases. The database 
selection is made harder by the lack of an overview of the types of data offered 
in each database. In order to alleviate these problems and to guide the end user 
through the drug repurposing efforts, we provide here a survey of 102 of the 
most promising and drug-relevant databases reported to date. We summarize the 
target coverage and types of data available in each database and provide several 
examples of how multi-database exploration can facilitate drug repurposing.

Members of the human Zyxin family are LIM domain-containing proteins that 
perform critical cellular functions and are indispensable for cellular 
integrity. Despite their importance, not much is known about their structure, 
functions, interactions and dynamics. To provide insights into these, we used a 
set of in-silico tools and databases and analyzed their amino acid sequence, 
phylogeny, post-translational modifications, structure-dynamics, molecular 
interactions, and functions. Our analysis revealed that zyxin members are 
ohnologs. Presence of a conserved nuclear export signal composed of 
LxxLxL/LxxxLxL consensus sequence, as well as a possible nuclear localization 
signal, suggesting that Zyxin family members may have nuclear and cytoplasmic 
roles. The molecular modeling and structural analysis indicated that Zyxin 
family LIM domains share similarities with transcriptional regulators and have 
positively charged electrostatic patches, which may indicate that they have 
previously unanticipated nucleic acid binding properties. Intrinsic dynamics 
analysis of Lim domains suggest that only Lim1 has similar internal dynamics 
properties, unlike Lim2/3. Furthermore, we analyzed protein expression and 
mutational frequency in various malignancies, as well as mapped protein-protein 
interaction networks they are involved in. Overall, our comprehensive 
bioinformatic analysis suggests that these proteins may play important roles in 
mediating protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions.

Host-mediated lung inflammation is present1, and drives mortality2, in the 
critical illness caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Host genetic 
variants associated with critical illness may identify mechanistic targets for 
therapeutic development3. Here we report the results of the GenOMICC (Genetics 
Of Mortality In Critical Care) genome-wide association study in 2,244 critically 
ill patients with COVID-19 from 208 UK intensive care units. We have identified 
and replicated the following new genome-wide significant associations: on 
chromosome 12q24.13 (rs10735079, P = 1.65 × 10-8) in a gene cluster that encodes 
antiviral restriction enzyme activators (OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3); on chromosome 
19p13.2 (rs74956615, P = 2.3 × 10-8) near the gene that encodes tyrosine kinase 
2 (TYK2); on chromosome 19p13.3 (rs2109069, P = 3.98 ×  10-12) within the gene 
that encodes dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9); and on chromosome 21q22.1 
(rs2236757, P = 4.99 × 10-8) in the interferon receptor gene IFNAR2. We 
identified potential targets for repurposing of licensed medications: using 
Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that low expression of IFNAR2, or 
high expression of TYK2, are associated with life-threatening disease; and 
transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue revealed that high expression of 
the monocyte-macrophage chemotactic receptor CCR2 is associated with severe 
COVID-19. Our results identify robust genetic signals relating to key host 
antiviral defence mechanisms and mediators of inflammatory organ damage in 
COVID-19. Both mechanisms may be amenable to targeted treatment with existing 
drugs. However, large-scale randomized clinical trials will be essential before 
any change to clinical practice.

The task of predicting the interactions between drugs and targets plays a key 
role in the process of drug discovery. There is a need to develop novel and 
efficient prediction approaches in order to avoid costly and laborious yet 
not-always-deterministic experiments to determine drug-target interactions 
(DTIs) by experiments alone. These approaches should be capable of identifying 
the potential DTIs in a timely manner. In this article, we describe the data 
required for the task of DTI prediction followed by a comprehensive catalog 
consisting of machine learning methods and databases, which have been proposed 
and utilized to predict DTIs. The advantages and disadvantages of each set of 
methods are also briefly discussed. Lastly, the challenges one may face in 
prediction of DTI using machine learning approaches are highlighted and we 
conclude by shedding some lights on important future research directions.

The Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb, www.dgidb.org) is a web resource that 
provides information on drug-gene interactions and druggable genes from 
publications, databases, and other web-based sources. Drug, gene, and 
interaction data are normalized and merged into conceptual groups. The 
information contained in this resource is available to users through a 
straightforward search interface, an application programming interface (API), 
and TSV data downloads. DGIdb 4.0 is the latest major version release of this 
database. A primary focus of this update was integration with crowdsourced 
efforts, leveraging the Drug Target Commons for community-contributed 
interaction data, Wikidata to facilitate term normalization, and export to NDEx 
for drug-gene interaction network representations. Seven new sources have been 
added since the last major version release, bringing the total number of sources 
included to 41. Of the previously aggregated sources, 15 have been updated. 
DGIdb 4.0 also includes improvements to the process of drug normalization and 
grouping of imported sources. Other notable updates include the introduction of 
a more sophisticated Query Score for interaction search results, an updated 
Interaction Score, the inclusion of interaction directionality, and several 
additional improvements to search features, data releases, licensing 
documentation and the application framework.

The Open Targets Platform (https://www.targetvalidation.org/) provides users 
with a queryable knowledgebase and user interface to aid systematic target 
identification and prioritisation for drug discovery based upon underlying 
evidence. It is publicly available and the underlying code is open source. Since 
our last update two years ago, we have had 10 releases to maintain and 
continuously improve evidence for target-disease relationships from 20 different 
data sources. In addition, we have integrated new evidence from key datasets, 
including prioritised targets identified from genome-wide CRISPR knockout 
screens in 300 cancer models (Project Score), and GWAS/UK BioBank statistical 
genetic analysis evidence from the Open Targets Genetics Portal. We have evolved 
our evidence scoring framework to improve target identification. To aid the 
prioritisation of targets and inform on the potential impact of modulating a 
given target, we have added evaluation of post-marketing adverse drug reactions 
and new curated information on target tractability and safety. We have also 
developed the user interface and backend technologies to improve performance and 
usability. In this article, we describe the latest enhancements to the Platform, 
to address the fundamental challenge that developing effective and safe drugs is 
difficult and expensive.

In 2014, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiated the Illuminating the 
Druggable Genome (IDG) program to identify and improve our understanding of 
poorly characterized proteins that can potentially be modulated using small 
molecules or biologics. Two resources produced from these efforts are: The 
Target Central Resource Database (TCRD) (http://juniper.health.unm.edu/tcrd/) 
and Pharos (https://pharos.nih.gov/), a web interface to browse the TCRD. The 
ultimate goal of these resources is to highlight and facilitate research into 
currently understudied proteins, by aggregating a multitude of data sources, and 
ranking targets based on the amount of data available, and presenting data in 
machine learning ready format. Since the 2017 release, both TCRD and Pharos have 
produced two major releases, which have incorporated or expanded an additional 
25 data sources. Recently incorporated data types include human and viral-human 
protein-protein interactions, protein-disease and protein-phenotype 
associations, and drug-induced gene signatures, among others. These aggregated 
data have enabled us to generate new visualizations and content sections in 
Pharos, in order to empower users to find new areas of study in the druggable 
genome.

DrugCentral is a public resource (http://drugcentral.org) that serves the 
scientific community by providing up-to-date drug information, as described in 
previous papers. The current release includes 109 newly approved (October 2018 
through March 2020) active pharmaceutical ingredients in the US, Europe, Japan 
and other countries; and two molecular entities (e.g. mefuparib) of interest for 
COVID19. New additions include a set of pharmacokinetic properties for ∼1000 
drugs, and a sex-based separation of side effects, processed from FAERS (FDA 
Adverse Event Reporting System); as well as a drug repositioning prioritization 
scheme based on the market availability and intellectual property rights forFDA 
approved drugs. In the context of the COVID19 pandemic, we also incorporated 
REDIAL-2020, a machine learning platform that estimates anti-SARS-CoV-2 
activities, as well as the 'drugs in news' feature offers a brief enumeration of 
the most interesting drugs at the present moment. The full database dump and 
data files are available for download from the DrugCentral web portal.

Kinases form the backbone of numerous cell signaling pathways, with their 
dysfunction similarly implicated in multiple pathologies. Further facilitated by 
their druggability, kinases are a major focus of therapeutic development efforts 
in diseases such as cancer, infectious disease and autoimmune disorders. While 
their importance is clear, the role or biological function of nearly one-third 
of kinases is largely unknown. Here, we describe a data resource, the Dark 
Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK; https://darkkinome.org), that is specifically focused 
on providing data and reagents for these understudied kinases to the broader 
research community. Supported through NIH's Illuminating the Druggable Genome 
(IDG) Program, the DKK is focused on data and knowledge generation for 162 
poorly studied or 'dark' kinases. Types of data provided through the DKK include 
parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) peptides for quantitative proteomics, protein 
interactions, NanoBRET reagents, and kinase-specific compounds. Higher-level 
data is similarly being generated and consolidated such as tissue gene 
expression profiles and, longer-term, functional relationships derived through 
perturbation studies. Associated web tools that help investigators interrogate 
both internal and external data are also provided through the site. As an 
evolving resource, the DKK seeks to continually support and enhance knowledge on 
these potentially high-impact druggable targets.

RIOK2 is an understudied kinase associated with a variety of human cancers 
including non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. No potent, selective, and 
cell-active chemical probe currently exists for RIOK2. Such a reagent would 
expedite re-search into the biological functions of RIOK2 and validate it as a 
therapeutic target. Herein, we describe the synthesis of naphthyl-pyridine based 
compounds that have improved cellular activity while maintaining selectivity for 
RIOK2. While our compounds do not represent RIOK2 chemical probes, they are the 
best available tool molecules to begin to characterize RIOK2 function in vitro.

With an estimated prevalence of 463 million affected, type 2 diabetes represents 
a major challenge to health care systems worldwide. Analyzing the plasma 
proteomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes may illuminate hitherto unknown 
functional mechanisms underlying disease pathology. We assessed the associations 
between type 2 diabetes and >1,000 plasma proteins in the Cooperative Health 
Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) F4 cohort (n = 993, 110 cases), with 
subsequent replication in the third wave of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study 
(HUNT3) cohort (n = 940, 149 cases). We computed logistic regression models 
adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and hypertension. Additionally, we 
investigated associations with incident type 2 diabetes and performed two-sample 
bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to prioritize our results. 
Association analysis of prevalent type 2 diabetes revealed 24 replicated 
proteins, of which 8 are novel. Proteins showing association with incident type 
2 diabetes were aminoacylase-1, growth hormone receptor, and insulin-like growth 
factor-binding protein 2. Aminoacylase-1 was associated with both prevalent and 
incident type 2 diabetes. MR analysis yielded nominally significant causal 
effects of type 2 diabetes on cathepsin Z and rennin, both known to have roles 
in the pathophysiological pathways of cardiovascular disease, and of sex 
hormone-binding globulin on type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, our high-throughput 
proteomics study replicated previously reported type 2 diabetes-protein 
associations and identified new candidate proteins possibly involved in the 
pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

The drug discovery process starts with identification of a disease-modifying 
target. This critical step traditionally begins with manual investigation of 
scientific literature and biomedical databases to gather evidence linking 
molecular target to disease, and to evaluate the efficacy, safety and commercial 
potential of the target. The high-throughput and affordability of current omics 
technologies, allowing quantitative measurements of many putative targets (e.g. 
DNA, RNA, protein, metabolite), has exponentially increased the volume of 
scientific data available for this arduous task. Therefore, computational 
platforms identifying and ranking disease-relevant targets from existing 
biomedical data sources, including omics databases, are needed. To date, more 
than 30 drug target discovery (DTD) platforms exist. They provide 
information-rich databases and graphical user interfaces to help scientists 
identify putative targets and pre-evaluate their therapeutic efficacy and 
potential side effects. Here we survey and compare a set of popular DTD 
platforms that utilize multiple data sources and omics-driven knowledge bases 
(either directly or indirectly) for identifying drug targets. We also provide a 
description of omics technologies and related data repositories which are 
important for DTD tasks.

Human genetic studies have implicated more than a hundred genes in Autism 
Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Understanding how variation in implicated genes 
influence expression of co-occurring conditions and drug response can inform 
more effective, personalized approaches for treatment of individuals with ASD. 
Rapidly translating this information into the clinic requires efficient 
algorithms to sort through the myriad of genes implicated by rare gene-damaging 
single nucleotide and copy number variants, and common variation detected in 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To pinpoint genes that are more likely 
to have clinically relevant variants, we developed a functional annotation 
pipeline. We defined clinical relevance in this project as any ASD associated 
gene with evidence indicating a patient may have a complex, co-occurring 
condition that requires direct intervention (e.g., sleep and gastrointestinal 
disturbances, attention deficit hyperactivity, anxiety, seizures, depression), 
or is relevant to drug development and/or approaches to maximizing efficacy and 
minimizing adverse events (i.e., pharmacogenomics). Starting with a list of all 
candidate genes implicated in all manifestations of ASD (i.e., idiopathic and 
syndromic), this pipeline uses databases that represent multiple lines of 
evidence to identify genes: (1) expressed in the human brain, (2) involved in 
ASD-relevant biological processes and resulting in analogous phenotypes in mice, 
(3) whose products are targeted by approved pharmaceutical compounds or 
possessing pharmacogenetic variation and (4) whose products directly interact 
with those of genes with variants recommended to be tested for by the American 
College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). Compared with 1000 gene sets, each with a 
random selection of human protein coding genes, more genes in the ASD set were 
annotated for each category evaluated (p ≤ 1.99 × 10-2). Of the 956 
ASD-implicated genes in the full set, 18 were flagged based on evidence in all 
categories. Fewer genes from randomly drawn sets were annotated in all 
categories (x = 8.02, sd = 2.56, p = 7.75 × 10-4). Notably, none of the 
prioritized genes are represented among the 59 genes compiled by the ACMG, and 
78% had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in ClinVar. Results from this 
work should rapidly prioritize potentially actionable results from genetic 
studies and, in turn, inform future work toward clinical decision support for 
personalized care based on genetic testing.

Drug Discovery is a lengthy and costly process and has faced a period of 
declining productivity within the last two decades resulting in increasing 
importance of integrative data-driven approaches. In this paper, data mining and 
integration is leveraged to inspect target innovation trends in drug discovery. 
The study highlights protein families and classes that have received more 
attention and those that have just emerged in the scientific literature, thus 
highlighting novel opportunities for drug intervention. In order to delineate 
the evolution of target-driven research interest from a biological perspective, 
trends in biological process annotations from Gene Ontology and disease 
annotations from DisGeNET are captured. The analysis reveals an increasing 
interest in targets related to immune system processes, and a recurrent trend 
for targets involved in circulatory system processes. At the level of diseases, 
targets associated with cancer-related pathologies, intellectual disability, and 
schizophrenia are increasingly investigated in recent years. The methodology 
enables researchers to capture trends in research attention in target space at 
an early stage during the drug discovery process. Workflows, scripts, and data 
used in this study are publicly available from 
https://github.com/BZdrazil/Moving_Targets . An interactive web application 
allows the customized exploration of target, biological process, and disease 
trends (available at https://rguha.shinyapps.io/MovingTargets/ ).

BACKGROUND: Protein kinases are a large family of druggable proteins that are 
genomically and proteomically altered in many human cancers. Kinase-targeted 
drugs are emerging as promising avenues for personalized medicine because of the 
differential response shown by altered kinases to drug treatment in patients and 
cell-based assays. However, an incomplete understanding of the relationships 
connecting genome, proteome and drug sensitivity profiles present a major 
bottleneck in targeting kinases for personalized medicine.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose a multi-component Quantitative 
Structure-Mutation-Activity Relationship Tests (QSMART) model and neural 
networks framework for providing explainable models of protein kinase inhibition 
and drug response ([Formula: see text]) profiles in cell lines. Using non-small 
cell lung cancer as a case study, we show that interaction terms that capture 
associations between drugs, pathways, and mutant kinases quantitatively 
contribute to the response of two EGFR inhibitors (afatinib and lapatinib). In 
particular, protein-protein interactions associated with the JNK apoptotic 
pathway, associations between lung development and axon extension, and 
interaction terms connecting drug substructures and the volume/charge of mutant 
residues at specific structural locations contribute significantly to the 
observed [Formula: see text] values in cell-based assays.
CONCLUSIONS: By integrating multi-omics data in the QSMART model, we not only 
predict drug responses in cancer cell lines with high accuracy but also identify 
features and explainable interaction terms contributing to the accuracy. 
Although we have tested our multi-component explainable framework on protein 
kinase inhibitors, it can be extended across the proteome to investigate the 
complex relationships connecting genotypes and drug sensitivity profiles.

MOTIVATION: In the event of an outbreak due to an emerging pathogen, time is of 
the essence to contain or to mitigate the spread of the disease. Drug 
repositioning is one of the strategies that has the potential to deliver 
therapeutics relatively quickly. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that 
integrating critical data resources to drive drug-repositioning studies, 
involving host-host, hostpathogen and drug-target interactions, remains a 
time-consuming effort that translates to a delay in the development and delivery 
of a life-saving therapy.
RESULTS: Here, we describe a workflow we designed for a semi-automated 
integration of rapidly emerging datasets that can be generally adopted in a 
broad network pharmacology research setting. The workflow was used to construct 
a COVID-19 focused multimodal network that integrates 487 host-pathogen, 74,805 
host-host protein and 1,265 drug-target interactions. The resultant Neo4j graph 
database named "Neo4COVID19" is accessible via a web interface and via API calls 
based on the Bolt protocol. We believe that our Neo4COVID19 database will be a 
valuable asset to the research community and will catalyze the discovery of 
therapeutics to fight COVID-19.

The approval of the first kinase inhibitor, Gleevec, ushered in a paradigm shift 
for oncological treatment-the use of genomic data for targeted, efficacious 
therapies. Since then, over 48 additional small-molecule kinase inhibitors have 
been approved, solidifying the case for kinases as a highly druggable and 
attractive target class. Despite the role deregulated kinase activity plays in 
cancer, only 8% of the kinome has been effectively "drugged." Moreover, 24% of 
the 634 human kinases are understudied. We have developed a comprehensive 
scoring system that utilizes differential gene expression, pathological 
parameters, overall survival, and mutational hotspot analysis to rank and 
prioritize clinically relevant kinases across 17 solid tumor cancers from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas. We have developed the clinical kinase index (CKI) app 
(http://cki.ccs.miami.edu) to facilitate interactive analysis of all kinases in 
each cancer. Collectively, we report that understudied kinases have potential 
clinical value as biomarkers or drug targets that warrant further study.

The Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) is a publicly-available chemogenomic 
library distributed to more than 300 laboratories by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) 
between 2011 and 2015 and by SGC-UNC from 2015 to 2017. Screening this library 
of well-annotated, published kinase inhibitors has yielded a plethora of data in 
diverse therapeutic and scientific areas, funded applications, publications, and 
provided impactful pre-clinical results. GW296115 is a compound that was 
included in PKIS based on its promising selectivity following profiling against 
260 human kinases. Herein we present more comprehensive profiling data for 403 
wild type human kinases and follow-up enzymatic screening results for GW296115. 
This more thorough investigation of GW296115 has confirmed it as a potent 
inhibitor of kinases including BRSK1 and BRSK2 that were identified in the 
original panel of 260 kinases as well as surfaced other kinases that it potently 
inhibits. Based on these new kinome-wide screening results, we report that 
GW296115 is an inhibitor of several members of the Illuminating the Druggable 
Genome (IDG) list of understudied dark kinases. Specifically, our results 
establish GW296115 as a potent lead chemical tool that inhibits six IDG kinases 
with IC50 values less than 100 nM. Focused studies establish that GW296115 is 
cell active, and directly engages BRSK2. Further evaluation showed that GW296115 
downregulates BRSK2-driven phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Therefore, 
we present GW296115 as a cell-active chemical tool that can be used to 
interrogate the poorly characterized function(s) of BRSK2.

Multiomics dissection of molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying 
autoimmune-associated noncoding SNPs.

Zhang L, Guo Y, Yang TL.

More than 90% of autoimmune-associated variants are located in noncoding 
regions, leading to challenges in deciphering the underlying causal roles of 
functional variants and genes and biological mechanisms. Therefore, to reduce 
the gap between traditional genetic findings and mechanistic understanding of 
disease etiologies and clinical drug development, it is important to translate 
systematically the regulatory mechanisms underlying noncoding variants. Here, we 
prioritized functional noncoding SNPs with regulatory gene targets associated 
with 19 autoimmune diseases by incorporating hundreds of immune cell-specific 
multiomics data. The prioritized SNPs are associated with transcription factor 
(TF) binding, histone modification, or chromatin accessibility, indicating their 
allele-specific regulatory roles. Their target genes are significantly enriched 
in immunologically related pathways and other known immunologically related 
functions. We found that 90.1% of target genes are regulated by distal SNPs 
involving several TFs (e.g., the DNA-binding protein CCCTC-binding factor 
[CTCF]), suggesting the importance of long-range chromatin interaction in 
autoimmune diseases. Moreover, we predicted potential drug targets for 
autoimmune diseases, including 2 genes (NFKB1 and SH2B3) with known drug 
indications on other diseases, highlighting their potential drug repurposing 
opportunities. Taken together, these findings may provide useful information for 
future experimental follow-up and drug applications on autoimmune diseases.

When trying to identify new potential therapeutic protein targets, access to 
data and knowledge is increasingly important. In a field where new resources and 
data sources become available every day, it is crucial to be able to take a step 
back and look at the wider picture in order to identify potential drug targets. 
While this task is routinely performed by bespoke literature searches, it is 
often time-consuming and lacks uniformity when comparing multiple targets at one 
time. To address this challenge, we developed TargetDB, a tool that aggregates 
public information available on given target(s) (links to disease, safety, 3D 
structures, ligandability, novelty, etc.) and assembles it in an easy to read 
output ready for the researcher to analyze. In addition, we developed a target 
scoring system based on the desirable attributes of good therapeutic targets and

Breast cancer affects women globally; the majority of breast cancer-related 
mortalities are due to metastasis. Acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype has 
been implicated in the progression of breast cancer cells to an invasive, 
metastatic state. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes have high rates 
of metastases, recurrence, and have poorer prognoses compared to other breast 
cancer types, partially due to lack of commonly targeted receptors. Kinases have 
diverse and pivotal functions in metastasis in TNBC, and discovery of new kinase 
targets for TNBC is warranted. We previously used a screening approach to 
identify intermediate-synthesis nonpotent, nonselective small-molecule 
inhibitors from the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set that reversed the mesenchymal 
phenotype in TNBC cells. Two of these inhibitors (GSK346294A and GSK448459A) are 
structurally similar, but have unique kinase activity profiles and exhibited 
differential biologic effects on TNBC cells, specifically on 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we further interrogate these 
effects and compare activity of these inhibitors on transwell migration, gene 
(qRT-PCR) and protein (western blot) expressions, and cancer stem cell-like 
behavior. We incorporated translational patient-derived xenograft models in 
these studies, and we focused on the lead inhibitor hit, GSK346294A, to 
demonstrate the utility of our comparative analysis as a screening modality to 
identify novel kinase targets and signaling pathways to pursue in TNBC. This 
study introduces a new method for discovering novel kinase targets that reverse 
the EMT phenotype; this screening approach can be applied to all cancer types 
and is not limited to breast cancer.

Small molecules are usually compared by their chemical structure, but there is 
no unified analytic framework for representing and comparing their biological 
activity. We present the Chemical Checker (CC), which provides processed, 
harmonized and integrated bioactivity data on ~800,000 small molecules. The CC 
divides data into five levels of increasing complexity, from the chemical 
properties of compounds to their clinical outcomes. In between, it includes 
targets, off-targets, networks and cell-level information, such as omics data, 
growth inhibition and morphology. Bioactivity data are expressed in a vector 
format, extending the concept of chemical similarity to similarity between 
bioactivity signatures. We show how CC signatures can aid drug discovery tasks, 
including target identification and library characterization. We also 
demonstrate the discovery of compounds that reverse and mimic biological 
signatures of disease models and genetic perturbations in cases that could not 
be addressed using chemical information alone. Overall, the CC signatures 
facilitate the conversion of bioactivity data to a format that is readily 
amenable to machine learning methods.

BACKGROUND: The development of a safe, effective, reversible, non-hormonal 
contraceptive method for men has been an ongoing effort for the past few 
decades. However, despite significant progress on elucidating the function of 
key proteins involved in reproduction, understanding male reproductive 
physiology is limited by incomplete information on the genes expressed in 
reproductive tissues, and no contraceptive targets have so far reached clinical 
trials. To advance product development, further identification of novel 
reproductive tract-specific genes leading to potentially druggable protein 
targets is imperative.
RESULTS: In this study, we expand on previous single tissue, single species 
studies by integrating analysis of publicly available human and mouse RNA-seq 
datasets whose initial published purpose was not focused on identifying male 
reproductive tract-specific targets. We also incorporate analysis of additional 
newly acquired human and mouse testis and epididymis samples to increase the 
number of targets identified. We detected a combined total of 1178 genes for 
which no previous evidence of male reproductive tract-specific expression was 
annotated, many of which are potentially druggable targets. Through RT-PCR, we 
confirmed the reproductive tract-specific expression of 51 novel orthologous 
human and mouse genes without a reported mouse model. Of these, we ablated four 
epididymis-specific genes (Spint3, Spint4, Spint5, and Ces5a) and two 
testis-specific genes (Pp2d1 and Saxo1) in individual or double knockout mice 
generated through the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our results validate a functional 
requirement for Spint4/5 and Ces5a in male mouse fertility, while demonstrating 
that Spint3, Pp2d1, and Saxo1 are each individually dispensable for male mouse 
fertility.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides a plethora of novel testis- and 
epididymis-specific genes and elucidates the functional requirement of several 
of these genes, which is essential towards understanding the etiology of male 
infertility and the development of male contraceptives.

SUMMARY: Estimating efficacy of gene-target-disease associations is a 
fundamental step in drug discovery. An important data source for this laborious 
task is RNA expression, which can provide gene-disease associations on the basis 
of expression fold change and statistical significance. However, the simply use 
of the log-fold change can lead to numerous false-positive associations. On the 
other hand, more sophisticated methods that utilize gene co-expression networks 
do not consider tissue specificity. Here, we introduce Transcriptome-driven 
Efficacy estimates for gene-based TArget discovery (ThETA), an R package that 
enables non-expert users to use novel efficacy scoring methods for drug-target 
discovery. In particular, ThETA allows users to search for gene perturbation 
(therapeutics) that reverse disease-gene expression and genes that are closely 
related to disease-genes in tissue-specific networks. ThETA also provides 
functions to integrate efficacy evaluations obtained with different approaches 
and to build an overall efficacy score, which can be used to identify and 
prioritize gene(target)-disease associations. Finally, ThETA implements 
visualizations to show tissue-specific interconnections between target and 
disease-genes, and to indicate biological annotations associated with the top 
selected genes.

Sepsis is a series of clinical syndromes caused by the immunological response to 
infection. The clinical evidence for sepsis could typically attribute to 
bacterial infection or bacterial endotoxins, but infections due to viruses, 
fungi or parasites could also lead to sepsis. Regardless of the etiology, rapid 
clinical deterioration, prolonged stay in intensive care units and high risk for 
mortality correlate with the incidence of sepsis. Despite its prevalence and 
morbidity, improvement in sepsis outcomes has remained limited. In this 
comprehensive review, we summarize the current landscape of risk estimation, 
diagnosis, treatment and prognosis strategies in the setting of sepsis and 
discuss future challenges. We argue that the advent of modern technologies such 
as in-depth molecular profiling, biomedical big data and machine intelligence 
methods will augment the treatment and prevention of sepsis. The volume, 
variety, veracity and velocity of heterogeneous data generated as part of 
healthcare delivery and recent advances in biotechnology-driven therapeutics and 
companion diagnostics may provide a new wave of approaches to identify the most 
at-risk sepsis patients and reduce the symptom burden in patients within shorter 
turnaround times. Developing novel therapies by leveraging modern drug discovery 
strategies including computational drug repositioning, cell and gene-therapy, 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -based genetic editing 
systems, immunotherapy, microbiome restoration, nanomaterial-based therapy and 
phage therapy may help to develop treatments to target sepsis. We also provide 
empirical evidence for potential new sepsis targets including FER and STARD3NL. 
Implementing data-driven methods that use real-time collection and analysis of 
clinical variables to trace, track and treat sepsis-related adverse outcomes 
will be key. Understanding the root and route of sepsis and its comorbid 
conditions that complicate treatment outcomes and lead to organ dysfunction may 
help to facilitate identification of most at-risk patients and prevent further 
deterioration. To conclude, leveraging the advances in precision medicine, 
biomedical data science and translational bioinformatics approaches may help to 
develop better strategies to diagnose and treat sepsis in the next decade.

Recurrent copy-number alterations, mutations, and transcript fusions of the 
genes encoding CDKs/cyclins are characterized in >10,000 tumors. Genomic 
alterations of CDKs/cyclins are dominantly driven by copy number aberrations. In 
contrast to cell-cycle-related CDKs/cyclins, which are globally amplified, 
transcriptional CDKs/cyclins recurrently lose copy numbers across cancers. 
Although mutations and transcript fusions are relatively rare events, CDK12 
exhibits recurrent mutations in multiple cancers. Among the transcriptional 
CDKs, CDK7 and CDK12 show the most significant copy number loss and mutation, 
respectively. Their genomic alterations are correlated with increased 
sensitivities to DNA-damaging drugs. Inhibition of CDK7 preferentially represses 
the expression of genes in the DNA-damage-repair pathways and impairs the 
activity of homologous recombination. Low-dose CDK7 inhibitor treatment 
sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitor-induced DNA damage and cell death. Our 
analysis provides genomic information for identification and prioritization of 
drug targets for CDKs and reveals rationales for treatment strategies.

Currently, the development of new effective drugs for cancer therapy is not only 
hindered by development costs, drug efficacy, and drug safety but also by the 
rapid occurrence of drug resistance in cancer. Hence, new tools are needed to 
study the underlying mechanisms in cancer. Here, we discuss the current use of 
metabolic modelling approaches to identify cancer-specific metabolism and find 
possible new drug targets and drugs for repurposing. Furthermore, we list 
valuable resources that are needed for the reconstruction of cancer-specific 
models by integrating various available datasets with genome-scale metabolic 
reconstructions using model-building algorithms. We also discuss how new drug 
targets can be determined by using gene essentiality analysis, an in silico 
method to predict essential genes in a given condition such as cancer and how 
synthetic lethality studies could greatly benefit cancer patients by suggesting 
drug combinations with reduced side effects.

Prediction of chemical bioactivity and physical properties has been one of the 
most important applications of statistical and more recently, machine learning 
and artificial intelligence methods in chemical sciences. This field of 
research, broadly known as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) 
modeling, has developed many important algorithms and has found a broad range of 
applications in physical organic and medicinal chemistry in the past 55+ years. 
This Perspective summarizes recent technological advances in QSAR modeling but 
it also highlights the applicability of algorithms, modeling methods, and 
validation practices developed in QSAR to a wide range of research areas outside 
of traditional QSAR boundaries including synthesis planning, nanotechnology, 
materials science, biomaterials, and clinical informatics. As modern research 
methods generate rapidly increasing amounts of data, the knowledge of robust 
data-driven modelling methods professed within the QSAR field can become 
essential for scientists working both within and outside of chemical research. 
We hope that this contribution highlighting the generalizable components of QSAR 
modeling will serve to address this challenge.

OBJECTIVES: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is a new technique used to 
interrogate the transcriptome of individual cells within native tissues that 
have already resulted in key discoveries in auditory basic science research. 
Rapid advances in scRNA-Seq make it likely that it will soon be translated into 
clinical medicine. The goal of this review is to inspire the use of scRNA-Seq in 
otolaryngology by giving examples of how it can be applied to patient samples 
and how this information can be used clinically.
METHODS: Studies were selected based on the scientific quality and relevance to 
scRNA-Seq. In addition to mouse auditory system (inner ear including hair cells 
and supporting cells, spiral ganglion neurons, and inner ear organoids), recent 
studies using human primary cell samples are discussed. We also perform our own 
analysis on publicly available, published scRNA-Seq data from oral head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples to serve as an example of a clinically 
relevant application of scRNA-Seq.
RESULTS: Studies focusing on patient tissues show that scRNA-Seq reveals tissue 
heterogeneity and rare-cell types responsible for disease pathogenesis. The 
heterogeneity detected by scRNA-Seq can result in both the identification of 
known or novel disease biomarkers and drug targets. Our analysis of HNSCC data 
gives an example for how otolaryngologists can use scRNA-Seq for clinical use.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there are limitations to the translation of scRNA-Seq to 
the clinic, we show that its use in otolaryngology can give physicians insight 
into the tissue heterogeneity within their patient's diseased tissue giving them 
information on disease pathogenesis, novel disease biomarkers or druggable 
targets, and aid in selecting patient-specific drug cocktails.

MOTIVATION: Micro-blogging with Twitter to communicate new results, discuss 
ideas and share techniques is becoming central. While most Twitter users are 
real people, the Twitter API provides the opportunity to develop Twitter bots 
and to analyze global trends in tweets.
RESULTS: EnrichrBot is a bot that tracks and tweets information about human 
genes implementing six principal functions: (i) tweeting information about

Pharos is an integrated web-based informatics platform for the analysis of data 
aggregated by the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Knowledge Management 
Center, an NIH Common Fund initiative. The current version of Pharos (as of 
October 2019) spans 20,244 proteins in the human proteome, 19,880 disease and 
phenotype associations, and 226,829 ChEMBL compounds. This resource not only 
collates and analyzes data from over 60 high-quality resources to generate these 
types, but also uses text indexing to find less apparent connections between 
targets, and has recently begun to collaborate with institutions that generate 
data and resources. Proteins are ranked according to a knowledge-based 
classification system, which can help researchers to identify less studied 
"dark" targets that could be potentially further illuminated. This is an 
important process for both drug discovery and target validation, as more 
knowledge can accelerate target identification, and previously understudied 
proteins can serve as novel targets in drug discovery. Two basic protocols 
illustrate the levels of detail available for targets and several methods of 
finding targets of interest. An Alternate Protocol illustrates the difference in 
available knowledge between less and more studied targets. © 2020 by John Wiley

The discovery of novel ligands for orphan GPCRs has profoundly affected our 
understanding of human biology, opening new opportunities for research, and 
ultimately for therapeutic development. Accordingly, much effort has been 
directed towards the remaining orphan receptors, yet the rate of GPCR 
de-orphanisation has slowed in recent years. Here, we briefly review 
contemporary methodologies of de-orphanisation and then highlight our recent 
integrated computational and experimental approach for discovery of novel 
peptide ligands for orphan GPCRs. We identified putative endogenous peptide 
ligands and found peptide receptor sequence and structural characteristics 
present in selected orphan receptors. With comprehensive pharmacological 
screening using three complementary assays, we discovered novel pairings of 17 
peptides with five different orphan GPCRs and revealed potential additional 
ligands for nine peptide GPCRs. These promising findings lay the foundation for 
future studies on these peptides and receptors to characterise their roles in 
human physiology and disease.

Most rare diseases still lack approved treatments despite major advances in 
research providing the tools to understand their molecular basis, as well as 
legislation providing regulatory and economic incentives to catalyse the 
development of specific therapies. Addressing this translational gap is a 
multifaceted challenge, for which a key aspect is the selection of the optimal 
therapeutic modality for translating advances in rare disease knowledge into 
potential medicines, known as orphan drugs. With this in mind, we discuss here 
the technological basis and rare disease applicability of the main therapeutic 
modalities, including small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, protein 
replacement therapies, oligonucleotides and gene and cell therapies, as well as 
drug repurposing. For each modality, we consider its strengths and limitations 
as a platform for rare disease therapy development and describe clinical 
progress so far in developing drugs based on it. We also discuss selected 
overarching topics in the development of therapies for rare diseases, such as 
approval statistics, engagement of patients in the process, regulatory pathways 
and digital tools.

MOTIVATION: Drug discovery investigations need to incorporate network 
pharmacology concepts while navigating the complex landscape of drug-target and 
target-target interactions. This task requires solutions that integrate 
high-quality biomedical data, combined with analytic and predictive workflows as 
well as efficient visualization. SmartGraph is an innovative platform that 
utilizes state-of-the-art technologies such as a Neo4j graph-database, Angular 
web framework, RxJS asynchronous event library and D3 visualization to 
accomplish these goals.
RESULTS: The SmartGraph framework integrates high quality bioactivity data and 
biological pathway information resulting in a knowledgebase comprised of 420,526 
unique compound-target interactions defined between 271,098 unique compounds and 
2018 targets. SmartGraph then performs bioactivity predictions based on the 
63,783 Bemis-Murcko scaffolds extracted from these compounds. Through several 
use-cases, we illustrate the use of SmartGraph to generate hypotheses for 
elucidating mechanism-of-action, drug-repurposing and off-target prediction.

Pathway Commons (https://www.pathwaycommons.org) is an integrated resource of 
publicly available information about biological pathways including biochemical 
reactions, assembly of biomolecular complexes, transport and catalysis events 
and physical interactions involving proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules 
(e.g. metabolites and drug compounds). Data is collected from multiple providers 
in standard formats, including the Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX) language 
and the Proteomics Standards Initiative Molecular Interactions format, and then 
integrated. Pathway Commons provides biologists with (i) tools to search this 
comprehensive resource, (ii) a download site offering integrated bulk sets of 
pathway data (e.g. tables of interactions and gene sets), (iii) reusable 
software libraries for working with pathway information in several programming 
languages (Java, R, Python and Javascript) and (iv) a web service for 
programmatically querying the entire dataset. Visualization of pathways is 
supported using the Systems Biological Graphical Notation (SBGN). Pathway 
Commons currently contains data from 22 databases with 4794 detailed human 
biochemical processes (i.e. pathways) and ∼2.3 million interactions. To enhance 
the usability of this large resource for end-users, we develop and maintain 
interactive web applications and training materials that enable pathway 
exploration and advanced analysis.

The stria vascularis (SV) generates the endocochlear potential (EP) in the inner 
ear and is necessary for proper hair cell mechanotransduction and hearing. While 
channels belonging to SV cell types are known to play crucial roles in EP 
generation, relatively little is known about gene regulatory networks that 
underlie the ability of the SV to generate and maintain the EP. Using single 
cell and single nucleus RNA-sequencing, we identify and validate known and rare 
cell populations in the SV. Furthermore, we establish a basis for understanding 
molecular mechanisms underlying SV function by identifying potential gene 
regulatory networks as well as druggable gene targets. Finally, we associate 
known deafness genes with adult SV cell types. This work establishes a basis for 
dissecting the genetic mechanisms underlying the role of the SV in hearing and 
will serve as a basis for designing therapeutic approaches to hearing loss 
related to SV dysfunction.

The increase in the number of both patients and healthcare practitioners who 
grew up using the Internet and computers (so-called "digital natives") is likely 
to impact the practice of precision medicine, and requires novel platforms for 
data integration and mining, as well as contextualized information retrieval. 
The "Illuminating the Druggable Genome Knowledge Management Center" (IDG KMC) 
quantifies data availability from a wide range of chemical, biological, and 
clinical resources, and has developed platforms that can be used to navigate 
understudied proteins (the "dark genome"), and their potential contribution to 
specific pathologies. Using the "Target Importance and Novelty Explorer" (TIN-X) 
highlights the role of LRRC10 (a dark gene) in dilated cardiomyopathy. Combining 
mouse and human phenotype data leads to increased strength of evidence, which is 
discussed for four additional dark genes: SLX4IP and its role in glucose 
metabolism, the role of HSF2BP in coronary artery disease, the involvement of 
ELFN1 in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and the role of VPS13D in 
mouse neural tube development and its confirmed role in childhood onset movement 
disorders. The workflow and tools described here are aimed at guiding further 
experimental research, particularly within the context of precision medicine.

Biological target (commonly genes or proteins) identification is still largely a 
manual process, where experts manually try to collect and combine information 
from hundreds of data sources, ranging from scientific publications to omics 
databases. Targeting the wrong gene or protein will lead to failure of the drug 
development process, as well as incur delays and costs. To improve this process, 
different software platforms are being developed. These platforms rely strongly 
on efficacy estimates based on target-disease association scores created by 
computational methods for drug target prioritization. Here novel computational 
methods are presented to more accurately evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
potential drug targets. The proposed efficacy scores utilize existing gene 
expression data and tissue/disease specific networks to improve the inference of 
target-disease associations. Conversely, safety scores enable the identification 
of genes that are essential, potentially susceptible to adverse effects or 
carcinogenic. Benchmark results demonstrate that our transcriptome-based methods 
for drug target prioritization can increase the true positive rate of 
target-disease associations. Additionally, the proposed safety evaluation system 
enables accurate predictions of targets of withdrawn drugs and targets of drug 
trials prematurely discontinued.

The frequency by which genes are studied correlates with the prior knowledge 
accumulated about them. This leads to an imbalance in research attention where 
some genes are highly investigated while others are ignored. Geneshot is a 
search engine developed to illuminate this gap and to promote attention to the 
under-studied genome. Through a simple web interface, Geneshot enables 
researchers to enter arbitrary search terms, to receive ranked lists of genes 
relevant to the search terms. Returned ranked gene lists contain genes that were 
previously published in association with the search terms, as well as genes 
predicted to be associated with the terms based on data integration from 
multiple sources. The search results are presented with interactive 
visualizations. To predict gene function, Geneshot utilizes gene-gene similarity 
matrices from processed RNA-seq data, or from gene-gene co-occurrence data 
obtained from multiple sources. In addition, Geneshot can be used to analyze the 
novelty of gene sets and augment gene sets with additional relevant genes. The 
Geneshot web-server and API are freely and openly available from 
https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/geneshot.

A plethora of databases exist online that can assist in in silico chemical or 
drug safety assessment. However, a systematic review and grouping of databases, 
based on purpose and information content, consolidated in a single source, has 
been lacking. To resolve this issue, this review provides a comprehensive 
listing of the key in silico data resources relevant to: chemical identity and 
properties, drug action, toxicology (including nano-material toxicity), 
exposure, omics, pathways, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Elimination 
(ADME) properties, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, patents-related 
databases, biological (genes, enzymes, proteins, other macromolecules etc.) 
databases, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), environmental exposure related, 
and finally databases relating to animal alternatives in support of 3Rs 
policies. More than nine hundred databases were identified and reviewed against 
criteria relating to accessibility, data coverage, interoperability or 
application programming interface (API), appropriate identifiers, types of in 
vitro, in vivo,-clinical or other data recorded and suitability for modelling, 
read-across, or similarity searching. This review also specifically addresses 
the need for solutions for mapping and integration of databases into a common 
platform for better translatability of preclinical data to clinical data.

MOTIVATION: The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) nuclease system has allowed for 
high-throughput, large scale pooled screens for functional genomic studies. To 
aid in the translation of functional genomics to therapeutics, we developed 
DrugThatGene (DTG) as a web-based application that streamlines analysis of 
potential therapeutic targets identified from functional genetic screens.
RESULTS: Starting from a gene list as input, DTG offers automated identification 
of small molecules along with supporting information from human genetic and 
other relevant databases. Furthermore, DTG aids in the identification of common 
biological pathways and protein complexes in conjunction with associated small 
molecule inhibitors. Taken together, DTG aims to expedite the identification of 
small molecules from the abundance of functional genetic data generated from 
CRISPR screens.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DTG is an open-source and free software 
available as a website at http://drugthatgene.pinellolab.org. Source code is 
available at: https://github.com/pinellolab/DrugThatGene, which can be 
downloaded in order to run DTG locally.

Tissue-specific genes are believed to be good drug targets due to improved 
safety. Here we show that this intuitive notion is not reflected in phase 1 and 
2 clinical trials, despite the historic success of tissue-specific targets and 
their 2.3-fold overrepresentation among targets of marketed non-oncology drugs. 
We compare properties of tissue-specific genes and drug targets. We show that 
tissue-specificity of the target may also be related to efficacy of the drug. 
The relationship may be indirect (enrichment in Mendelian disease and PTVesc 
genes) or direct (elevated betweenness centrality scores for tissue-specifically 
produced enzymes and secreted proteins). Reduced evolutionary conservation of 
tissue-specific genes may represent a bottleneck for drug projects, prompting 
development of novel models with smaller evolutionary gap to humans. We show 
that the opportunities to identify tissue-specific drug targets are not 
exhausted and discuss potential use cases for tissue-specific genes in drug 
research.

In response to a need for improved treatments, a number of promising novel 
targeted cancer therapies are being developed that exploit human synthetic 
lethal interactions. This is facilitating personalised medicine strategies in 
cancers where specific tumour suppressors have become inactivated. Mainly due to 
the constraints of the experimental procedures, relatively few human synthetic 
lethal interactions have been identified. Here we describe SLant (Synthetic 
Lethal analysis via Network topology), a computational systems approach to 
predicting human synthetic lethal interactions that works by identifying and 
exploiting conserved patterns in protein interaction network topology both 
within and across species. SLant out-performs previous attempts to classify 
human SSL interactions and experimental validation of the models predictions 
suggests it may provide useful guidance for future SSL screenings and ultimately 
aid targeted cancer therapy development.

Several public databases have emerged over the past decade to enable chemo- and 
bio-informatics research in the field of drug development. To a naive observer, 
as well as many seasoned professionals, the differences among many drug 
databases are unclear. We assessed the availability of all pharmaceuticals with 
evidence of clinical testing (i.e., been in at least a Phase I clinical trial) 
and highlight the major differences and similarities between public databases 
containing clinically tested pharmaceuticals. We review a selection of the most 
recent and prominent databases including: ChEMBL, CRIB NME, DrugBank, 
DrugCentral, PubChem, repoDB, SuperDrug2 and WITHDRAWN, and found that ∼11700 
unique active pharmaceutical ingredients are available in the public domain, 
with evidence of clinical testing.

The major depressive disorder (MDD) working group of the Psychiatric Genomics 
Consortium (PGC) has published a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for MDD in 
130,664 cases, identifying 44 risk variants. We used these results to 
investigate potential drug targets and repurposing opportunities. We built 
easily interpretable bipartite drug-target networks integrating interactions 
between drugs and their targets, genome-wide association statistics, and 
genetically predicted expression levels in different tissues, using the online 
tool Drug Targetor ( drugtargetor.com ). We also investigated drug-target 
relationships that could be impacting MDD. MAGMA was used to perform pathway 
analyses and S-PrediXcan to investigate the directionality of tissue-specific 
expression levels in patients vs. controls. Outside the major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) region, 153 protein-coding genes are significantly associated with 
MDD in MAGMA after multiple testing correction; among these, five are predicted 
to be down or upregulated in brain regions and 24 are known druggable genes. 
Several drug classes were significantly enriched, including monoamine reuptake 
inhibitors, sex hormones, antipsychotics, and antihistamines, indicating an 
effect on MDD and potential repurposing opportunities. These findings not only 
require validation in model systems and clinical examination, but also show that 
GWAS may become a rich source of new therapeutic hypotheses for MDD and other 
psychiatric disorders that need new-and better-treatment options.

Protein networks have become a popular tool for analyzing and visualizing the 
often long lists of proteins or genes obtained from proteomics and other 
high-throughput technologies. One of the most popular sources of such networks 
is the STRING database, which provides protein networks for more than 2000 
organisms, including both physical interactions from experimental data and 
functional associations from curated pathways, automatic text mining, and 
prediction methods. However, its web interface is mainly intended for inspection 
of small networks and their underlying evidence. The Cytoscape software, on the 
other hand, is much better suited for working with large networks and offers 
greater flexibility in terms of network analysis, import, and visualization of 
additional data. To include both resources in the same workflow, we created 
stringApp, a Cytoscape app that makes it easy to import STRING networks into 
Cytoscape, retains the appearance and many of the features of STRING, and 
integrates data from associated databases. Here, we introduce many of the 
stringApp features and show how they can be used to carry out complex network 
analysis and visualization tasks on a typical proteomics data set, all through 
the Cytoscape user interface. stringApp is freely available from the Cytoscape 
app store: http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp .

Despite recent clinical successes for irreversible drugs, potential toxicities 
mediated by unpredictable modification of off-target cysteines represents a 
major hurdle for expansion of covalent drug programs. Understanding the 
proteome-wide binding profile of covalent inhibitors can significantly 
accelerate their development; however, current mass spectrometry strategies 
typically do not provide a direct, amino acid level readout of covalent activity 
for complex, selective inhibitors. Here we report the development of CITe-Id, a 
novel chemoproteomic approach that employs covalent pharmacologic inhibitors as 
enrichment reagents in combination with an optimized proteomic platform to 
directly quantify dose-dependent binding at cysteine-thiols across the proteome. 
CITe-Id analysis of our irreversible CDK inhibitor THZ1 identified 
dose-dependent covalent modification of several unexpected kinases, including a 
previously unannotated cysteine (C840) on the understudied kinase PKN3. These 
data streamlined our development of JZ128 as a new selective covalent inhibitor 
of PKN3. Using JZ128 as a probe compound, we identified novel potential PKN3 
substrates, thus offering an initial molecular view of PKN3 cellular activity. 
CITe-Id provides a powerful complement to current chemoproteomic platforms to 
characterize the selectivity of covalent inhibitors, identify new, 
pharmacologically addressable cysteine-thiols, and inform structure-based drug 
design programs.

The Open Targets Platform integrates evidence from genetics, genomics, 
transcriptomics, drugs, animal models and scientific literature to score and 
rank target-disease associations for drug target identification. The 
associations are displayed in an intuitive user interface 
(https://www.targetvalidation.org), and are available through a REST-API 
(https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/docs/swagger-ui) and a bulk download 
(https://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data). In addition to target-disease 
associations, we also aggregate and display data at the target and disease 
levels to aid target prioritisation. Since our first publication two years ago, 
we have made eight releases, added new data sources for target-disease 
associations, started including causal genetic variants from non genome-wide 
targeted arrays, added new target and disease annotations, launched new 
visualisations and improved existing ones and released a new web tool for batch 
search of up to 200 targets. We have a new URL for the Open Targets Platform 
REST-API, new REST endpoints and also removed the need for authorisation for API 
fair use. Here, we present the latest developments of the Open Targets Platform, 
expanding the evidence and target-disease associations with new and improved 
data sources, refining data quality, enhancing website usability, and increasing 
our user base with our training workshops, user support, social media and 
bioinformatics forum engagement.

The pharmacological activity of Acacia nilotica's phytochemical constituents was 
confirmed with evidence-based studies, but the determination of exact targets 
that they bind and the mechanism of action were not done; consequently, we aim 
to identify the exact targets that are responsible for the pharmacological 
activity via the computational methods. Furthermore, we aim to predict the 
pharmacokinetics (ADME) properties and the safety profile in order to identify 
the best drug candidates. To achieve those goals, various computational methods 
were used including the ligand-based virtual screening and molecular docking. 
Moreover, pkCSM and SwissADME web servers were used for the prediction of 
pharmacokinetics and safety. The total number of the investigated compounds and 
targets was 25 and 61, respectively. According to the results, the 
pharmacological activity was attributed to the interaction with essential 
targets. Ellagic acid, Kaempferol, and Quercetin were the best A. nilotica's 
phytochemical constituents that contribute to the therapeutic activities, were 
non-toxic as well as non-carcinogen. The administration of Ellagic acid, 
Kaempferol, and Quercetin as combined drug via the novel drug delivery systems 
will be a valuable therapeutic choice for the treatment of recent diseases 
attacking the public health including cancer, multidrug-resistant bacterial 
infections, diabetes mellitus, and chronic inflammatory systemic disease.

Context-enriched interactome powered by proteomics helps the identification of 
novel regulators of macrophage activation.

The role of pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) is a complex one amenable to network approaches. While an indispensible 
tool for elucidating the molecular underpinnings of complex diseases including 
CVD, the interactome is limited in its utility as it is not specific to any cell 
type, experimental condition or disease state. We introduced context-specificity 
to the interactome by combining it with co-abundance networks derived from 
unbiased proteomics measurements from activated macrophage-like cells. Each 
macrophage phenotype contributed to certain regions of the interactome. Using a 
network proximity-based prioritization method on the combined network, we 
predicted potential regulators of macrophage activation. Prediction performance 
significantly increased with the addition of co-abundance edges, and the 
prioritized candidates captured inflammation, immunity and CVD signatures. 
Integrating the novel network topology with transcriptomics and proteomics 
revealed top candidate drivers of inflammation. In vitro loss-of-function 
experiments demonstrated the regulatory role of these proteins in 
pro-inflammatory signaling.

Plain Language Summary: When human cells or tissues are injured, the body 
triggers a response known as inflammation to repair the damage and protect 
itself from further harm. However, if the same issue keeps recurring, the 
tissues become inflamed for longer periods of time, which may ultimately lead to 
health problems. This is what could be happening in cardiovascular diseases, 
where long-term inflammation could damage the heart and blood vessels. Many 
different proteins interact with each other to control inflammation; gaining an 
insight into the nature of these interactions could help to pinpoint the role of 
each molecular actor. Researchers have used a combination of unbiased, 
large-scale experimental and computational approaches to develop the 
interactome, a map of the known interactions between all proteins in humans. 
However, interactions between proteins can change between cell types, or during 
disease. Here, Halu et al. aimed to refine the human interactome and identify 
new proteins involved in inflammation, especially in the context of 
cardiovascular disease. Cells called macrophages produce signals that trigger 
inflammation whey they detect damage in other cells or tissues. The experiments 
used a technique called proteomics to measure the amounts of all the proteins in 
human macrophages. Combining these data with the human interactome made it 
possible to predict new links between proteins known to have a role in 
inflammation and other proteins in the interactome. Further analysis using other 
sets of data from macrophages helped identify two new candidate proteins – GBP1 
and WARS – that may promote inflammation. Halu et al. then used a genetic 
approach to deactivate the genes and decrease the levels of these two proteins 
in macrophages, which caused the signals that encourage inflammation to drop. 
These findings suggest that GBP1 and WARS regulate the activity of macrophages 
to promote inflammation. The two proteins could therefore be used as drug 
targets to treat cardiovascular diseases and other disorders linked to 
inflammation, but further studies will be needed to precisely dissect how GBP1 
and WARS work in humans.

BACKGROUND: The Open Targets Platform integrates different data sources in order 
to facilitate identification of potential therapeutic drug targets to treat 
human diseases. It currently provides evidence for nearly 2.6 million potential 
target-disease pairs. G-protein coupled receptors are a drug target class of 
high interest because of the number of successful drugs being developed against 
them over many years. Here we describe a systematic approach utilizing the Open 
Targets Platform data to uncover and prioritize potential new disease 
indications for the G-protein coupled receptors and their ligands.
RESULTS: Utilizing the data available in the Open Targets platform, potential 
G-protein coupled receptor and endogenous ligand disease association pairs were 
systematically identified. Intriguing examples such as GPR35 for inflammatory 
bowel disease and CXCR4 for viral infection are used as illustrations of how a 
systematic approach can aid in the prioritization of interesting drug discovery 
hypotheses. Combining evidences for G-protein coupled receptors and their 
corresponding endogenous peptidergic ligands increases confidence and provides 
supportive evidence for potential new target-disease hypotheses. Comparing such 
hypotheses to the global pharma drug discovery pipeline to validate the approach 
showed that more than 93% of G-protein coupled receptor-disease pairs with a 
high overall Open Targets score involved receptors with an existing drug 
discovery program.
CONCLUSIONS: The Open Targets gene-disease score can be used to prioritize 
potential G-protein coupled receptors-indication hypotheses. In addition, 
availability of multiple different evidence types markedly increases confidence 
as does combining evidence from known receptor-ligand pairs. Comparing the 
top-ranked hypotheses to the current global pharma pipeline serves validation of 
our approach and identifies and prioritizes new therapeutic opportunities.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have varying and diverse physiological 
roles, transmitting signals from a range of stimuli, including light, chemicals, 
peptides, and mechanical forces. More than 130 GPCRs are orphan receptors (i.e., 
their endogenous ligands are unknown), representing a large untapped reservoir 
of potential therapeutic targets for pharmaceutical intervention in a variety of 
diseases. Current deorphanization approaches are slow, laborious, and usually 
require some in-depth knowledge about the receptor pharmacology. In this study 
we describe a cell-based assay to identify small molecule probes of orphan 
receptors that requires no a priori knowledge of receptor pharmacology. Built 
upon the concept of pharmacochaperones, where cell-permeable small molecules 
facilitate the trafficking of mutant receptors to the plasma membrane, the 
simple and robust technology is readily accessible by most laboratories and is 
amenable to high-throughput screening. The assay consists of a target harboring 
a synthetic point mutation that causes retention of the target in the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Coupled with a beta-galactosidase enzyme-fragment 
complementation reporter system, the assay identifies compounds that act as 
pharmacochaperones causing forward trafficking of the mutant GPCR. The assay can 
identify compounds with varying mechanisms of action including agonists and 
antagonists. A universal positive control compound circumvents the need for a 
target-specific ligand. The veracity of the approach is demonstrated using the 
beta-2-adrenergic receptor. Together with other existing assay technologies to 
validate the signaling pathways and the specificity of ligands identified, this 
pharmacochaperone-based approach can accelerate the identification of ligands 
for these potentially therapeutically useful receptors.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying drug therapeutic action and toxicity is 
crucial for the prevention and management of drug adverse reactions, and paves 
the way for a more efficient and rational drug design. The characterization of 
drug targets, drug metabolism proteins, and proteins associated to side effects 
according to their expression patterns, their tolerance to genomic variation and 
their role in cellular networks, is a necessary step in this direction. In this 
contribution, we hypothesize that different classes of proteins involved in the 
therapeutic effect of drugs and in their adverse effects have distinctive 
transcriptomics, genomics and network features. We explored the properties of 
these proteins within global and organ-specific interactomes, using multi-scale 
network features, evaluated their gene expression profiles in different organs 
and tissues, and assessed their tolerance to loss-of-function variants 
leveraging data from 60K subjects. We found that drug targets that mediate side 
effects are more central in cellular networks, more intolerant to 
loss-of-function variation, and show a wider breadth of tissue expression than 
targets not mediating side effects. In contrast, drug metabolizing enzymes and 
transporters are less central in the interactome, more tolerant to deleterious 
variants, and are more constrained in their tissue expression pattern. Our 
findings highlight distinctive features of proteins related to drug action, 
which could be applied to prioritize drugs with fewer probabilities of causing 
side effects.

BACKGROUND Osteosarcoma (OS) is a highly complicated bone cancer involving 
imbalance of signaling transduction networks in cells. Development of new 
anti-osteosarcoma drugs is very challenging, mainly due to lack of known key 
targets. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we attempted to reveal more 
promising targets for drug design by "Target-Pathway" network analysis, 
providing the new therapeutic strategy of osteosarcoma. The potential targets 
used for the treatment of OS were selected from 4 different sources: DrugBank, 
TCRD database, dbDEMC database, and recent scientific literature papers. 
Cytoscape was used for the establishment of the "Target-Pathway" network. 
RESULTS The obtained results suggest that tankyrase 2 (TNKS2) might be a very 
good potential protein target for the treatment of osteosarcoma. An in vitro MTT 
assay proved that it is an available option against OS by targeting the TNKS2 
protein. Subsequently, cell cycle and apoptosis assay by flow cytometry showed 
the TNKS2 inhibitor can obviously induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and 
mitotic cell death. CONCLUSIONS Tankyrase 2 (TNKS2), a member of the 
multifunctional poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), could be a very useful 
protein target for the treatment of osteosarcoma.

Choosing the right biological target is the critical primary decision for the 
development of new drugs. Systematic genetic association testing of both human 
diseases and quantitative traits, along with resultant findings of coincident 
associations between them, is becoming a powerful approach to infer drug 
targetable candidates and generate in vitro tests to identify compounds that can 
modulate them therapeutically. Here, we discuss opportunities and challenges, 
and infer criteria for the optimal use of genetic findings in the drug discovery 
pipeline.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain 
tumor, has a high mortality rate despite extensive efforts to develop new 
treatments. GBM exhibits both intra- and intertumor heterogeneity, lending to 
resistance and eventual tumor recurrence. Large-scale genomic and proteomic 
analysis of GBM tumors has uncovered potential drug targets. Effective and 
"druggable" targets must be validated to embark on a robust medicinal chemistry 
campaign culminating in the discovery of clinical candidates. Here, we review 
recent developments in GBM drug discovery and delivery. To identify GBM drug 
targets, we performed extensive bioinformatics analysis using data from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas project. We discovered 20 genes, BOC, CLEC4GP1, ELOVL6, 
EREG, ESR2, FDCSP, FURIN, FUT8-AS1, GZMB, IRX3, LITAF, NDEL1, NKX3-1, PODNL1, 
PTPRN, QSOX1, SEMA4F, TH, VEGFC, and C20orf166AS1 that are overexpressed in a 
subpopulation of GBM patients and correlate with poor survival outcomes. 
Importantly, nine of these genes exhibit higher expression in GBM versus 
low-grade glioma and may be involved in disease progression. In this review, we 
discuss these proteins in the context of GBM disease progression. We also 
conducted computational multi-parameter optimization to assess the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) permeability of small molecules in clinical trials for GBM 
treatment. Drug delivery in the context of GBM is particularly challenging 
because the BBB hinders small molecule transport. Therefore, we discuss novel 
drug delivery methods, including nanoparticles and prodrugs. Given the 
aggressive nature of GBM and the complexity of targeting the central nervous 
system, effective treatment options are a major unmet medical need. 
Identification and validation of biomarkers and drug targets associated with GBM 
disease progression present an exciting opportunity to improve treatment of this 
devastating disease.

Despite modern therapeutic advances, the survival prospects of pancreatic cancer 
patients have remained poor. Besides being highly metastatic, pancreatic cancer 
is challenging to treat because it is caused by a heterogeneous array of somatic 
mutations that impact a variety of signaling pathways and cellular regulatory 
systems. Here we use publicly available transcriptomic, copy number alteration 
and mutation profiling datasets from pancreatic cancer patients together with 
data on disease outcomes to show that the three major pancreatic cancer subtypes 
each display distinctive aberrations in cell signaling and metabolic pathways. 
Importantly, patients afflicted with these different pancreatic cancer subtypes 
also exhibit distinctive survival profiles. Within these patients, we find that 
dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein 
kinase pathways, and p53 mediated disruptions of cell cycle processes are 
apparently drivers of disease. Further, we identify for the first time the 
molecular perturbations of signalling networks that are likely the primary 
causes of oncogenesis in each of the three pancreatic cancer subtypes.

A large proportion of biomedical research and the development of therapeutics is 
focused on a small fraction of the human genome. In a strategic effort to map 
the knowledge gaps around proteins encoded by the human genome and to promote 
the exploration of currently understudied, but potentially druggable, proteins, 
the US National Institutes of Health launched the Illuminating the Druggable 
Genome (IDG) initiative in 2014. In this article, we discuss how the systematic 
collection and processing of a wide array of genomic, proteomic, chemical and 
disease-related resource data by the IDG Knowledge Management Center have 
enabled the development of evidence-based criteria for tracking the target 
development level (TDL) of human proteins, which indicates a substantial 
knowledge deficit for approximately one out of three proteins in the human 
proteome. We then present spotlights on the TDL categories as well as key drug 
target classes, including G protein-coupled receptors, protein kinases and ion 
channels, which illustrate the nature of the unexplored opportunities for 
biomedical research and therapeutic development.

Much biomedical research continues to focus on a small proportion of the human 
genome that has already been studied intensively. The Illuminating the Druggable 
Genome programme, initiated as a pilot project by the US National Institutes of 
Health Common Fund in 2014, is now being implemented to accelerate the 
investigation of subsets of understudied proteins that have potential 
therapeutic relevance.

Discovery of new pharmaceutical substances is currently boosted by the 
possibility of utilization of the Synthetically Accessible Virtual Inventory 
(SAVI) library, which includes about 283 million molecules, each annotated with 
a proposed synthetic one-step route from commercially available starting 
materials. The SAVI database is well-suited for ligand-based methods of virtual 
screening to select molecules for experimental testing. In this study, we 
compare the performance of three approaches for the analysis of 
structure-activity relationships that differ in their criteria for selecting of 
"active" and "inactive" compounds included in the training sets. PASS 
(Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances), which is based on a modified 
Naïve Bayes algorithm, was applied since it had been shown to be robust and to 
provide good predictions of many biological activities based on just the 
structural formula of a compound even if the information in the training set is 
incomplete. We used different subsets of kinase inhibitors for this case study 
because many data are currently available on this important class of drug-like 
molecules. Based on the subsets of kinase inhibitors extracted from the ChEMBL 
20 database we performed the PASS training, and then applied the model to ChEMBL 
23 compounds not yet present in ChEMBL 20 to identify novel kinase inhibitors. 
As one may expect, the best prediction accuracy was obtained if only the 
experimentally confirmed active and inactive compounds for distinct kinases in 
the training procedure were used. However, for some kinases, reasonable results 
were obtained even if we used merged training sets, in which we designated as 
inactives the compounds not tested against the particular kinase. Thus, 
depending on the availability of data for a particular biological activity, one 
may choose the first or the second approach for creating ligand-based 
computational tools to achieve the best possible results in virtual screening.

Many bioinformatics resources with unique perspectives on the protein landscape 
are currently available. However, generating new knowledge from these resources 
requires interoperable workflows that support cross-resource queries. In this 
study, we employ federated queries linking information from the Protein Kinase 
Ontology, iPTMnet, Protein Ontology, neXtProt, and the Mouse Genome Informatics 
to identify key knowledge gaps in the functional coverage of the human kinome 
and prioritize understudied kinases, cancer variants and post-translational 
modifications (PTMs) for functional studies. We identify 32 functional domains 
enriched in cancer variants and PTMs and generate mechanistic hypotheses on 
overlapping variant and PTM sites by aggregating information at the residue, 
protein, pathway and species level from these resources. We experimentally test 
the hypothesis that S768 phosphorylation in the C-helix of EGFR is inhibitory by 
showing that oncogenic variants altering S768 phosphorylation increase basal 
EGFR activity. In contrast, oncogenic variants altering conserved 
phosphorylation sites in the 'hydrophobic motif' of PKCβII (S660F and S660C) are 
loss-of-function in that they reduce kinase activity and enhance membrane 
translocation. Our studies provide a framework for integrative, consistent, and 
reproducible annotation of the cancer kinomes.

Multiplexed small molecule inhibitors covalently bound to Sepharose beads (MIBs) 
were used to capture functional kinases in luminal, HER2-enriched and triple 
negative (basal-like and claudin-low) breast cancer cell lines and tumors. 
Kinase MIB-binding profiles at baseline without perturbation proteomically 
distinguished the four breast cancer subtypes. Understudied kinases, whose 
disease associations and pharmacology are generally unexplored, were highly 
represented in MIB-binding taxonomies and are integrated into signaling 
subnetworks with kinases that have been previously well characterized in breast 
cancer. Computationally it was possible to define subtypes using profiles of 
less than 50 of the more than 300 kinases bound to MIBs that included 
understudied as well as metabolic and lipid kinases. Furthermore, analysis of 
MIB-binding profiles established potential functional annotations for these 
understudied kinases. Thus, comprehensive MIBs-based capture of kinases provides 
a unique proteomics-based method for integration of poorly characterized kinases 
of the understudied kinome into functional subnetworks in breast cancer cells 
and tumors that is not possible using genomic strategies. The MIB-binding 
profiles readily defined subtype-selective differential adaptive kinome 
reprogramming in response to targeted kinase inhibition, demonstrating how MIB 
profiles can be used in determining dynamic kinome changes that result in

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant primary adult brain tumor. 
The current standard of care is surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy 
treatment, which extends life in most cases. Unfortunately, tumor recurrence is 
nearly universal and patients with recurrent glioblastoma typically survive <1 
year. Therefore, new therapies and therapeutic combinations need to be developed 
that can be quickly approved for use in patients. However, in order to gain 
approval, therapies need to be safe as well as effective. One possible means of 
attaining rapid approval is repurposing FDA approved compounds for GBM therapy. 
However, candidate compounds must be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) and therefore a selection process has to be implemented to identify such 
compounds that can eliminate GBM tumor expansion. We review here psychiatric and 
non-psychiatric compounds that may be effective in GBM, as well as potential 
drugs targeting cell death pathways. We also discuss the potential of 
data-driven computational approaches to identify compounds that induce cell 
death in GBM cells, enabled by large reference databases such as the Library of 
Integrated Network Cell Signatures (LINCS). Finally, we argue that identifying 
pathways dysregulated in GBM in a patient specific manner is essential for 
effective repurposing in GBM and other gliomas.

ABSTRACT: Physiological and molecular similarities between organisms make it 
possible to translate findings from simpler experimental systems—model 
organisms—into more complex ones, such as human. This translation facilitates 
the understanding of biological processes under normal or disease conditions. 
Researchers aiming to identify the similarities and differences between 
organisms at the molecular level need resources collecting multi-organism tissue 
expression data. We have developed a database of gene–tissue associations in 
human, mouse, rat and pig by integrating multiple sources of evidence: 
transcriptomics covering all four species and proteomics (human only), manually 
curated and mined from the scientific literature. Through a scoring scheme, 
these associations are made comparable across all sources of evidence and across 
organisms. Furthermore, the scoring produces a confidence score assigned to each 
of the associations. The TISSUES database (version 2.0) is publicly accessible 
through a user-friendly web interface and as part of the STRING app for 
Cytoscape. In addition, we analyzed the agreement between datasets, across and 
within organisms, and identified that the agreement is mainly affected by the 
quality of the datasets rather than by the technologies used or organisms 
compared.

A core tenet of precision oncology is the rational choice of drugs to interact 
with patient-specific biological targets of interest, but it is currently 
difficult for researchers to obtain consistent and well-supported target 
information for pharmaceutical drugs. We review current drug-target interaction 
resources and critically assess how supporting evidence is handled. We introduce 
the concept of a unified Cancer Targetome to aggregate drug-target interactions 
in an evidence-based framework. We discuss current unmet needs and the 
implications for evidence-based clinical omics. The focus of this review is 
precision oncology but the discussion is highly relevant to targeted therapies 
in any area.

BACKGROUND: One of the most successful approaches to develop new small molecule 
therapeutics has been to start from a validated druggable protein target. 
However, only a small subset of potentially druggable targets has attracted 
significant research and development resources. The Illuminating the Druggable 
Genome (IDG) project develops resources to catalyze the development of likely 
targetable, yet currently understudied prospective drug targets. A central 
component of the IDG program is a comprehensive knowledge resource of the 
druggable genome.
RESULTS: As part of that effort, we have developed a framework to integrate, 
navigate, and analyze drug discovery data based on formalized and standardized 
classifications and annotations of druggable protein targets, the Drug Target 
Ontology (DTO). DTO was constructed by extensive curation and consolidation of 
various resources. DTO classifies the four major drug target protein families, 
GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on phylogenecity, 
function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression, 
chemical ligand and substrate characteristics, and target-family specific 
characteristics. The formal ontology was built using a new software tool to 
auto-generate most axioms from a database while supporting manual knowledge 
acquisition. A modular, hierarchical implementation facilitate ontology 
development and maintenance and makes use of various external ontologies, thus 
integrating the DTO into the ecosystem of biomedical ontologies. As a formal 
OWL-DL ontology, DTO contains asserted and inferred axioms. Modeling data from 
the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program 
illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced 
definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in 
the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target 
disease relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for 
druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene, 
protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism 
of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other 
types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging 
integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models, 
drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and 
qualities that are at the core of drug discovery. The first version of DTO is 
publically available via the website http://drugtargetontology.org/ , Github ( 
http://github.com/DrugTargetOntology/DTO ), and the NCBO Bioportal ( 
http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DTO ). The long-term goal of DTO is 
to provide such an integrative framework and to populate the ontology with this 
information as a community resource.

The development of improved cancer therapies is frequently cited as an urgent 
unmet medical need. Here we describe how genetic interactions are being 
therapeutically exploited to identify novel targeted treatments for cancer. We 
discuss the current methodologies that use 'omics data to identify genetic 
interactions, in particular focusing on synthetic sickness lethality (SSL) and 
synthetic dosage lethality (SDL). We describe the experimental and computational 
approaches undertaken both in humans and model organisms to identify these 
interactions. Finally we discuss some of the identified targets with licensed 
drugs, inhibitors in clinical trials or with compounds under development.

Bioinformatics approaches are becoming ever more essential in translational drug 
discovery both in academia and within the pharmaceutical industry. Computational 
exploitation of the increasing volumes of data generated during all phases of 
drug discovery is enabling key challenges of the process to be addressed. Here, 
we highlight some of the areas in which bioinformatics resources and methods are 
being developed to support the drug discovery pipeline. These include the 
creation of large data warehouses, bioinformatics algorithms to analyse 'big 
data' that identify novel drug targets and/or biomarkers, programs to assess the 
tractability of targets, and prediction of repositioning opportunities that use 
licensed drugs to treat additional indications.

MOTIVATION: The increasing amount of peer-reviewed manuscripts requires the 
development of specific mining tools to facilitate the visual exploration of 
evidence linking diseases and proteins.
RESULTS: We developed TIN-X, the Target Importance and Novelty eXplorer, to 
visualize the association between proteins and diseases, based on text mining 
data processed from scientific literature. In the current implementation, TIN-X 
supports exploration of data for G-protein coupled receptors, kinases, ion 
channels, and nuclear receptors. TIN-X supports browsing and navigating across 
proteins and diseases based on ontology classes, and displays a scatter plot 
with two proposed new bibliometric statistics: Importance and Novelty.

ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactivity data on small drug-like 
molecules, used by drug discovery scientists. Among many access methods, a REST 
API provides programmatic access, allowing the remote retrieval of ChEMBL data 
and its integration into other applications. This approach allows scientists to 
move from a world where they go to the ChEMBL web site to search for relevant 
data, to one where ChEMBL data can be simply integrated into their everyday 
tools and work environment. Areas covered: This review highlights some of the 
audiences who may benefit from using the ChEMBL API, and the goals they can 
address, through the description of several use cases. The examples cover a team 
communication tool (Slack), a data analytics platform (KNIME), batch job 
management software (Luigi) and Rich Internet Applications. Expert opinion: The 
advent of web technologies, cloud computing and micro services oriented 
architectures have made REST APIs an essential ingredient of modern software 
development models. The widespread availability of tools consuming RESTful 
resources have made them useful for many groups of users. The ChEMBL API is a 
valuable resource of drug discovery bioactivity data for professional chemists, 
chemistry students, data scientists, scientific and web developers.

The 'druggable genome' encompasses several protein families, but only a subset 
of targets within them have attracted significant research attention and thus 
have information about them publicly available. The Illuminating the Druggable 
Genome (IDG) program was initiated in 2014, has the goal of developing 
experimental techniques and a Knowledge Management Center (KMC) that would 
collect and organize information about protein targets from four families, 
representing the most common druggable targets with an emphasis on understudied 
proteins. Here, we describe two resources developed by the KMC: the Target 
Central Resource Database (TCRD) which collates many heterogeneous gene/protein 
datasets and Pharos (https://pharos.nih.gov), a multimodal web interface that 
presents the data from TCRD. We briefly describe the types and sources of data 
considered by the KMC and then highlight features of the Pharos interface 
designed to enable intuitive access to the IDG knowledgebase. The aim of Pharos 
is to encourage 'serendipitous browsing', whereby related, relevant information 
is made easily discoverable. We conclude by describing two use cases that 
highlight the utility of Pharos and TCRD.

ChEMBL is an open large-scale bioactivity database 
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl), previously described in the 2012 and 2014 
Nucleic Acids Research Database Issues. Since then, alongside the continued 
extraction of data from the medicinal chemistry literature, new sources of 
bioactivity data have also been added to the database. These include: deposited 
data sets from neglected disease screening; crop protection data; drug 
metabolism and disposition data and bioactivity data from patents. A number of 
improvements and new features have also been incorporated. These include the 
annotation of assays and targets using ontologies, the inclusion of targets and 
indications for clinical candidates, addition of metabolic pathways for drugs 
and calculation of structural alerts. The ChEMBL data can be accessed via a 
web-interface, RDF distribution, data downloads and RESTful web-services.

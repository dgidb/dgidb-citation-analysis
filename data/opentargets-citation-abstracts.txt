Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an aggressive interstitial lung disease 
with a high mortality rate. Putative drug targets in IPF have failed to 
translate into effective therapies at the clinical level. We identify TRAF2- and 
NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK) as an anti-fibrotic target using a predictive 
artificial intelligence (AI) approach. Using AI-driven methodology, we generated 
INS018_055, a small-molecule TNIK inhibitor, which exhibits desirable drug-like 
properties and anti-fibrotic activity across different organs in vivo through 
oral, inhaled or topical administration. INS018_055 possesses anti-inflammatory 
effects in addition to its anti-fibrotic profile, validated in multiple in vivo 
studies. Its safety and tolerability as well as pharmacokinetics were validated 
in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial 
(NCT05154240) involving 78 healthy participants. A separate phase I trial in 
China, CTR20221542, also demonstrated comparable safety and pharmacokinetic 
profiles. This work was completed in roughly 18 months from target discovery to 
preclinical candidate nomination and demonstrates the capabilities of our 
generative AI-driven drug-discovery pipeline.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease that represents an 
important cause of morbidity and mortality, yet causal mechanisms remain largely 
elusive. Here, we perform a large-scale genome-wide association study and 
multitrait analysis for DCM using 9,365 cases and 946,368 controls. We identify 
70 genome-wide significant loci, which show broad replication in independent 
samples and map to 63 prioritized genes. Tissue, cell type and pathway 
enrichment analyses highlight the central role of the cardiomyocyte and 
contractile apparatus in DCM pathogenesis. Polygenic risk scores constructed 
from our genome-wide association study predict DCM across different ancestry 
groups, show differing contributions to DCM depending on rare pathogenic variant 
status and associate with systolic heart failure across various clinical 
settings. Mendelian randomization analyses reveal actionable potential causes of 
DCM, including higher bodyweight and higher systolic blood pressure. Our 
findings provide insights into the genetic architecture and mechanisms 
underlying DCM and myocardial function more broadly.

Immune signalling is a crucial component in the progression of fibrosis. 
However, approaches for the safety assessment of potentially profibrotic 
substances, that provide information on mechanistic immune responses, are 
underdeveloped. This study aimed to develop a novel framework for assessing the 
immunotoxicity of fibrotic compounds. We exposed macrophages in vitro to 
multiple sublethal concentrations of the profibrotic agent bleomycin, over 
multiple timepoints, and generated RNA sequencing data. Using a toxicogenomic 
approach, we performed dose-dependent analysis to discover genes dysregulated by 
bleomycin exposure in a dose-responsive manner. A subset of immune genes 
displayed a sustained dose-dependent and differential expression response to 
profibrotic challenge. An immunoassay revealed cytokines and proteinases 
responding to bleomycin exposure that closely correlated to transcriptomic 
alterations, underscoring the integration between transcriptional immune 
response and external immune signalling activity. This study not only increases 
our understanding of the immunological mechanisms of fibrosis, but also offers 
an innovative framework for the toxicological evaluation of substances with 
potential fibrogenic effects on macrophage signalling. Our work brings a new 
immunotoxicogenomic direction for hazard assessment of fibrotic compounds, 
through the implementation of a time and resource efficient in vitro 
methodology.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds 
of type 2 diabetes loci, with the vast majority of signals located in non-coding 
regions; as a consequence, it remains largely unclear which 'effector' genes 
these variants influence. Determining these effector genes has been hampered by 
the relatively challenging cellular settings in which they are hypothesised to 
confer their effects.
METHODS: To implicate such effector genes, we elected to generate and integrate 
high-resolution promoter-focused Capture-C, assay for transposase-accessible 
chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq datasets to characterise 
chromatin and expression profiles in multiple cell lines relevant to type 2 
diabetes for subsequent functional follow-up analyses: EndoC-BH1 (pancreatic 
beta cell), HepG2 (hepatocyte) and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS; 
adipocyte).
RESULTS: The subsequent variant-to-gene analysis implicated 810 candidate 
effector genes at 370 type 2 diabetes risk loci. Using partitioned linkage 
disequilibrium score regression, we observed enrichment for type 2 diabetes and 
fasting glucose GWAS loci in promoter-connected putative cis-regulatory elements 
in EndoC-BH1 cells as well as fasting insulin GWAS loci in SGBS cells. Moreover, 
as a proof of principle, when we knocked down expression of the SMCO4 gene in 
EndoC-BH1 cells, we observed a statistically significant increase in insulin 
secretion.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results provide a resource for comparing 
tissue-specific data in tractable cellular models as opposed to relatively 
challenging primary cell settings.

PURPOSE: Target-based strategy is a prevalent means of drug research and 
development (R&D), since targets provide effector molecules of drug action and 
offer the foundation of pharmacological investigation. Recently, the artificial 
intelligence (AI) technology has been utilized in various stages of drug R&D, 
where AI-assisted experimental methods show higher efficiency than sole 
experimental ones. It is a critical need to give a comprehensive review of AI 
applications in drug R &D for biopharmaceutical field.
METHODS: Relevant literatures about AI-assisted drug R&D were collected from the 
public databases (Including Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE Xplore 
Digital Library, Springer, and ScienceDirect) through a keyword searching 
strategy with the following terms [("Artificial Intelligence" OR "Knowledge 
Graph" OR "Machine Learning") AND ("Drug Target Identification" OR "New Drug 
Development")].
RESULTS: In this review, we first introduced common strategies and novel trends 
of drug R&D, followed by characteristic description of AI algorithms widely used 
in drug R&D. Subsequently, we depicted detailed applications of AI algorithms in 
target identification, lead compound identification and optimization, drug 
repurposing, and drug analytical platform construction. Finally, we discussed 
the challenges and prospects of AI-assisted methods for drug discovery.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, this review provides comprehensive overview of AI 
applications in drug R&D and presents future perspectives for biopharmaceutical 
field, which may promote the development of drug industry.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to dementia and 
poses a serious threat to the health of the elderly. Traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) presents as a promising novel therapeutic therapy for preventing 
and treating dementia. Studies have shown that natural products derived from 
kidney-tonifying herbs can effectively inhibit AD. Furthermore, endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress is a critical factor in the pathology of AD. Regulation of 
ER stress is a crucial approach to prevent and treat AD. Thus, in this study, we 
first collected kidney-tonifying herbs, integrated chemical ingredients from 
multiple TCM databases, and constructed a comprehensive drug-target network. 
Subsequently, we employed the endophenotype network (network proximity) method 
to identify potential active ingredients in kidney-tonifying herbs that 
prevented AD via regulating ER stress. By combining the predicted outcomes, we 
discovered that 32 natural products could ameliorate AD pathology via regulating 
ER stress. After a comprehensive evaluation of the multi-network model and 
systematic pharmacological analyses, we further selected several promising 
compounds for in vitro testing in the APP-SH-SY5Y cell model. Experimental 
results showed that echinacoside and danthron were able to effectively reduce ER 
stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the expression levels of BIP, 
p-PERK, ATF6, and CHOP in APP-SH-SY5Y cells. Overall, this study utilized the 
endophenotype network to preliminarily decipher the effective material basis and 
potential molecular mechanism of kidney-tonifying Chinese medicine for 
prevention and treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function (LOF) alterations in tumour suppressor genes cannot 
be directly targeted. Approaches characterising gene function and 
vulnerabilities conferred by such mutations are required.
METHODS: Here, we computationally map genetic networks of KMT2D, a tumour 
suppressor gene frequently mutated in several cancer types. Using KMT2D 
loss-of-function (KMT2DLOF) mutations as a model, we illustrate the utility of 
in silico genetic networks in uncovering novel functional associations and 
vulnerabilities in cancer cells with LOF alterations affecting tumour suppressor 
genes.
RESULTS: We revealed genetic interactors with functions in histone modification, 
metabolism, and immune response and synthetic lethal (SL) candidates, including 
some encoding existing therapeutic targets. Notably, we predicted WRN as a novel 
SL interactor and, using recently available WRN inhibitor (HRO761 and 
VVD-133214) treatment response data, we observed that KMT2D mutational status 
significantly distinguishes treatment-sensitive MSI cell lines from 
treatment-insensitive MSI cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study thus illustrates how tumour suppressor gene LOF 
alterations can be exploited to reveal potentially targetable cancer cell 
vulnerabilities.

BACKGROUND: Target identification and hit identification can be transformed 
through the application of biomedical knowledge analysis, AI-driven virtual 
screening and robotic cloud lab systems. However there are few prospective 
studies that evaluate the efficacy of such integrated approaches.
RESULTS: We synergistically integrate our in-house-developed target evaluation 
(SpectraView) and deep-learning-driven virtual screening (HydraScreen) tools 
with an automated robotic cloud lab designed explicitly for 
ultra-high-throughput screening, enabling us to validate these platforms 
experimentally. By employing our target evaluation tool to select IRAK1 as the 
focal point of our investigation, we prospectively validate our structure-based 
deep learning model. We can identify 23.8% of all IRAK1 hits within the top 1% 
of ranked compounds. The model outperforms traditional virtual screening 
techniques and offers advanced features such as ligand pose confidence scoring. 
Simultaneously, we identify three potent (nanomolar) scaffolds from our compound 
library, 2 of which represent novel candidates for IRAK1 and hold promise for 
future development.
CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling evidence for SpectraView and 
HydraScreen to provide a significant acceleration in the processes of target 
identification and hit discovery. By leveraging Ro5's HydraScreen and Strateos' 
automated labs in hit identification for IRAK1, we show how AI-driven virtual 
screening with HydraScreen could offer high hit discovery rates and reduce 
experimental costs.
SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: We present an innovative platform that leverages 
Knowledge graph-based biomedical data analytics and AI-driven virtual screening 
integrated with robotic cloud labs. Through an unbiased, prospective evaluation 
we show the reliability and robustness of HydraScreen in virtual and 
high-throughput screening for hit identification in IRAK1. Our platforms and 
innovative tools can expedite the early stages of drug discovery.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, immensely complex 
neurodegenerative disease by lack of effective treatments. We developed a 
network medicine methodology via integrating human brain multi-omics data to 
prioritize drug targets and repurposable treatments for ALS. We leveraged 
non-coding ALS loci effects from genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) on human 
brain expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) (eQTL), protein QTL (pQTL), 
splicing QTL (sQTL), methylation QTL (meQTL), and histone acetylation QTL 
(haQTL). Using a network-based deep learning framework, we identified 105 
putative ALS-associated genes enriched in known ALS pathobiological pathways. 
Applying network proximity analysis of predicted ALS-associated genes and 
drug-target networks under the human protein-protein interactome (PPI) model, we 
identified potential repurposable drugs (i.e., Diazoxide and Gefitinib) for ALS. 
Subsequent validation established preclinical evidence for top-prioritized 
drugs. In summary, we presented a network-based multi-omics framework to 
identify drug targets and repurposable treatments for ALS and other 
neurodegenerative disease if broadly applied.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related 
mortality worldwide. This study investigates the role and mechanisms of ADAM9 as 
a biomarker and potential therapeutic target in HCC. Utilizing RNA-sequencing 
data and clinicopathological characteristics from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, we conducted survival and 
meta-analyses, functional enrichment, and immune infiltration studies. 
Additionally, we evaluated the effects of ADAM9 silencing on HCC cell 
proliferation, migration, and invasion through in vitro experiments. Our results 
demonstrate that high ADAM9 expression is associated with poor prognosis and 
increased immune infiltration in HCC patients. Furthermore, ADAM9 knockdown 
significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration. These findings 
indicate that ADAM9 is a promising prognostic biomarker and potential 
therapeutic target in HCC. In conclusion, ADAM9 could offer avenues for 
developing strategies to inhibit tumor progression and improve patient outcomes.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and a leading cause of 
pain and disability in adults. A central feature is progressive cartilage 
degradation and matrix fragment formation driven by the excessive production of 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-13, by articular chondrocytes. 
Inflammatory factors, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), are secreted into the 
joint by synovial fibroblasts, and can contribute to pain and inflammation. No 
therapeutic exists that addresses the underlying loss of joint tissue in OA. To 
address this, we developed and utilized a cell-based high-throughput OA drug 
discovery platform using normal human chondrocytes treated with a recombinant 
fragment of the matrix protein fibronectin (FN-f) as a catabolic stimulus 
relevant to OA pathogenesis and a readout using a fluorescent MMP-13 responsive 
probe. The goal was to test this screening platform by identifying compounds 
that inhibited FN-f-induced MMP-13 production and determine if these compounds 
also inhibited catabolic signaling in OA chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts. 
Two pilot screens of 1344 small molecules revealed five "hits" that strongly 
inhibited FN-f induced MMP-13 production with low cytotoxicity. These included 
RO-3306 (CDK1 inhibitor (i)), staurosporine (PKCi), trametinib (MEK1 and MEK2i), 
GSK-626616 (DYRK3i), and edicotinib (CSF-1Ri). Secondary testing using 
immunoblots and cells derived from OA joint tissues confirmed the ability of 
selected compounds to inhibit chondrocyte MMP-13 production and FN-f stimulated 
IL-6 production by synovial fibroblasts. These findings support the use of this 
high throughput screening assay for discovery of disease-modifying 
osteoarthritis drugs.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a debilitating condition with 
limited treatments and additional therapeutic targets needed. Identifying AD 
protective genetic loci may identify new targets and accelerate identification 
of therapeutic treatments. We examined a founder population to identify loci 
associated with cognitive preservation into advanced age.
METHODS: Genome-wide association and linkage analyses were performed on 946 
examined and sampled Amish individuals, aged 76-95, who were either cognitively 
unimpaired (CU) or impaired (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated 
suggestive association (P ≤ 5 × 10-4) with cognitive preservation. Genetic 
linkage analyses identified > 100 significant (logarithm of the odds 
[LOD] ≥ 3.3) SNPs, some which overlapped with the association results. Only one 
locus on chromosome 2 retained significance across multiple analyses.
DISCUSSION: A novel significant result for cognitive preservation on chromosome 
2 includes the genes LRRTM4 and CTNNA2. Additionally, the lead SNP, rs1402906, 
impacts the POU3F2 transcription factor binding affinity, which regulates LRRTM4 
and CTNNA2.
HIGHLIGHTS: GWAS and linkage identified over 100 loci associated with cognitive 
preservation. One locus on Chromosome 2 retained significance over multiple 
analyses. Predicted TFBSs near rs1402906 regulate genes associated with 
neurocognition.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex hereditary condition comprising various 
metabolic traits as risk factors. Although the genetics of individual MetS 
components have been investigated actively through large-scale genome-wide 
association studies, the conjoint genetic architecture has not been fully 
elucidated. Here, we performed the largest multivariate genome-wide association 
study of MetS in Europe (nobserved = 4,947,860) by leveraging genetic 
correlation between MetS components. We identified 1,307 genetic loci associated 
with MetS that were enriched primarily in brain tissues. Using transcriptomic 
data, we identified 11 genes associated strongly with MetS. Our phenome-wide 
association and Mendelian randomization analyses highlighted associations of 
MetS with diverse diseases beyond cardiometabolic diseases. Polygenic risk score 
analysis demonstrated better discrimination of MetS and predictive power in 
European and East Asian populations. Altogether, our findings will guide future 
studies aimed at elucidating the genetic architecture of MetS.

The present study aimed to investigate the chemical profile, antioxidant, and 
enzyme inhibition properties of extracts from fruits and aerial parts (leaves 
and twigs) of Tamarix aphylla and T. senegalensis. Hexane, dichloromethane, 
ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and methanol extracts were prepared sequentially by 
maceration. Results revealed that EtOAc extracts of T. senegalensis and T. 
aphylla fruits contained the highest total phenolic content (113.74 and 
111.21 mg GAE/g) while that of T. senegalensis (38.47 mg RE/g) recorded the 
highest total flavonoids content. Among the quantified compounds; ellagic, 
gallic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric acids, isorhamnetin, 
procyanidin B2, and kaempferol were the most abundant compounds in the two 
species. EtOAc extracts of the two organs of T. senegalensis in addition to MeOH 
extract of T. aphylla aerial parts displayed the highest chelating power 
(21.00-21.30 mg EDTAE/g, p > 0.05). The highest anti-AChE (3.11 mg GALAE/g) and 
anti-BChE (3.62 mg GALAE/g) activities were recorded from the hexane and EtOAc 
extracts of T. senegalensis aerial parts and fruits, respectively. EtOAc 
extracts of the fruits of the two species exerted the highest anti-tyrosinase 
(anti-Tyr) activity (99.44 and 98.65 mg KAE/g, p > 0.05). Also, the EtOAc 
extracts of the both organs of the two species exhibited highest 
anti-glucosidase activity (0.88-0.90 mmol ACAE/g, p > 0.05) while the best 
anti-α-amylase activity was recorded from the dichloromethane extract of T. 
senegalensis fruits (0.74 mmol ACAE/g). In this study, network pharmacology was 
employed to examine the connection between compounds from Tamarix and their 
potential effectiveness against Alzheimer's disease. The compounds demonstrated 
potential interactions with pivotal genes including APP, GSK3B, and CDK5, 
indicating a therapeutic potential. Molecular docking was carried out to 
understand the binding mode and interaction of the compounds with the target 
enzymes. Key interactions observed, such as H-bonds, promoted the binding, and 
weaker ones, such as van der Waals attractions, reinforced it. These findings 
suggest that these two Tamarix species possess bioactive properties with 
health-promoting effects.

PWAS (proteome-wide association study) is an innovative genetic association 
approach that complements widely used methods like GWAS (genome-wide association 
study). The PWAS approach involves consecutive phases. Initially, machine 
learning modeling and probabilistic considerations quantify the impact of 
genetic variants on protein-coding genes' biochemical functions. Secondly, for 
each individual, aggregating the variants per gene determines a gene-damaging 
score. Finally, standard statistical tests are activated in the case-control 
setting to yield statistically significant genes per phenotype. The PWAS Hub 
offers a user-friendly interface for an in-depth exploration of gene-disease 
associations from the UK Biobank (UKB). Results from PWAS cover 99 common 
diseases and conditions, each with over 10,000 diagnosed individuals per 
phenotype. Users can explore genes associated with these diseases, with separate 
analyses conducted for males and females. For each phenotype, the analyses 
account for sex-based genetic effects, inheritance modes (dominant and 
recessive), and the pleiotropic nature of associated genes. The PWAS Hub 
showcases its usefulness for asthma by navigating through proteomic-genetic 
analyses. Inspecting PWAS asthma-listed genes (a total of 27) provide insights 
into the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Comparison of 
PWAS-statistically significant genes for common diseases to the Open Targets 
benchmark shows partial but significant overlap in gene associations for most 
phenotypes. Graphical tools facilitate comparing genetic effects between PWAS 
and coding GWAS results, aiding in understanding the sex-specific genetic impact 
on common diseases. This adaptable platform is attractive to clinicians, 
researchers, and individuals interested in delving into gene-disease 
associations and sex-specific genetic effects.

Immunity has shown potentials in informing drug development for cardiometabolic 
diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, 
we performed a transcriptome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to estimate 
the putative causal effects of 11,021 gene expression profiles during CD4+ T 
cells activation on the development of T2D and CAD. Robust MR and colocalization 
evidence was observed for 162 genes altering T2D risk and 80 genes altering CAD 
risk, with 12% and 16% respectively demonstrating CD4+ T cell specificity. We 
observed temporal causal patterns during T cell activation in 69 gene-T2D pairs 
and 34 gene-CAD pairs. These genes were eight times more likely to show robust 
genetic evidence. We further identified 25 genes that were targets for drugs 
under clinical investigation, including LIPA and GCK. This study provides 
evidence to support immune-to-metabolic disease connections, and prioritises 
immune-mediated drug targets for cardiometabolic diseases.

MOTIVATION: Accurate identification of pain-related genes remains challenging 
due to the complex nature of pain pathophysiology and the subjective nature of 
pain reporting in humans. Here, we use machine learning to identify possible 
'pain genes'. Labelling was based on a gold-standard list with validated 
involvement across pain conditions, and was trained on a selection of -omics, 
protein-protein interaction network features, and biological function readouts 
for each gene.
RESULTS: The top-performing model was selected to predict a 'pain score' per 
gene. The top-ranked genes were then validated against pain-related human SNPs. 
Functional analysis revealed JAK2/STAT3 signal, ErbB, and Rap1 signalling 
pathways as promising targets for further exploration, while network topological 
features contribute significantly to the identification of 'pain' genes. As 
such, a network based on top-ranked genes was constructed to reveal previously 
uncharacterized pain-related genes. Together, these novel insights into pain 
pathogenesis can indicate promising directions for future experimental research.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: These analyses can be further explored using 
the linked open-source database at 
https://livedataoxford.shinyapps.io/drg-directory/, which is accompanied by a 
freely accessible code template and user guide for wider adoption across 
disciplines.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease influenced by 
well-established environmental exposures (most notably, cigarette smoking) and 
incompletely defined genetic factors. The chromosome 4q region harbors multiple 
genetic risk loci for COPD, including signals near HHIP, FAM13A, GSTCD, TET2, 
and BTC. Leveraging RNA-Seq data from lung tissue in COPD cases and controls, we 
estimated the co-expression network for genes in the 4q region bounded by HHIP 
and BTC (~70MB), through partial correlations informed by protein-protein 
interactions. We identified several co-expressed gene pairs based on partial 
correlations, including NPNT-HHIP, BTC-NPNT and FAM13A-TET2, which were 
replicated in independent lung tissue cohorts. Upon clustering the co-expression 
network, we observed that four genes previously associated to COPD: BTC, HHIP, 
NPNT and PPM1K appeared in the same network community. Finally, we discovered a 
sub-network of genes differentially co-expressed between COPD vs controls 
(including FAM13A, PPA2, PPM1K and TET2). Many of these genes were previously 
implicated in cell-based knock-out experiments, including the knocking out of 
SPP1 which belongs to the same genomic region and could be a potential local key 
regulatory gene. These analyses identify chromosome 4q as a region enriched for 
COPD genetic susceptibility and differential co-expression.

Identifying genetic drivers of chronic diseases is necessary for drug discovery. 
Here, we develop a machine learning-assisted genetic priority score, which we 
call ML-GPS, that incorporates genetic associations with predicted disease 
phenotypes to enhance target discovery. First, we construct gradient boosting 
models to predict 112 chronic disease phecodes in the UK Biobank and analyze 
associations of predicted and observed phenotypes with common, rare, and 
ultra-rare variants to model the allelic series. We integrate these associations 
with existing evidence using gradient boosting with continuous feature encoding 
to construct ML-GPS, training it to predict drug indications in Open Targets and 
externally testing it in SIDER. We then generate ML-GPS predictions for 
2,362,636 gene-phecode pairs. We find that the use of predicted phenotypes, 
which identify substantially more genetic associations than observed phenotypes 
across the allele frequency spectrum, significantly improves the performance of 
ML-GPS. ML-GPS increases coverage of drug targets, with the top 1% of all scores 
providing support for 15,077 gene-phecode pairs that previously had no support. 
ML-GPS can also identify well-known target-disease relationships, promising 
targets without indicated drugs, and targets for several drugs in clinical 
trials, including LRRK2 inhibitors for Parkinson's disease and olpasiran for 
cardiovascular disease.

Opioid misuse, addiction, and associated overdose deaths remain global public 
health crises. Despite the tremendous need for pharmacological treatments, 
current options are limited in number, use, and effectiveness. Fundamental leaps 
forward in our understanding of the biology driving opioid addiction are needed 
to guide development of more effective medication-assisted therapies. This 
Review focuses on the omics-identified biological features associated with 
opioid addiction. Recent GWAS have begun to identify robust genetic 
associations, including variants in OPRM1, FURIN, and the gene cluster 
SCAI/PPP6C/RABEPK. An increasing number of omics studies of postmortem human 
brain tissue examining biological features (e.g., histone modification and gene 
expression) across different brain regions have identified broad gene 
dysregulation associated with overdose death among opioid misusers. Drawn 
together by meta-analysis and multi-omic systems biology, and informed by model 
organism studies, key biological pathways enriched for opioid 
addiction-associated genes are emerging, which include specific receptors (e.g., 
GABAB receptors, GPCR, and Trk) linked to signaling pathways (e.g., Trk, 
ERK/MAPK, orexin) that are associated with synaptic plasticity and neuronal 
signaling. Studies leveraging the agnostic discovery power of omics and placing 
it within the context of functional neurobiology will propel us toward 
much-needed, field-changing breakthroughs, including identification of 
actionable targets for drug development to treat this devastating brain disease.

Decades of genetic association testing in human cohorts have provided important 
insights into the genetic architecture and biological underpinnings of complex 
traits and diseases. However, for certain traits, genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) for common SNPs are approaching signal saturation, which 
underscores the need to explore other types of genetic variation to understand 
the genetic basis of traits and diseases. Copy number variation (CNV) is an 
important source of heritability that is well known to functionally affect human 
traits. Recent technological and computational advances enable the large-scale, 
genome-wide evaluation of CNVs, with implications for downstream applications 
such as polygenic risk scoring and drug target identification. Here, we review 
the current state of CNV-GWAS, discuss current limitations in resource 
infrastructure that need to be overcome to enable the wider uptake of CNV-GWAS 
results, highlight emerging opportunities and suggest guidelines and standards 
for future GWAS for genetic variation beyond SNPs at scale.

Background/Objectives: Breast cancer is diagnosed in 2.3 million women each year 
and kills 685,000 (~30% of patients) worldwide. The prognosis for many breast 
cancer subtypes has improved due to treatments targeting the estrogen receptor 
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2). In contrast, patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors, 
which lack all three commonly targeted membrane markers, more frequently relapse 
and have lower survival rates due to a lack of tumor-selective TNBC treatments. 
We aim to investigate TNBC mechanistic markers that could be targeted for 
treatment. Methods: We performed a secondary TNBC analysis of 196 samples across 
10 publicly available bulk RNA-sequencing studies to better understand the 
molecular mechanism(s) of disease and predict robust mechanistic markers that 
could be used to improve the mechanistic understanding of and diagnostic 
capabilities for TNBC. Results: Our analysis identified ~12,500 significant 
differentially expressed genes (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05), including KIF14 
and ELMOD3, and two significantly modulated pathways. Additionally, our novel 
findings include highly accurate mechanistic markers identified using machine 
learning methods, including CIDEC (97.1% accuracy alone), CD300LG, ASPM, and 
RGS1 (98.9% combined accuracy), as well as TNBC subtype-differentiating 
mechanistic markers, including the targets PDE3B, CFD, IFNG, and ADM, which have 
associated therapeutics that can potentially be repurposed to improve treatment 
options. We then experimentally and computationally validated a subset of these 
findings. Conclusions: The results of our analyses can be used to better 
understand the mechanism(s) of disease and contribute to the development of 
improved diagnostics and/or treatments for TNBC.

The basal ganglia are subcortical brain structures involved in motor control, 
cognition, and emotion regulation. We conducted univariate and multivariate 
genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) to explore the genetic architecture of 
basal ganglia volumes using brain scans obtained from 34,794 Europeans with 
replication in 4,808 white and generalization in 5,220 non-white Europeans. Our 
multivariate GWAS identified 72 genetic loci associated with basal ganglia 
volumes with a replication rate of 55.6% at P < 0.05 and 87.5% showed the same 
direction, revealing a distributed genetic architecture across basal ganglia 
structures. Of these, 50 loci were novel, including exonic regions of APOE, NBR1 
and HLAA. We examined the genetic overlap between basal ganglia volumes and 
several neurological and psychiatric disorders. The strongest genetic overlap 
was between basal ganglia and Parkinson's disease, as supported by robust 
LD-score regression-based genetic correlations. Mendelian randomization 
indicated genetic liability to larger striatal volume as potentially causal for 
Parkinson's disease, in addition to a suggestive causal effect of greater 
genetic liability to Alzheimer's disease on smaller accumbens. Functional 
analyses implicated neurogenesis, neuron differentiation and development in 
basal ganglia volumes. These results enhance our understanding of the genetic 
architecture and molecular associations of basal ganglia structure and their 
role in brain disorders.

Broad-capture proteomic platforms now enable simultaneous assessment of 
thousands of plasma proteins, but most of these are not actively secreted and 
their origins are largely unknown. Here we integrate genomic with deep phenomic 
information to identify modifiable and non-modifiable factors associated with 
4,775 plasma proteins in ~8,000 mostly healthy individuals. We create a 
data-driven map of biological influences on the human plasma proteome and 
demonstrate segregation of proteins into clusters based on major explanatory 
factors. For over a third (N = 1,575) of protein targets, joint genetic and 
non-genetic factors explain 10-77% of the variation in plasma (median 19.88%, 
interquartile range 14.01-31.09%), independent of technical factors (median 
2.48%, interquartile range 0.78-6.41%). Together with genetically anchored 
causal inference methods, our map highlights potential causal associations 
between modifiable risk factors and plasma proteins for hundreds of 
protein-disease associations, for example, COL6A3, which possibly mediates the 
association between reduced kidney function and cardiovascular disease. We 
provide a map of biological and technical influences on the human plasma 
proteome to help contextualize findings from proteomic studies.

Genome-wide association studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) have identified 170 
autosomal risk loci. However, for most of these, the functional variants and 
their target genes are unknown. Here, we perform statistical fine-mapping 
incorporating tissue-specific epigenetic annotations and massively parallel 
reporter assays to systematically prioritize functional variants for each CRC 
risk locus. We identify plausible causal variants for the 170 risk loci, with a 
single variant for 40. We link these variants to 208 target genes by analyzing 
colon-specific quantitative trait loci and implementing the activity-by-contact 
model, which integrates epigenomic features and Micro-C data, to predict 
enhancer-gene connections. By deciphering CRC risk loci, we identify direct 
links between risk variants and target genes, providing further insight into the 
molecular basis of CRC susceptibility and highlighting potential pharmaceutical 
targets for prevention and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Genetics has the potential to inform biologically relevant drug 
treatment and repurposing which may ultimately improve patient care. In this 
study, we combine methods which leverage the genetics of psychiatric disorders 
to prioritize potential drug targets and compounds.
METHODS: We used the largest available genome-wide association studies, in 
European ancestry, of four psychiatric disorders [i.e., attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia] 
along with genes encoding drug targets. With this data, we conducted drug 
enrichment analyses incorporating the novel and biologically specific GSA-MiXeR 
tool. We then conducted a series of molecular trait analyses using large-scale 
transcriptomic and proteomic datasets sampled from brain and blood tissue. This 
included the novel use of the UK Biobank proteomic data for a proteome-wide 
association study of psychiatric disorders. With the accumulated evidence, we 
prioritize potential drug targets and compounds for each disorder.
FINDINGS: We reveal candidate drug targets shared across multiple disorders as 
well as disorder-specific targets. Drug prioritization indicated genetic support 
for several currently used psychotropic medications including the antipsychotic 
paliperidone as the top ranked drug for schizophrenia. We also observed genetic 
support for other commonly used psychotropics (e.g., clozapine, risperidone, 
duloxetine, lithium, and valproic acid). Opportunities for drug repurposing were 
revealed such as cholinergic drugs for ADHD, estrogens for depression, and 
gabapentin enacarbil for schizophrenia. Our findings also indicate the genetic 
liability to schizophrenia is associated with reduced brain and blood expression 
of CYP2D6, a gene encoding a metabolizer of drugs and neurotransmitters, 
suggesting a genetic risk for poor drug response and altered neurotransmission.
INTERPRETATION: Here we present a series of complimentary and comprehensive 
analyses that highlight the utility of genetics for informing drug development 
and repurposing for psychiatric disorders. Our findings present novel 
opportunities for refining psychiatric treatment.

Gene-gene (GxG) interactions play an important role in human genetics, 
potentially explaining part of the "missing heritability" of polygenic traits 
and the variable expressivity of monogenic traits. Many GxG interactions have 
been identified in model organisms through experimental breeding studies, but 
they have been difficult to identify in human populations. To address this 
challenge, we applied two complementary variance QTL (vQTL)-based approaches to 
identify GxG interactions that contribute to human blood traits and 
blood-related disease risk. First, we used the previously validated genome-wide 
scale test for each trait in ~450,000 people in the UK Biobank and identified 4 
vQTLs. Genome-wide GxG interaction testing of these vQTLs enabled discovery of 
novel interactions between (1) CCL24 and CCL26 for eosinophil count and plasma 
CCL24 and CCL26 protein levels and (2) HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 for lymphocyte 
count and risk of celiac disease, both of which replicated in ~140,000 NIH All 
of Us and ~70,000 Vanderbilt BioVU participants. Second, we used a biologically 
informed approach to search for vQTL in disease-relevant genes. This approach 
identified (1) a known interaction for hemoglobin between two pathogenic 
variants in HFE which cause hereditary hemochromatosis and alters risk of 
cirrhosis and (2) a novel interaction between the JAK2 46/1 haplotype and a 
variant on chromosome 14 which modifies platelet count, JAK2 V617F clonal 
hematopoiesis, and risk of polycythemia vera. This work identifies novel 
disease-relevant GxG interactions and demonstrates the utility of vQTL-based 
approaches in identifying GxG interactions relevant to human health at scale.

Cancer is a subject of extensive investigation, and the utilization of omics 
technology has resulted in the generation of substantial volumes of big data in 
cancer research. Numerous databases are being developed to manage and organize 
this data effectively. These databases encompass various domains such as 
genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, immunology, and drug 
discovery. The application of computational tools into various core components 
of pharmaceutical sciences constitutes "Pharmacoinformatics", an emerging 
paradigm in rational drug discovery. The three major features of 
pharmacoinformatics include (i) Structure modelling of putative drugs and 
targets, (ii) Compilation of databases and analysis using statistical 
approaches, and (iii) Employing artificial intelligence/machine learning 
algorithms for the discovery of novel therapeutic molecules. The development, 
updating, and analysis of databases using statistical approaches play a pivotal 
role in pharmacoinformatics. Multiple software tools are associated with 
oncoinformatics research. This review catalogs the databases and computational 
tools related to cancer drug discovery and highlights their potential 
implications in the pharmacoinformatics of cancer.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) and B-cell lymphoma 
(lymphoma) co-occur at higher-than-expected rates and primarily depend on B 
cells for their pathology. These observations implicate shared 
inflammation-related B cell molecular mechanisms as a potential cause of 
co-occurrence.
METHODS: We consequently implemented a novel Immune Imbalance Transcriptomics 
(IIT) algorithm and applied IIT to lupus, lymphoma, and healthy B cell 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data to find shared and contrasting mechanisms that are 
potential therapeutic targets.
RESULTS: We observed 7143 significantly dysregulated genes in both lupus and 
lymphoma. Of those genes, we found 5137 to have a significant immune imbalance, 
defined as a significant dysregulation by both diseases, as analyzed by IIT. 
Gene Ontology (GO) term and pathway enrichment of the IIT genes yielded 
immune-related "Neutrophil Degranulation" and "Adaptive Immune System", which 
validates that the IIT algorithm isolates biologically relevant genes in 
immunity and inflammation. We found that 344 IIT gene products are known targets 
for established and/or repurposed drugs. Among our results, we found 48 known 
and 296 novel lupus targets, along with 151 known and 193 novel lymphoma 
targets. Known disease drug targets in our IIT results further validate that IIT 
isolates genes with disease-relevant mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate the IIT algorithm, together with the shared and 
contrasting gene mechanisms uncovered here, will contribute to the development 
of immune-related therapeutic options for lupus and lymphoma patients.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable mental illness with complex etiology. While 
the largest published genome-wide association study identified 64 BD risk loci, 
the causal SNPs and genes within these loci remain unknown. We applied a suite 
of statistical and functional fine-mapping methods to these loci, and 
prioritized 17 likely causal SNPs for BD. We mapped these SNPs to genes, and 
investigated their likely functional consequences by integrating variant 
annotations, brain cell-type epigenomic annotations, brain quantitative trait 
loci, and results from rare variant exome sequencing in BD. Convergent lines of 
evidence supported the roles of genes involved in neurotransmission and 
neurodevelopment including SCN2A, TRANK1, DCLK3, INSYN2B, SYNE1, THSD7A, 
CACNA1B, TUBBP5, PLCB3, PRDX5, KCNK4, CRTC3, AP001453.3, TRPT1, FKBP2, DNAJC4, 
RASGRP1, FURIN, FES, DPH1, GSDMB, MED24 and THRA in BD. These represent 
promising candidates for functional experiments to understand biological 
mechanisms and therapeutic potential. Additionally, we demonstrated that 
fine-mapping effect sizes can improve performance of BD polygenic risk scores 
across diverse populations, and present a high-throughput fine-mapping pipeline 
(https://github.com/mkoromina/SAFFARI).

Based on data from the Global Cancer Statistics 2022, lung cancer stands as the 
most lethal cancer worldwide, with age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates of 
23.6 and 16.9 per 100,000 people, respectively. Despite significant strides in 
precision oncology driven by large-scale international research consortia, there 
remains a critical need to deepen our understanding of the genomic landscape 
across diverse racial and ethnic groups. To address this challenge, we performed 
comprehensive in silico analyses and data mining to identify pathogenic variants 
in genes that drive lung cancer. We subsequently calculated the allele 
frequencies and assessed the deleteriousness of these oncogenic variants among 
populations such as African, Amish, Ashkenazi Jewish, East and South Asian, 
Finnish and non-Finnish European, Latino, and Middle Eastern. Our analysis 
examined 117,707 variants within 86 lung cancer-associated genes across 75,109 
human genomes, uncovering 8042 variants that are known or predicted to be 
pathogenic. We prioritized variants based on their allele frequencies and 
deleterious scores, and identified those with potential significance for 
response to anti-cancer therapies through in silico drug simulations, current 
clinical pharmacogenomic guidelines, and ongoing late-stage clinical trials 
targeting lung cancer-driving proteins. In conclusion, it is crucial to unite 
global efforts to create public health policies that emphasize prevention 
strategies and ensure access to clinical trials, pharmacogenomic testing, and 
cancer research for these groups in developed nations.

Family-based heritability estimates of complex traits are often considerably 
larger than their single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability estimates. 
This discrepancy may be due to non-additive effects of genetic variation, 
including variation that interacts with other genes or environmental factors to 
influence the trait. Variance-based procedures provide a computationally 
efficient strategy to screen for SNPs with potential interaction effects without 
requiring the specification of the interacting variable. While valuable, such 
variance-based tests consider only a single trait and ignore likely pleiotropy 
among related traits that, if present, could improve power to detect such 
interaction effects. To fill this gap, we propose SCAMPI (Scalable Cauchy 
Aggregate test using Multiple Phenotypes to test Interactions), which screens 
for variants with interaction effects across multiple traits. SCAMPI is 
motivated by the observation that SNPs with pleiotropic interaction effects 
induce genotypic differences in the patterns of correlation among traits. By 
studying such patterns across genotype categories among multiple traits, we show 
that SCAMPI has improved performance over traditional univariate variance-based 
methods. Like those traditional variance-based tests, SCAMPI permits the 
screening of interaction effects without requiring the specification of the 
interaction variable and is further computationally scalable to biobank data. We 
employed SCAMPI to screen for interacting SNPs associated with four 
lipid-related traits in the UK Biobank and identified multiple gene regions 
missed by existing univariate variance-based tests. SCAMPI is implemented in 
software for public use.

Agarwood, a precious traditional medicinal herb and fragrant material, is known 
for its sedative and sleep-improving properties. This study explores the 
mechanisms underlying the aromatherapy effects of Chi-Nan agarwood and ordinary 
agarwood in improving sleep. Using a combination of gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS), network pharmacology, and molecular docking techniques, we 
identified and c ompared the chemical compositions and potential molecular 
targets of both types of agarwood. The GC-MS analysis detected 87 volatile 
components across six types of agarwood aromatherapy, with 51 shared between 
Chi-Nan and ordinary agarwood, while each type also had 18 unique components. 
Ordinary agarwood was found to be richer in sesquiterpenes and small aromatic 
molecules, whereas Chi-Nan agarwood contained higher levels of chromones. These 
differences in chemical composition are likely responsible for the distinct 
sleep-improving effects observed between the two types of agarwood. Through 
network pharmacology, 100, 65, and 47 non-repetitive target genes related to 
sleep improvement were identified for components shared by both types of 
agarwood (CSBTs), components unique to common agarwood (CUCMs), and components 
unique to Chi-Nan agarwood (CUCNs), respectively. The constructed 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks revealed that key targets such as 
MAOA, MAOB, SLC6A4, and ESR1 are involved in the sleep-improving mechanisms of 
agarwood aromatherapy. Molecular docking further confirmed the strong binding 
affinities of major active components, such as 
5-Isopropylidene-6-methyldeca-369-trien-2-one and 2-(2-Phenylethyl)chromone, 
with these core targets. The results suggest that agarwood aromatherapy enhances 
sleep quality through both hormonal and neurotransmitter pathways, with ordinary 
agarwood more deeply mediating hormonal regulation, while Chi-Nan agarwood 
predominantly influences neurotransmitter pathways, particularly those involving 
serotonin and GABA. This study provides valuable insights into the distinct 
therapeutic potentials of Chi-Nan and ordinary agarwood, highlighting their 
roles in sleep improvement and offering a foundation for future research in the 
clinical application of agarwood-based aromatherapy.

Plasma proteomics is a precious tool in human disease research but requires 
extensive sample preparation in order to perform in-depth analysis and biomarker 
discovery using traditional data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Here, we highlight 
the efficacy of combining moderate plasma prefractionation and data-independent 
acquisition (DIA) to significantly improve proteome coverage and depth while 
remaining cost-efficient. Using human plasma collected from a 20-patient 
COVID-19 cohort, our method utilizes commonly available solutions for depletion, 
sample preparation, and fractionation, followed by 3 liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry/MS (LC-MS/MS) injections for a 360 min total DIA run time. We 
detect 1321 proteins on average per patient and 2031 unique proteins across the 
cohort. Differential analysis further demonstrates the applicability of this 
method for plasma proteomic research and clinical biomarker identification, 
identifying hundreds of differentially abundant proteins at biological 
concentrations as low as 47 ng/L in human plasma. Data are available via 
ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD047901. In summary, this study introduces 
a streamlined, cost-effective approach to deep plasma proteome analysis, 
expanding its utility beyond classical research environments and enabling 
larger-scale multiomics investigations in clinical settings. Our comparative 
analysis revealed that fractionation, whether the samples were pooled or 
separate postfractionation, significantly improved the number of proteins 
quantified. This underscores the value of fractionation in enhancing the depth 
of plasma proteome analysis, thereby offering a more comprehensive landscape for 
biomarker discovery in diseases such as COVID-19.

PURPOSE: Molecular markers, such as FOXO1 fusion genes and TP53 and MYOD1 
mutations, increasingly influence risk-stratified treatment selection for 
pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). This study aims to integrate molecular and 
clinical data to produce individualized prognosis predictions that can further 
improve treatment selection.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical variables and somatic mutation data for 20 genes 
from 641 RMS patients in the United Kingdom and the United States were used to 
develop three Cox proportional hazard models for predicting event-free survival 
(EFS). The 'Baseline Clinical' (BC) model included treatment location, age, 
fusion status, and risk group. The 'Gene Enhanced 2' (GE2) model added TP53 and 
MYOD1 mutations to the BC predictors. The 'Gene Enhanced 6' (GE6) model further 
included NF1, MET, CDKN2A, and MYCN mutations, selected through LASSO 
regression. Model performance was assessed using likelihood ratio (LR) tests and 
optimism-adjusted, bootstrapped validation and calibration metrics.
RESULTS: The GE6 model demonstrated superior predictive performance, offering 
39% more predictive information than the BC model (LR p<0.001) and 15% more than 
the GE2 model (LR p<0.001). The GE6 model achieved the highest discrimination 
with a C-index of 0.7087, a Nagalkerke R2 of 0.205, and appropriate calibration. 
Mutations in TP53, MYOD1, CDKN2A, MET, and MYCN were associated with higher 
hazards, while NF1 mutation correlated with lower hazard. Individual prognosis 
predictions varied between models in ways that may suggest different treatments 
for the same patient. For example, the 5-year EFS for a 10-year-old patient with 
high-risk, fusion-negative, NF1-positive disease was 50.0% (95% confidence 
interval: 39-64%) from BC but 76% (64-90%) from GE6.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating molecular markers into RMS prognosis models improves 
prognosis predictions. Individualized prognosis predictions may suggest 
alternative treatment regimens compared to traditional risk-classification 
schemas. Improved clinical variables and external validation are required prior 
to implementing these models into clinical practice.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of complex traits is essential for 
developing targeted interventions. We analyzed liver expression 
quantitative-trait locus (eQTL) meta-analysis data on 1,183 participants to 
identify conditionally distinct signals. We found 9,013 eQTL signals for 6,564 
genes; 23% of eGenes had two signals, and 6% had three or more signals. We then 
integrated the eQTL results with data from 29 cardiometabolic genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) traits and identified 1,582 GWAS-eQTL colocalizations 
for 747 eGenes. Non-primary eQTL signals accounted for 17% of all 
colocalizations. Isolating signals by conditional analysis prior to coloc 
resulted in 37% more colocalizations than using marginal eQTL and GWAS data, 
highlighting the importance of signal isolation. Isolating signals also led to 
stronger evidence of colocalization: among 343 eQTL-GWAS signal pairs in 
multi-signal regions, analyses that isolated the signals of interest resulted in 
higher posterior probability of colocalization for 41% of tests. Leveraging 
allelic heterogeneity, we predicted causal effects of gene expression on liver 
traits for four genes. To predict functional variants and regulatory elements, 
we colocalized eQTL with liver chromatin accessibility QTL (caQTL) and found 391 
colocalizations, including 73 with non-primary eQTL signals and 60 eQTL signals 
that colocalized with both a caQTL and a GWAS signal. Finally, we used publicly 
available massively parallel reporter assays in HepG2 to highlight 14 eQTL 
signals that include at least one expression-modulating variant. This 
multi-faceted approach to unraveling the genetic underpinnings of liver-related 
traits could lead to therapeutic development.

A major fraction of loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
mediate alternative splicing, but mechanistic interpretation is hindered by the 
technical limitations of short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which cannot 
directly link splicing events to full-length protein isoforms. Long-read RNA-seq 
represents a powerful tool to characterize transcript isoforms, and recently, 
infer protein isoform existence. Here, we present an approach that integrates 
information from GWASs, splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), and PacBio 
long-read RNA-seq in a disease-relevant model to infer the effects of sQTLs on 
the ultimate protein isoform products they encode. We demonstrate the utility of 
our approach using bone mineral density (BMD) GWAS data. We identified 1,863 
sQTLs from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project in 732 protein-coding 
genes that colocalized with BMD associations (H4PP ≥ 0.75). We generated PacBio 
Iso-Seq data (N = ∼22 million full-length reads) on human osteoblasts, 
identifying 68,326 protein-coding isoforms, of which 17,375 (25%) were 
unannotated. By casting the sQTLs onto protein isoforms, we connected 809 sQTLs 
to 2,029 protein isoforms from 441 genes expressed in osteoblasts. Overall, we 
found that 74 sQTLs influenced isoforms likely impacted by nonsense-mediated 
decay and 190 that potentially resulted in the expression of unannotated protein 
isoforms. Finally, we functionally validated colocalizing sQTLs in TPM2, in 
which siRNA-mediated knockdown in osteoblasts showed two TPM2 isoforms with 
opposing effects on mineralization but exhibited no effect upon knockdown of the 
entire gene. Our approach should be to generalize across diverse clinical traits 
and to provide insights into protein isoform activities modulated by GWAS loci.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer has brought serious threats to female health. 
CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) are key transcription factors involved 
in ovarian cancer. Therefore, comprehensive profiling C/EBPs in ovarian cancer 
is needed.
METHODS: A comprehensive analysis concerning C/EBPs in ovarian cancer was 
performed. Firstly, detailed expression of C/EBP family members was integrally 
retrieved and then confirmed using immunohistochemistry. The regulatory effects 
and transcription regulatory functions of C/EBPs were studied by using 
regulatory network analysis and enrichment analysis. Using survival analysis, 
receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and target-disease association 
analysis, the predictive prognostic value of C/EBPs on survival and drug 
responsiveness was systematically evaluated. The effects of C/EBPs on tumor 
immune infiltration were also assessed.
RESULTS: Ovarian cancer tissues expressed increased CEBPA, CEBPB, and CEBPG but 
decreased CEBPD when compared with normal control tissues. The overall 
alteration frequency of C/EBPs in ovarian cancer was approaching 30%. C/EBP 
family members formed a reciprocal regulatory network involving carcinogenesis 
and had pivotal transcription regulatory functions. C/EBPs could affect survival 
of ovarian cancer and correlated with poor survival outcomes (OS: HR = 1.40, 
P = .0053 and PFS: HR = 1.41, P = .0036). Besides, expression of CEBPA, CEBPB, 
CEBPD, and CEBPE could predict platinum and taxane responsiveness of ovarian 
cancer. C/EBPs also affected immune infiltration of ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: C/EBPs were closely involved in ovarian cancer and exerted multiple 
biological functions. C/EBPs could be exploited as prognostic and predictive 
biomarkers in ovarian cancer.

MOTIVATION: Integrating information from data sources representing different 
study designs has the potential to strengthen evidence in population health 
research. However, this concept of evidence "triangulation" presents a number of 
challenges for systematically identifying and integrating relevant information. 
These include the harmonization of heterogenous evidence with common semantic 
concepts and properties, as well as the priortization of the retrieved evidence 
for triangulation with the question of interest.
RESULTS: We present Annotated Semantic Queries (ASQ), a natural language query 
interface to the integrated biomedical entities and epidemiological evidence in 
EpiGraphDB, which enables users to extract "claims" from a piece of unstructured 
text, and then investigate the evidence that could either support, contradict 
the claims, or offer additional information to the query. This approach has the 
potential to support the rapid review of preprints, grant applications, 
conference abstracts, and articles submitted for peer review. ASQ implements 
strategies to harmonize biomedical entities in different taxonomies and evidence 
from different sources, to facilitate evidence triangulation and interpretation.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ASQ is openly available at

Many drug discovery projects are started but few progress fully through clinical 
trials to approval. Previous work has shown that human genetics support for the 
therapeutic hypothesis increases the chance of trial progression. Here, we 
applied natural language processing to classify the free-text reasons for 28,561 
clinical trials that stopped before their endpoints were met. We then evaluated 
these classes in light of the underlying evidence for the therapeutic hypothesis 
and target properties. We found that trials are more likely to stop because of a 
lack of efficacy in the absence of strong genetic evidence from human 
populations or genetically modified animal models. Furthermore, certain trials 
are more likely to stop for safety reasons if the drug target gene is highly 
constrained in human populations and if the gene is broadly expressed across 
tissues. These results support the growing use of human genetics to evaluate 
targets for drug discovery programs.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of Tu Fu Ling in 
treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) using network pharmacology and molecular 
docking.
METHODS: The TCMSP and Swiss target prediction databases were utilized to 
confirm the active components of Tu Fu Ling and their corresponding targets, 
with target gene names converted using the UniProt database. Genes related to AD 
were collected from DisGeNET, GeneCards, and the Open Target Platform databases. 
Common target genes between the disease and the drug were obtained using Venny 
2.1 tools and visualized using Cytoscape software. Protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) data were further analyzed to determine correlations between common target 
genes, and GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed for 
intersecting genes. Finally, PYmol, AutoDock Tool, Discovery Studio 2020, and 
PyRx software were used for preliminary computer virtual verification and 
visualization of active drug ingredients and target proteins.
RESULTS: Nine active ingredients meeting the screening criteria yielded a total 
of 168 genes after removing duplicates. A total of 3833 target genes were 
collected, with 129 overlapping target genes identified. GO enrichment analysis 
identified 643 biological processes, 82 cellular components, and 147 molecular 
functions. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis also revealed a pathway closely 
related to AD (hsa05010: Alzheimer's disease). In molecular docking analysis, 
the binding affinity between the 9 active ingredients and 10 core targets ranged 
from -3.5 to -12.3 kcal/mol, indicating strong binding.
CONCLUSION: This study preliminarily verified the combination of Tu Fu Ling's 
screened active ingredient and the calculated core target, suggesting a 
potential mechanism of action to improve the symptoms of AD patients through 
multi-target and multi-pathway approaches. This provides a valuable reference 
for further exploration of the pharmacological mechanism of AD and the 
formulation of drug therapy.

As a common cardiovascular disease (CVD), Arrhythmia refers to any abnormality 
in the origin, frequency, rhythm, conduction velocity, timing, pathway, 
sequence, or other aspect of cardiac impulses, and it is one of the common 
cardiovascular diseases in clinical practice. At present, various ion channel 
blockers are used for treatment of arrhythmia that include Na+ ion channel 
blockers, K+ ion channel blockers and Ca2+ ion channel blockers. While these 
drugs offer benefits, they have led to a gradual increase in drug-related 
adverse reactions across various systems. As a result, the quest for safe and 
effective antiarrhythmic drugs is pressing. Recent years have seen some 
advancements in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias using traditional 
Chinese medicine(TCM). The theory of Luobing in TCM has proposed a new drug 
intervention strategy of "fast and slow treatment, integrated regulation" 
leading to a shift in mindset from "antiarrhythmic" to "rhythm-regulating". 
Guided by this theory, the development of Shen Song Yang Xin Capsules (SSYX) has 
involved various Chinese medicinal ingredients that comprehensively regulate the 
myocardial electrophysiological mechanism, exerting antiarrhythmic effects on 
multiple ion channels and non-ion channels. Similarly, in clinical studies, 
evidence-based research has confirmed that SSYX combined with conventional 
antiarrhythmic drugs can more effectively reduce the occurrence of arrhythmias. 
Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive review of the composition and 
mechanisms of action, pharmacological components, network pharmacology analysis, 
and clinical applications of SSYX guided by the theory of Luobing, aiming to 
offer valuable insights for improved clinical management of arrhythmias and 
related research.

Introduction Acne vulgaris is a common skin problem caused by inflammation of 
the sebaceous glands and hair follicles as a result of hormonal fluctuations, 
bacteria, and overproduction of oil. The plant Peltophorum pterocarpum (P. 
pterocarpum) has been investigated for possible medical uses. Its 
anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant qualities are well recognised, 
and they may be applied to treat several diseases. This study investigates the 
plant's phytochemicals for their effectiveness in treating acne. Methods The 
Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry and Therapeutics (IMPPAT) database was 
utilised to extract the phytochemicals from P. pterocarpum. The absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) analysis was conducted using the 
online tool SwissADME. The SwissTargetPrediction tool determines the potential 
targets of these phytochemicals. Targets for acne have been identified using the 
Open Targets Platform database. The common targets of P. pterocarpum and acne 
were identified using the Venn diagram drawing tool Venny 2.1.0, and a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built using the Search Tool for 
the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. Following that, 
hub genes were identified by Cytoscape 3.10.2. The web tool ShinyGO 0.80 has 
enabled simpler evaluation of enrichment analysis for these hub genes. Results 
Five genes were shown to be key targets because they are directly engaged in the 
relaxin signalling pathway by pathway analysis: epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) and various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, and 
MMP13). The phytochemicals found in P. pterocarpum, including quercetin, 
rhamnetin, hirsutidin, and (+)-leucocyanidin, target these key genes. Conclusion 
This study highlights the potential of P. pterocarpum as a multi-target 
therapeutic agent for acne vulgaris. By targeting key genes in the relaxin 
signalling pathway, the phytochemicals from P. pterocarpum present a promising 
approach for acne management.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver cancer, with 
a high mortality rate due to the limited therapeutic options. Systemic drug 
treatments improve the patient's life expectancy by only a few months. 
Furthermore, the development of novel small molecule chemotherapeutics is 
time-consuming and costly. Drug repurposing has been a successful strategy for 
identifying and utilizing new therapeutic options for diseases with limited 
treatment options. This study aims to identify candidate drug molecules for HCC 
treatment through repurposing existing compounds, leveraging the machine 
learning tool MDeePred. The Open Targets Platform, UniProt, ChEMBL, and Expasy 
databases were used to create a dataset for drug target interaction (DTI) 
predictions by MDeePred. Enrichment analyses of DTIs were conducted, leading to 
the selection of 6 out of 380 DTIs identified by MDeePred for further analyses. 
The physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, water solubility, drug-likeness, 
and medicinal chemistry properties of the candidate compounds and approved drugs 
for advanced stage HCC (lenvatinib, regorafenib, and sorafenib) were analyzed in 
detail. Drug candidates exhibited drug-like properties and demonstrated 
significant target docking properties. Our findings indicated the binding 
efficacy of the selected drug compounds to their designated targets associated

exploited experimentally in HCC therapeutics. Our study also demonstrated the 
use of the MDeePred deep learning tool in in silico drug repurposing efforts for

Treatment response and resistance in major depressive disorder (MDD) show a 
significant genetic component, but previous studies had limited power also due 
to MDD heterogeneity. This literature review focuses on the genetic factors 
associated with treatment outcomes in MDD, exploring their overlap with those 
associated with clinically relevant symptom dimensions. We searched PubMed for: 
(1) genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or whole exome sequencing studies 
(WESs) that investigated efficacy outcomes in MDD; (2) studies examining the 
association between MDD treatment outcomes and specific depressive symptom 
dimensions; and (3) GWASs of the identified symptom dimensions. We identified 13 
GWASs and one WES of treatment outcomes in MDD, reporting several significant 
loci, genes, and gene sets involved in gene expression, immune system 
regulation, synaptic transmission and plasticity, neurogenesis and 
differentiation. Nine symptom dimensions were associated with poor treatment 
outcomes and studied by previous GWASs (anxiety, neuroticism, anhedonia, 
cognitive functioning, melancholia, suicide attempt, psychosis, sleep, 
sociability). Four genes were associated with both treatment outcomes and these 
symptom dimensions: CGREF1 (anxiety); MCHR1 (neuroticism); FTO and NRXN3 
(sleep). Other overlapping signals were found when considering genes 
suggestively associated with treatment outcomes. Genetic studies of treatment 
outcomes showed convergence at the level of biological processes, despite no 
replication at gene or variant level. The genetic signals overlapping with 
symptom dimensions of interest may point to shared biological mechanisms and 
potential targets for new treatments tailored to the individual patient's 
clinical profile.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is defined by the expansion of a lineage of 
genetically identical cells in blood. Genetic lesions that confer a fitness 
advantage, such as point mutations or mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) in 
genes associated with hematologic malignancy, are frequent mediators of CH. 
However, recent analyses of both single cell-derived colonies of hematopoietic 
cells and population sequencing cohorts have revealed CH frequently occurs in 
the absence of known driver genetic lesions. To characterize CH without known 
driver genetic lesions, we used 51,399 deeply sequenced whole genomes from the 
NHLBI TOPMed sequencing initiative to perform simultaneous germline and somatic 
mutation analyses among individuals without leukemogenic point mutations (LPM), 
which we term CH-LPMneg. We quantified CH by estimating the total mutation 
burden. Because estimating somatic mutation burden without a paired-tissue 
sample is challenging, we developed a novel statistical method, the Genomic and 
Epigenomic informed Mutation (GEM) rate, that uses external genomic and 
epigenomic data sources to distinguish artifactual signals from true somatic 
mutations. We performed a genome-wide association study of GEM to discover the 
germline determinants of CH-LPMneg. After fine-mapping and variant-to-gene 
analyses, we identified seven genes associated with CH-LPMneg (TCL1A, TERT, 
SMC4, NRIP1, PRDM16, MSRA, SCARB1), and one locus associated with a 
sex-associated mutation pathway (SRGAP2C). We performed a secondary analysis 
excluding individuals with mCAs, finding that the genetic architecture was 
largely unaffected by their inclusion. Functional analyses of SMC4 and NRIP1 
implicated altered HSC self-renewal and proliferation as the primary mediator of 
mutation burden in blood. We then performed comprehensive multi-tissue 
transcriptomic analyses, finding that the expression levels of 404 genes are 
associated with GEM. Finally, we performed phenotypic association meta-analyses 
across four cohorts, finding that GEM is associated with increased white blood 
cell count and increased risk for incident peripheral artery disease, but is not 
significantly associated with incident stroke or coronary disease events. 
Overall, we develop GEM for quantifying mutation burden from WGS without a 
paired-tissue sample and use GEM to discover the genetic, genomic, and 
phenotypic correlates of CH-LPMneg.

The druggable proteome refers to proteins that can bind to small molecules with 
appropriate chemical affinity, inducing a favorable clinical response. 
Predicting druggable proteins through screening and in silico modeling is 
imperative for drug design. To contribute to this field, we developed an 
accurate predictive classifier for druggable cancer-driving proteins using amino 
acid composition descriptors of protein sequences and 13 machine learning linear 
and non-linear classifiers. The optimal classifier was achieved with the support 
vector machine method, utilizing 200 tri-amino acid composition descriptors. The 
high performance of the model is evident from an area under the receiver 
operating characteristics (AUROC) of 0.975 ± 0.003 and an accuracy of 
0.929 ± 0.006 (threefold cross-validation). The machine learning prediction 
model was enhanced with multi-omics approaches, including the target-disease 
evidence score, the shortest pathways to cancer hallmarks, structure-based 
ligandability assessment, unfavorable prognostic protein analysis, and the 
oncogenic variome. Additionally, we performed a drug repurposing analysis to 
identify drugs with the highest affinity capable of targeting the best predicted 
proteins. As a result, we identified 79 key druggable cancer-driving proteins 
with the highest ligandability, and 23 of them demonstrated unfavorable 
prognostic significance across 16 TCGA PanCancer types: CDKN2A, BCL10, ACVR1, 
CASP8, JAG1, TSC1, NBN, PREX2, PPP2R1A, DNM2, VAV1, ASXL1, TPR, HRAS, BUB1B, 
ATG7, MARK3, SETD2, CCNE1, MUTYH, CDKN2C, RB1, and SMARCA4. Moreover, we 
prioritized 11 clinically relevant drugs targeting these proteins. This strategy 
effectively predicts and prioritizes biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and drugs 
for in-depth studies in clinical trials. Scripts are available at

The availability of data from profiling of cancer patients with multiomics is 
rapidly increasing. However, integrative analysis of such data for personalized 
target identification is not trivial. Multiomics2Targets is a platform that 
enables users to upload transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics data 
matrices collected from the same cohort of cancer patients. After uploading the 
data, Multiomics2Targets produces a report that resembles a research 
publication. The uploaded matrices are processed, analyzed, and visualized using 
the tools Enrichr, KEA3, ChEA3, Expression2Kinases, and TargetRanger to identify 
and prioritize proteins, genes, and transcripts as potential targets. 
Figures and tables, as well as descriptions of the methods and results, are 
automatically generated. Reports include an abstract, introduction, methods, 
results, discussion, conclusions, and references and are exportable as citable 
PDFs and Jupyter Notebooks. Multiomics2Targets is applied to analyze version 3 
of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC3) pan-cancer cohort, 
identifying potential targets for each CPTAC3 cancer subtype. Multiomics2Targets 
is available from https://multiomics2targets.maayanlab.cloud/.

Human disease-associated gene data are accessible through databases, including 
the Open Targets Platform, DisGeNET, miRTex, RNADisease, and PubChem. However, 
missing data entries in such databases are anticipated because of curational 
errors, biases, and text-mining failures. Additionally, the extensive research 
on human diseases has led to challenges in registering comprehensive data. The 
lack of essential data in databases hinders knowledge sharing and should be 
addressed. Therefore, we propose an analysis pipeline to explore missing entries 
of unexploited genes in the human disease-associated gene databases. Using this 
pipeline for genes in Parkinson's disease with oxidative stress revealed two 
unexploited genes: nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) and ubiquitin-like with PHD and 
ring finger domains 2 (UHRF2). This methodology enhances the identification of 
underrepresented disease-associated genes, facilitating easier access to 
potential human disease-related functional genes. This study aims to identify 
unexploited genes for further research and does not include independent 
experimental validation.

The rapid rise in the availability and scale of scRNA-seq data needs scalable 
methods for integrative analysis. Though many methods for data integration have 
been developed, few focus on understanding the heterogeneous effects of 
biological conditions across different cell populations in integrative analysis. 
Our proposed scalable approach, scParser, models the heterogeneous effects from 
biological conditions, which unveils the key mechanisms by which gene expression 
contributes to phenotypes. Notably, the extended scParser pinpoints biological 
processes in cell subpopulations that contribute to disease pathogenesis. 
scParser achieves favorable performance in cell clustering compared to 
state-of-the-art methods and has a broad and diverse applicability.

RATIONALE: Food allergy is a prevalent disease in the U.S., affecting nearly 30 
million people. The primary management strategy for this condition is food 
avoidance, as limited treatment options are available. The elevation of 
pathologic IgE and over-reactive mast cells/basophils is a central factor in 
food allergy anaphylaxis. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the 
potential therapeutic mechanisms of a small molecule compound called 
formononetin in regulating IgE and mast cell activation.
METHODS: In this study, we determined the inhibitory effect of formononetin on 
the production of human IgE from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 
food-allergic patients using ELISA. We also measured formononetin's effect on 
preventing mast cell degranulation in RBL-2H3 and KU812 cells using 
beta-hexosaminidase assay. To identify potential targets of formononetin in 
IgE-mediated diseases, mast cell disorders, and food allergies, we utilized 
computational modeling to analyze mechanistic targets of formononetin from 
various databases, including SEA, Swiss Target Prediction, PubChem, Gene Cards, 
and Mala Cards. We generated a KEGG pathway, Gene Ontology, and Compound Target 
Pathway Disease Network using these targets. Finally, we used qRT-PCR to measure 
the gene expression of selected targets in KU812 and U266 cell lines.
RESULTS: Formononetin significantly decreased IgE production in IgE-producing 
human myeloma cells and PBMCs from food-allergic patients in a dose-dependent 
manner without cytotoxicity. Formononetin decreased beta-hexosaminidase release 
in RBL-2H3 cells and KU812 cells. Formononetin regulates 25 targets in food 
allergy, 51 in IgE diseases, and 19 in mast cell diseases. KEGG pathway and gene 
ontology analysis of targets showed that formononetin regulated disease 
pathways, primary immunodeficiency, Epstein-Barr Virus, and pathways in cancer. 
The biological processes regulated by formononetin include B cell proliferation, 
differentiation, immune response, and activation processes. Compound target 
pathway disease network identified NFKB1, NFKBIA, STAT1, STAT3, CCND1, TP53, 
TYK2, and CASP8 as the top targets regulated at a high degree by formononetin. 
TP53, STAT3, PTPRC, IL2, and CD19 were identified as the proteins mostly 
targeted by formononetin. qPCR validated genes of Formononetin molecular targets 
of IgE regulation in U266 cells and KU812 cells. In U266 cells, formononetin was 
found to significantly increase the gene expression of NFKBIA, TP53, and BCL-2 
while decreasing the gene expression of BTK TYK, CASP8, STAT3, CCND1, STAT1, 
NFKB1, IL7R. In basophils KU812 cells, formononetin significantly increased the

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a prominent contributor to global morbidity and 
mortality. Its complex etiology involves genetics, epigenetics, and 
environmental factors. We review progress in understanding the genetics and 
epigenetics of AUD, summarizing the key findings. Advancements in technology 
over the decades have elevated research from early candidate gene studies to 
present-day genome-wide scans, unveiling numerous genetic and epigenetic risk 
factors for AUD. The latest GWAS on more than one million participants 
identified more than 100 genetic variants, and the largest epigenome-wide 
association studies (EWAS) in blood and brain samples have revealed 
tissue-specific epigenetic changes. Downstream analyses revealed enriched 
pathways, genetic correlations with other traits, transcriptome-wide association 
in brain tissues, and drug-gene interactions for AUD. We also discuss 
limitations and future directions, including increasing the power of GWAS and 
EWAS studies as well as expanding the diversity of populations included in these 
analyses. Larger samples, novel technologies, and analytic approaches are 
essential; these include whole-genome sequencing, multiomics, single-cell 
sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, deep-learning prediction of variant 
function, and integrated methods for disease risk prediction.

BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin (Ig) glycosylation modulates the immune response and 
plays a critical role in ageing and diseases. Studies have mainly focused on IgG 
glycosylation, and little is known about the genetics and epidemiology of IgA 
glycosylation.
METHODS: We generated, using a novel liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry method, the first large-scale IgA glycomics dataset in serum from 
2423 twins, encompassing 71 N- and O-glycan species.
RESULTS: We showed that, despite the lack of a direct genetic template, 
glycosylation is highly heritable, and that glycopeptide structures are 
sex-specific, and undergo substantial changes with ageing. We observe extensive 
correlations between the IgA and IgG glycomes, and, exploiting the twin design, 
show that they are predominantly influenced by shared genetic factors. A 
genome-wide association study identified eight loci associated with both the IgA 
and IgG glycomes (ST6GAL1, ELL2, B4GALT1, ABCF2, TMEM121, SLC38A10, SMARCB1, and 
MGAT3) and two novel loci specifically modulating IgA O-glycosylation (C1GALT1 
and ST3GAL1). Validation of our findings in an independent cohort of 320 
individuals from Qatar showed that the underlying genetic architecture is 
conserved across ancestries.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study delineates the genetic landscape of IgA glycosylation and 
provides novel potential functional links with the aetiology of complex immune 
diseases, including genetic factors involved in IgA nephropathy risk.

Gene misexpression is the aberrant transcription of a gene in a context where it 
is usually inactive. Despite its known pathological consequences in specific 
rare diseases, we have a limited understanding of its wider prevalence and 
mechanisms in humans. To address this, we analyzed gene misexpression in 4,568 
whole-blood bulk RNA sequencing samples from INTERVAL study blood donors. We 
found that while individual misexpression events occur rarely, in aggregate they 
were found in almost all samples and a third of inactive protein-coding genes. 
Using 2,821 paired whole-genome and RNA sequencing samples, we identified that 
misexpression events are enriched in cis for rare structural variants. We 
established putative mechanisms through which a subset of SVs lead to gene 
misexpression, including transcriptional readthrough, transcript fusions, and 
gene inversion. Overall, we develop misexpression as a type of transcriptomic 
outlier analysis and extend our understanding of the variety of mechanisms by 
which genetic variants can influence gene expression.

TWAS-GKF: a novel method for causal gene identification in transcriptome-wide 
association studies with knockoff inference.

MOTIVATION: Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) aims to identify 
trait-associated genes regulated by significant variants to explore the 
underlying biological mechanisms at a tissue-specific level. Despite the 
advancement of current TWAS methods to cover diverse traits, traditional 
approaches still face two main challenges: (i) the lack of methods that can 
guarantee finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control in identifying 
trait-associated genes; and (ii) the requirement for individual-level data, 
which is often inaccessible.
RESULTS: To address this challenge, we propose a powerful knockoff inference 
method termed TWAS-GKF to identify candidate trait-associated genes with a 
guaranteed finite-sample FDR control. TWAS-GKF introduces the main idea of 
Ghostknockoff inference to generate knockoff variables using only summary 
statistics instead of individual-level data. In extensive studies, we 
demonstrate that TWAS-GKF successfully controls the finite-sample FDR under a 
pre-specified FDR level across all settings. We further apply TWAS-GKF to 
identify genes in brain cerebellum tissue from the Genotype-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx) v8 project associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) from the Psychiatric 
Genomics Consortium (PGC), and genes in liver tissue related to low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from the UK Biobank, respectively. The results 
reveal that the majority of the identified genes are validated by Open Targets 
Validation Platform.

MOTIVATION: Disease gene prioritization methods assign scores to genes or 
proteins according to their likely relevance for a given disease based on a 
provided set of seed genes. This scoring can be used to find new biologically 
relevant genes or proteins for many diseases. Although methods based on 
classical random walks have proven to yield competitive results, quantum walk 
methods have not been explored to this end.
RESULTS: We propose a new algorithm for disease gene prioritization based on 
continuous-time quantum walks using the adjacency matrix of a protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network. We demonstrate the success of our proposed quantum 
walk method by comparing it to several well-known gene prioritization methods on 
three disease sets, across seven different PPI networks. In order to compare 
these methods, we use cross-validation and examine the mean reciprocal ranks of 
recall and average precision values. We further validate our method by 
performing an enrichment analysis of the predicted genes for coronary artery 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Individuals who have experienced a stroke, or transient ischemic 
attack, face a heightened risk of future cardiovascular events. Identification 
of genetic and molecular risk factors for subsequent cardiovascular outcomes may 
identify effective therapeutic targets to improve prognosis after an incident 
stroke.
METHODS: We performed genome-wide association studies for subsequent major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; ncases=51 929; ncontrols=39 980) and 
subsequent arterial ischemic stroke (AIS; ncases=45 120; ncontrols=46 789) after 
the first incident stroke within the Million Veteran Program and UK Biobank. We 
then used genetic variants associated with proteins (protein quantitative trait 
loci) to determine the effect of 1463 plasma protein abundances on subsequent 
MACE using Mendelian randomization.
RESULTS: Two variants were significantly associated with subsequent 
cardiovascular events: rs76472767 near gene RNF220 (odds ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 
0.64-0.85]; P=3.69×10-8) with subsequent AIS and rs13294166 near gene LINC01492 
(odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.37-1.67]; P=3.77×10-8) with subsequent MACE. Using 
Mendelian randomization, we identified 2 proteins with an effect on subsequent 
MACE after a stroke: CCL27 ([C-C motif chemokine 27], effect odds ratio, 0.77 
[95% CI, 0.66-0.88]; adjusted P=0.05) and TNFRSF14 ([tumor necrosis factor 
receptor superfamily member 14], effect odds ratio, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.24-1.60]; 
adjusted P=0.006). These proteins are not associated with incident AIS and are 
implicated to have a role in inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that 2 proteins with little effect on incident 
stroke appear to influence subsequent MACE after incident AIS. These 
associations suggest that inflammation is a contributing factor to subsequent 
MACE outcomes after incident AIS and highlights potential novel targets.

The categorization of human diseases is mainly based on the affected organ 
system and phenotypic characteristics. This is limiting the view to the 
pathological manifestations, while it neglects mechanistic relationships that 
are crucial to develop therapeutic strategies. This work aims to advance the 
understanding of diseases and their relatedness beyond traditional phenotypic 
views. Hence, the similarity among 502 diseases is mapped using six different 
data dimensions encompassing molecular, clinical, and pharmacological 
information retrieved from public sources. Multiple distance measures and 
multi-view clustering are used to assess the patterns of disease relatedness. 
The integration of all six dimensions into a consensus map of disease 
relationships reveals a divergent disease view from the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD), emphasizing novel insights offered by a 
multi-view disease map. Disease features such as genes, pathways, and chemicals 
that are enriched in distinct disease groups are identified. Finally, an 
evaluation of the top similar diseases of three candidate diseases common in the 
Western population shows concordance with known epidemiological associations and 
reveals rare features shared between Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's 
disease. A revision of disease relationships holds promise for facilitating the 
reconstruction of comorbidity patterns, repurposing drugs, and advancing drug 
discovery in the future.

Parkinson's disease is highly heterogeneous across disease symptoms, clinical 
manifestations and progression trajectories, hampering the identification of 
therapeutic targets. Despite knowledge gleaned from genetics analysis, 
dysregulated proteome mechanisms stemming from genetic aberrations remain 
underexplored. In this study, we develop a three-phase system-level 
proteogenomic analytical framework to characterize disease-associated proteins 
and dysregulated mechanisms. Proteogenomic analysis identified 577 proteins that 
enrich for Parkinson's disease-related pathways, such as cytokine receptor 
interactions and lysosomal function. Converging lines of evidence identified 
nine proteins, including LGALS3, CSNK2A1, SMPD3, STX4, APOA2, PAFAH1B3, LDLR, 
HSPB1, BRK1, with potential roles in disease pathogenesis. This study leverages 
the largest population-scale proteomics dataset, the UK Biobank Pharma 
Proteomics Project, to characterize genetically-driven protein disturbances 
associated with Parkinson's disease. Taken together, our work contributes to 
better understanding of genome-proteome dynamics in Parkinson's disease and sets 
a paradigm to identify potential indirect mediators connected to GWAS signals 
for complex neurodegenerative disorders.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by 
altered perception, mood, and behavior that profoundly impacts patients and 
society despite its relatively low prevalence. Sex-based differences have been 
described in schizophrenia epidemiology, symptomatology and outcomes. Different 
studies explored the impact of schizophrenia in the brain transcriptome, however 
we lack a consensus transcriptomic profile that considers sex and differentiates 
specific cerebral regions.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review on bulk RNA-sequencing studies of 
post-mortem brain samples. Then, we fulfilled differential expression analysis 
on each study and summarized their results with regions-specific meta-analyses 
(prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) and a global all-studies meta-analysis. 
Finally, we used the consensus transcriptomic profiles to functionally 
characterize the impact of schizophrenia in males and females by protein-protein 
interaction networks, enriched biological processes and dysregulated 
transcription factors.
RESULTS: We discovered the sex-based dysregulation of 265 genes in the 
prefrontal cortex, 1.414 genes in the hippocampus and 66 genes in the 
all-studies meta-analyses. The functional characterization of these gene sets 
unveiled increased processes related to immune response functions in the 
prefrontal cortex in male and the hippocampus in female schizophrenia patients 
and the overexpression of genes related to neurotransmission and synapses in the 
prefrontal cortex of female schizophrenia patients. Considering a meta-analysis 
of all brain regions available, we encountered the relative overexpression of 
genes related to synaptic plasticity and transmission in females and the 
overexpression of genes involved in organizing genetic information and protein 
folding in male schizophrenia patients. The protein-protein interaction networks 
and transcription factors activity analyses supported these sex-based profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results report multiple sex-based transcriptomic alterations in 
specific brain regions of schizophrenia patients, which provides new insight 
into the role of sex in schizophrenia. Moreover, we unveil a partial overlapping 
of inflammatory processes in the prefrontal cortex of males and the hippocampus 
of females.

Plain Language Summary: Schizophrenia is a serious illness characterised by 
changes in perception, mood and behaviour that profoundly affect patients and 
society. The frequency, symptoms and progression of schizophrenia are different 
in women and men, but the biological reason for this is not understood. The 
identification of disease mechanisms specific in men and women, is relevant 
because it would allow a better understanding of this pathology, as well as 
improving the personalisation of diagnoses and treatments for patients. To 
achieve this goal, in this work we reviewed all available RNA sequencing studies 
of post-mortem brain samples from women and men affected by schizophrenia. Then, 
we compared gene expression in each study by sex, and integrated all study 
results in different brain regions: prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and 
all-studies. We discovered significant changes between men and women: 265 genes 
differentially expressed in the prefrontal cortex, 1414 genes in the hippocampus 
and 66 genes in meta-analyses of all-studies. The study of these genes revealed 
increased immune response functions in the prefrontal cortex of men and in the 
hippocampus of women with schizophrenia, as well as increased neurotransmission 
and synapses in the prefrontal cortex of women with schizophrenia. Our results 
report multiple gene expression changes in specific brain regions of patients 
with schizophrenia, providing new insights into the role of sex in 
schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: Vitiligo is an auto-immune progressive depigmentation disorder of 
the skin due to loss of melanocytes. Genetic risk is one of the important 
factors for development of vitiligo. Preponderance of vitiligo in certain 
ethnicities is known which can be analysed by understanding the distribution of 
allele frequencies across normal populations. Earlier GWAS identified 108 risk 
alleles for vitiligo in Europeans and East Asians. In this study, 64 of these 
risk alleles were used for analysing their enrichment and depletion across 
populations (1000 Genomes Project and IndiGen) with reference to 1000 Genomes 
dataset. Genetic risk scores were calculated and Fisher's exact test was 
performed to understand statistical significance of their variation in each 
population with respect to 1000 Genomes dataset as reference. In addition to 
SNPs reported in GWAS, significant variation in allele frequencies of 1079 
vitiligo-related genes were also analysed. Two-tailed Chi-square test and 
Bonferroni's multiple adjustment values along with fixation index (≥ 0.5) and 
minimum allele frequency (≥ 0.05) were calculated and used to prioritise the 
variants based on pairwise comparison across populations.
RESULTS: Risk alleles rs1043101 and rs10768122 belong to 3 prime UTR of 
glutamate receptor gene SLC1A2 are found to be highly enriched in the South 
Asian population when compared with the 'global normal' population. Intron 
variant rs4766578 (ATXN2) was found to be deleted in SAS, EAS and AFR and 
enriched in EUR and AMR1. This risk allele is found to be under positive 
selection in SAS, AMR1 and EUR. From the ancillary vitiligo gene list, 
nonsynonymous variant rs16891982 was found to be enriched in the European and 
the Admixed American populations and depleted in all others. rs2279238 and 
rs11039155 belonging to the LXR-α gene involved in regulation of 
metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (melanocyte precursors) were found to be associated 
with vitiligo in the North Indian population (in earlier study).
CONCLUSION: The differential enrichment/depletion profile of the risk alleles 
provides insight into the underlying inter-population variations. This would 
provide clues towards prioritisation of SNPs associated with vitiligo thereby 
elucidating its preponderance in different ethnic groups.

There is a significant unmet need for clinical reflex tests that increase the 
specificity of prostate-specific antigen blood testing, the longstanding but 
imperfect tool for prostate cancer diagnosis. Towards this endpoint, we present 
the results from a discovery study that identifies new prostate-specific antigen 
reflex markers in a large-scale patient serum cohort using differentiating 
technologies for deep proteomic interrogation. We detect known prostate cancer 
blood markers as well as novel candidates. Through bioinformatic pathway 
enrichment and network analysis, we reveal associations of differentially 
abundant proteins with cytoskeletal, metabolic, and ribosomal activities, all of 
which have been previously associated with prostate cancer progression. 
Additionally, optimized machine learning classifier analysis reveals proteomic 
signatures capable of detecting the disease prior to biopsy, performing on par 
with an accepted clinical risk calculator benchmark.

Discerning the mechanisms driving type 2 diabetes (T2D) pathophysiology from 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remains a challenge. To this end, we 
integrated omics information from 16 multi-tissue and multi-ancestry expression, 
protein, and metabolite quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and 46 
multi-ancestry GWAS for T2D-related traits with the largest, most ancestrally 
diverse T2D GWAS to date. Of the 1,289 T2D GWAS index variants, 716 (56%) 
demonstrated strong evidence of colocalization with a molecular or T2D-related 
trait, implicating 657 cis-effector genes, 1,691 distal-effector genes, 731 
metabolites, and 43 T2D-related traits. We identified 773 of these cis- and 
distal-effector genes using either expression QTL data from understudied 
ancestry groups or inclusion of T2D index variants enriched in underrepresented 
populations, emphasizing the value of increasing population diversity in 
functional mapping. Linking these variants, genes, metabolites, and traits into 
a network, we elucidated mechanisms through which T2D-associated variation may 
impact disease risk. Finally, we showed that drugs targeting effector proteins 
were enriched in those approved to treat T2D, highlighting the potential of 
these results to prioritize drug targets for T2D. These results represent a leap 
in the molecular characterization of T2D-associated genetic variation and will 
aid in translating genetic findings into novel therapeutic strategies.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the most significant diseases that 
pose a threat to human health. The innovative traditional Chinese medicine 
Tongxinluo Capsule, developed under the guidance of the theory of traditional 
Chinese medicine, has good clinical efficacy in various cardiovascular diseases, 
this medicine has effects such as blood protection, vascular protection, 
myocardial protection, stabilizing vulnerable plaques, and vasodilation. 
However, CVDs are a multifactorial disease, and their underlying mechanisms are 
not fully understood. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of action and clinical 
application of Tongxinluo Capsule in the treatment of various cardiovascular 
diseases is beneficial for exerting its therapeutic effect from multiple 
components, targets, and pathways. At the same time, it provides broader 
treatment ideas for other difficult to treat diseases in the cardiovascular 
event chain, and has significant theoretical and clinical significance for 
improving the treatment of cardiovascular diseases with traditional Chinese 
medicine.

Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) facilitate the discovery of 
associations between a single genetic variant with multiple phenotypes. For 
variants which impact a specific protein, this can help identify additional 
therapeutic indications or on-target side effects of intervening on that 
protein. However, PheWAS is restricted by an inability to distinguish 
confounding due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) from true pleiotropy. Here we 
describe CoPheScan (Coloc adapted Phenome-wide Scan), a Bayesian approach that 
enables an intuitive and systematic exploration of causal associations while 
simultaneously addressing LD confounding. We demonstrate its performance through 
simulation, showing considerably better control of false positive rates than a 
conventional approach not accounting for LD. We used CoPheScan to perform PheWAS 
of protein-truncating variants and fine-mapped variants from disease and pQTL 
studies, in 2275 disease phenotypes from the UK Biobank. Our results identify 
the complexity of known pleiotropic genes such as APOE, and suggest a new causal 
role for TGM3 in skin cancer.

Explaining predictions for drug repositioning with biological knowledge graphs 
is a challenging problem. Graph completion methods using symbolic reasoning 
predict drug treatments and associated rules to generate evidence representing 
the therapeutic basis of the drug. Yet the vast amounts of generated paths that 
are biologically irrelevant or not mechanistically meaningful within the context 
of disease biology can limit utility. We use a reinforcement learning based 
knowledge graph completion model combined with an automatic filtering approach 
that produces the most relevant rules and biological paths explaining the 
predicted drug's therapeutic connection to the disease. In this work we validate 
the approach against preclinical experimental data for Fragile X syndrome 
demonstrating strong correlation between automatically extracted paths and 
experimentally derived transcriptional changes of selected genes and pathways of 
drug predictions Sulindac and Ibudilast. Additionally, we show it reduces the 
number of generated paths in two case studies, 85% for Cystic fibrosis and 95% 
for Parkinson's disease.

Proteins interact through their interfaces, and dysfunction of protein-protein 
interactions (PPIs) has been associated with various diseases. Therefore, 
investigating the properties of the drug-modulated PPIs and interface-targeting 
drugs is critical. Here, we present a curated large data set for drug-like 
molecules in protein interfaces. We further introduce DiPPI (Drugs in 
Protein-Protein Interfaces), a two-module web site to facilitate the search for 
such molecules and their properties by exploiting our data set in drug 
repurposing studies. In the interface module of the web site, we present several 
properties, of interfaces, such as amino acid properties, hotspots, evolutionary 
conservation of drug-binding amino acids, and post-translational modifications 
of these residues. On the drug-like molecule side, we list drug-like small 
molecules and FDA-approved drugs from various databases and highlight those that 
bind to the interfaces. We further clustered the drugs based on their molecular 
fingerprints to confine the search for an alternative drug to a smaller space. 
Drug properties, including Lipinski's rules and various molecular descriptors, 
are also calculated and made available on the web site to guide the selection of 
drug molecules. Our data set contains 534,203 interfaces for 98,632 protein 
structures, of which 55,135 are detected to bind to a drug-like molecule. 2214 
drug-like molecules are deposited on our web site, among which 335 are 
FDA-approved. DiPPI provides users with an easy-to-follow scheme for drug 
repurposing studies through its well-curated and clustered interface and drug 
data and is freely available at http://interactome.ku.edu.tr:8501.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Blood-based small molecule metabolites offer easy 
accessibility and hold significant potential for insights into health processes, 
the impact of lifestyle, and genetic variation on disease, enabling precise risk 
prevention. In a prospective study with records of heart failure (HF) incidence, 
we present metabolite profiling data from individuals without HF at baseline.
METHODS: We uncovered the interconnectivity of metabolites using data-driven and 
causal networks augmented with polygenic factors. Exploring the networks, we 
identified metabolite broadcasters, receivers, mediators, and subnetworks 
corresponding to functional classes of metabolites, and provided insights into 
the link between metabolomic architecture and regulation in health. We 
incorporated the network structure into the identification of metabolites 
associated with HF to control the effect of confounding metabolites.
RESULTS: We identified metabolites associated with higher and lower risk of HF 
incidence, such as glycine, ureidopropionic and glycocholic acids, and LPC 18:2. 
These associations were not confounded by the other metabolites due to 
uncovering the connectivity among metabolites and adjusting each association for 
the confounding metabolites. Examples of our findings include the direct 
influence of asparagine on glycine, both of which were inversely associated with 
HF. These two metabolites were influenced by polygenic factors and only 
essential amino acids, which are not synthesized in the human body and are 
obtained directly from the diet.
CONCLUSION: Metabolites may play a critical role in linking genetic background 
and lifestyle factors to HF incidence. Revealing the underlying connectivity of 
metabolites associated with HF strengthens the findings and facilitates studying 
complex conditions like HF.

Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer is common among postmenopausal 
women and is frequently treated with Letrozole, which inhibits aromatase from 
synthesizing estrogen from androgens. Decreased estrogen slows the growth of 
tumors and can be an effective treatment. The increase in Letrozole resistance 
poses a unique problem for patients. To better understand the underlying 
molecular mechanism(s) of Letrozole resistance, we reanalyzed transcriptomic 
data by comparing individuals who responded to Letrozole therapy (responders) to 
those who were resistant to treatment (non-responders). We identified SOX11 and 
S100A9 as two significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these 
patient cohorts, with "PLK1 signaling events" being the most significant 
signaling pathway. We also identified PRDX4 and E2F8 gene products as being the 
top mechanistic transcriptional markers for ER+ treatment resistance. Many of 
the significant DEGs that we identified play a known role in ER+ breast cancer 
or other types of cancer, which partially validate our results. Several of the 
gene products we identified are novel in the context of ER+ breast cancer. Many 
of the genes that we identified warrant further research to elucidate the more 
specific molecular mechanisms of Letrozole resistance in this patient population 
and could potentially be used as prognostic markers with further wet lab 
validation. We anticipate that these findings could contribute to improved 
detection and therapeutic outcomes in aromatase-resistant ER+ breast cancer 
patients.

BACKGROUND: The LuoBiTong (LBT) capsule, a novel traditional Chinese medicine 
formulation, is currently in Phase III clinical trials. Preliminary preclinical 
and Phase II clinical studies suggest its efficacy and safety in treating 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the underlying mechanisms of its action 
remain to be elucidated.This research aims to explore the effects and mechanisms 
of LBT in conjunction with a maintenance dose of methotrexate (M-MTX) on RA.
METHODS: A Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used to evaluate the 
anti-RA effects of LBT combined with M-MTX. Assessments included foot swelling, 
arthritis scoring, serum inflammatory factor analysis, and histopathological 
examination of the foot. These effects were compared with those of high-dose MTX 
(H-MTX). Network pharmacology was employed to construct a compound-target 
network for RA, based on drug composition, to predict its potential mechanism of 
action. Flow cytometry, Western Blot, and immunohistochemical analyses in animal 
models identified multiple inflammatory pathways targeted by LBT to augment the 
anti-RA effects of MTX.
RESULTS: The study revealed that LBT combined with M-MTX significantly 
alleviated CIA-induced arthritis without adverse effects. The combination of LBT 
and M-MTX showed similar or superior efficacy in regulating macrophage 
polarization, NF-κB, MAPK signaling pathways, and in the suppression of TH-17 
expression in proinflammatory cells. These findings suggest that LBT may exert a 
multi-pathway therapeutic effect in RA treatment. The predicted pharmacological 
targets and mechanisms align well with this hypothesis.
CONCLUSION: LBT, when combined with MTX, enhances the anti-RA effect by 
targeting multiple inflammatory pathways, demonstrating significant therapeutic 
potential.

The binding interactions between small molecules and proteins are the basis of 
cellular functions. Yet, experimental data available regarding compound-protein 
interaction is not harmonized into a single entity but rather scattered across 
multiple institutions, each maintaining databases with different formats. 
Extracting information from these multiple sources remains challenging due to 
data heterogeneity. Here, we present CPIExtract (Compound-Protein Interaction 
Extract), a tool to interactively extract experimental binding interaction data 
from multiple databases, perform filtering, and harmonize the resulting 
information, thus providing a gain of compound-protein interaction data. When 
compared to a single source, DrugBank, we show that it can collect more than 10 
times the amount of annotations. The end-user can apply custom filtering to the 
aggregated output data and save it in any generic tabular file suitable for 
further downstream tasks such as network medicine analyses for drug repurposing 
and cross-validation of deep learning models.

Genomic variation can impact normal biological function in complex ways and so 
understanding variant effects requires a broad range of data to be coherently 
assimilated. Whilst the volume of human variant data and relevant annotations 
has increased, the corresponding increase in the breadth of participating 
fields, standards and versioning mean that moving between genomic, coding, 
protein and structure positions is increasingly complex. In turn this makes 
investigating variants in diverse formats and assimilating annotations from 
different resources challenging. ProtVar addresses these issues to facilitate 
the contextualization and interpretation of human missense variation with 
unparalleled flexibility and ease of accessibility for use by the broadest range 
of researchers. By precalculating all possible variants in the human proteome it 
offers near instantaneous mapping between all relevant data types. It also 
combines data and analyses from a plethora of resources to bring together 
genomic, protein sequence and function annotations as well as structural 
insights and predictions to better understand the likely effect of missense 
variation in humans. It is offered as an intuitive web server 
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/protvar where data can be explored and downloaded, and can 
be accessed programmatically via an API.

BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) patients exhibit alterations in cerebral 
cortical structure and cognitive function. However, the mechanisms by which CHF 
affects cortical structure and functional regions remain unknown. This study 
aims to investigate potential causal relationship between CHF and cerebral 
cortical structure through Mendelian randomization (MR).
METHODS: The research utilized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to explore 
the causal association between CHF and cerebral cortical structure. The results 
were primarily analyzed using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW). The 
reliability of the data was verified through horizontal pleiotropy and 
heterogeneity analysis by MR-Egger intercept test and Cochran's Q-test, 
respectively. Replication analysis was conducted in the Integrative Epidemiology 
Unit (IEU) OpenGWAS project for further validation. In addition, we collected 
mediator genes that mediate causality to reveal potential mechanisms. Integrated 
bioinformatics analysis was conducted using the Open Target Genetics platform, 
the STRING database, and Cytoscape software.
RESULTS: The IVW results did not reveal any significant causal association 
between genetically predicted CHF and the overall structure of the cerebral 
cortex or the surface area (SA) of the 34 functional regions of the cerebral 
cortex (P > 0.05). However, the results revealed that CHF increased the 
thickness (TH) of pars opercularis (IVW: β = 0.015, 95% CI: 0.005-0.025, 
P = 3.16E-03). Replication analysis supported the causal association between CHF 
and pars opercularis TH (IVW: β = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.010-0.033, P = 1.84E-04). We 
examined the degree centrality values of the top 10 mediator genes, namely 
CDKN1A, CELSR2, NME5, SURF4, PSMA5, TSC1, RPL7A, SURF6, PRDX3, and FTO.
CONCLUSION: Genetic evidence indicates a positive correlation between CHF and 
pars opercularis TH.

Multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs) are compounds rationally designed to affect 
multiple targets, aiming for a better therapeutic profile. For over 20 years, 
MTDLs have garnered increasing attention, the idea being that their full 
potential would have been achieved, thanks to unprecedented target combinations 
and advanced medicinal chemistry strategies. This study presents a literature 
mining effort resulting in a data set of dual-target-directed ligands (DTDLs), 
the fundamental example of MTDLs. We used this data set to evaluate the 
rationale behind target selection and the chemical novelty of DTDLs targeting 
specific protein combinations. Our analysis focused on DTDL targets in terms of 
biological function, disease association, structure, and chemogenomic traits. We 
also compared DTDLs with single-target compounds. We found that well-known 
target pathology associations often guide DTDL design, leveraging existing 
chemical scaffolds and binding pocket similarities. These findings highlight the 
current state of the field and suggest substantial untapped potential for 
rational polypharmacology.

BACKGROUND: For Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), a long-term chronic illness, it is 
essential to identify and describe patient subtypes with comparable goal status 
and molecular biomarkers. This study aims to develop and validate a new 
subtyping scheme that integrates genome-scale transcriptomic profiles of RA 
peripheral blood genes, providing a fresh perspective for stratified treatments.
METHODS: We utilized independent microarray datasets of RA peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were subjected to functional enrichment analysis. Unsupervised cluster analysis 
was then employed to identify RA peripheral blood gene expression-driven 
subtypes. We defined three distinct clustering subtypes based on the identified 
404 up-regulated DEGs.
RESULTS: Subtype A, named NE-driving, was enriched in pathways related to 
neutrophil activation and responses to bacteria. Subtype B, termed 
interferon-driving (IFN-driving), exhibited abundant B cells and showed 
increased expression of transcripts involved in IFN signaling and defense 
responses to viruses. In Subtype C, an enrichment of CD8+ T-cells was found, 
ultimately defining it as CD8+ T-cells-driving. The RA subtyping scheme was 
validated using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. We also evaluated the 
therapeutic outcomes of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide valuable insights for deep stratification, 
enabling the design of molecular diagnosis and serving as a reference for 
stratified therapy in RA patients in the future.

Fine-mapping and gene-prioritisation techniques applied to the latest 
Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results have prioritised hundreds of genes 
as causally associated with disease. Here we leverage these recently compiled 
lists of high-confidence causal genes to interrogate where in the body disease 
genes operate. Specifically, we combine GWAS summary statistics, gene 
prioritisation results and gene expression RNA-seq data from 46 tissues and 204 
cell types in relation to 16 major diseases (including 8 cancers). In tissues 
and cell types with well-established relevance to the disease, the prioritised 
genes typically have higher absolute and relative (i.e. tissue/cell specific) 
expression compared to non-prioritised 'control' genes. Examples include brain 
tissues in psychiatric disorders (P-value < 1×10-7), microglia cells in 
Alzheimer's Disease (P-value = 9.8×10-3) and colon mucosa in colorectal cancer 
(P-value < 1×10-3). We also observe significantly higher expression for disease 
genes in multiple tissues and cell types with no established links to the 
corresponding disease. While some of these results may be explained by cell 
types that span multiple tissues, such as macrophages in brain, blood, lung and 
spleen in relation to Alzheimer's disease (P-values < 1×10-3), the cause for 
others is unclear and motivates further investigation that may provide novel 
insights into disease etiology. For example, mammary tissue in Type 2 Diabetes 
(P-value < 1×10-7); reproductive tissues such as breast, uterus, vagina, and 
prostate in Coronary Artery Disease (P-value < 1×10-4); and motor neurons in 
psychiatric disorders (P-value < 3×10-4). In the GTEx dataset, tissue type is 
the major predictor of gene expression but the contribution of each predictor 
(tissue, sample, subject, batch) varies widely among disease-associated genes. 
Finally, we highlight genes with the highest levels of gene expression in 
relevant tissues to guide functional follow-up studies. Our results could offer 
novel insights into the tissues and cells involved in disease initiation, inform 
drug target and delivery strategies, highlighting potential off-target effects, 
and exemplify the relative performance of different statistical tests for 
linking disease genes with tissue and cell type gene expression.

Genetic support for a drug target has been shown to increase the probability of 
success in drug development, with the potential to reduce attrition in the 
pharmaceutical industry alongside discovering novel therapeutic targets. It is 
therefore important to maximise the detection of genetic associations that 
affect disease susceptibility. Conventional statistical methods such as 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) only identify some of the genetic 
contribution to disease, so novel analytical approaches are required to extract 
additional insights. C4X Discovery has developed Taxonomy3, a unique method for 
analysing genetic datasets based on mathematics that is novel in drug discovery. 
When applied to a previously published rheumatoid arthritis GWAS dataset, 
Taxonomy3 identified many additional novel genetic signals associated with this 
autoimmune disease. Follow-up studies using tool compounds support the utility 
of the method in identifying novel biology and tractable drug targets with 
genetic support for further investigation.

Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease mediated by T-cell destruction of β 
cells in pancreatic islets. Currently, there is no known cure, and treatment 
consists of daily insulin injections. Genome-wide association studies and twin 
studies have indicated a strong genetic heritability for type I diabetes and 
implicated several genes. As most strongly associated variants are noncoding, 
there is still a lack of identification of functional and, therefore, likely 
causal variants. Given that many of these genetic variants reside in enhancer 
elements, we have tested 121 CD4+ T-cell enhancer variants associated with T1D. 
We found four to be functional through massively parallel reporter assays. Three 
of the enhancer variants weaken activity, while the fourth strengthens activity. 
We link these to their cognate genes using 3D genome architecture or eQTL data 
and validate them using CRISPR editing. Validated target genes include CLEC16A 
and SOCS1. While these genes have been previously implicated in type 1 diabetes 
and other autoimmune diseases, we show that enhancers controlling their 
expression harbor functional variants. These variants, therefore, may act as 
causal type 1 diabetic variants.

Exploring the relationships between genes and brain circuitry can be accelerated 
by joint analysis of heterogeneous datasets from 3D imaging data, anatomical 
data, as well as brain networks at varying scales, resolutions, and modalities. 
Generating an integrated view, beyond the individual resources' original 
purpose, requires the fusion of these data to a common space, and a 
visualization that bridges the gap across scales. However, despite ever 
expanding datasets, few platforms for integration and exploration of this 
heterogeneous data exist. To this end, we present the BrainTACO (Brain 
Transcriptomic And Connectivity Data) resource, a selection of heterogeneous, 
and multi-scale neurobiological data spatially mapped onto a common, 
hierarchical reference space, combined via a holistic data integration scheme. 
To access BrainTACO, we extended BrainTrawler, a web-based visual analytics 
framework for spatial neurobiological data, with comparative visualizations of 
multiple resources. This enables gene expression dissection of brain networks 
with, to the best of our knowledge, an unprecedented coverage and allows for the 
identification of potential genetic drivers of connectivity in both mice and 
humans that may contribute to the discovery of dysconnectivity phenotypes. 
Hence, BrainTACO reduces the need for time-consuming manual data aggregation 
often required for computational analyses in script-based toolboxes, and 
supports neuroscientists by directly leveraging the data instead of preparing 
it.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, 
with 1.9 million new cases in 2020 and a predicted rise to 3.2 million in 2040. 
Screening programmes are already in place to aid early detection and secondary 
prevention of CRC, but the rising prevalence means additional approaches are 
required in both primary and secondary prevention settings. Preventive therapy, 
whereby natural or synthetic agents are used to prevent, reverse or delay 
disease development, could be an effective strategy to further reduce cancer 
risk and potential agents have already been identified in conventional 
observational studies. However, as such studies are vulnerable to confounding 
and reverse causation, we aim to evaluate these observed relationships using 
Mendelian randomization (MR), an alternative causal inference approach which 
should be less susceptible to these biases.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use two-sample MR, which uses two independent 
samples for the exposure and outcome data, to investigate previously reported 
observational associations of multiple potential preventive agents with CRC 
risk. We define preventive agents as any synthetic (e.g. approved medication) or 
natural (e.g. micronutrient, endogenous hormone) molecule used to reduce the 
risk of cancer. We will first extract potential preventive agents that have been 
previously linked to CRC risk in observational studies from reviews of the 
literature. We will then evaluate whether we can develop a genetic instrument 
for each preventive agent from previously published genome-wide association 
studies (GWASs) of direct measures of molecular traits (e.g. circulating levels 
of protein drug targets, blood-based biomarkers of dietary vitamins). The 
summary statistics from these GWASs, and a large GWAS of CRC, will be used in 
two-sample MR analyses to investigate the causal effect of putative preventive 
therapy agents on CRC risk. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to evaluate 
the robustness of findings to potential violations of MR assumptions.

Plain Language Summary: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer 
worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. An 
individual’s chances of surviving the disease are increased if it is caught 
early or even prevented from developing in the first place. Currently, screening 
in the UK is offered to everyone over the age of 50 and whilst this can be 
effective in early cancer detection and secondary prevention, additional 
prevention strategies are needed to reduce cancer rates. Previous research has 
investigated whether intake of certain medications, dietary micronutrients or 
hormones can help prevent colorectal cancer development. There is some evidence 
to show that taking aspirin can reduce your risk of developing colorectal 
cancer, however, given potential adverse side effects to taking aspirin (e.g. 
gastrointestinal bleeding), this medication is not suitable for everyone. We 
wanted to assess whether other previously identified medications, micronutrients 
or hormones have any effect on reducing risk of cancer development. If we can 
identify a compound that could reduce an individual’s risk of developing 
colorectal cancer, it could be used as an additional cancer prevention strategy. 
We curated a list of potential preventive compounds from previously conducted 
studies that used observational epidemiological (i.e. non-randomised) methods. 
Distinguishing statistical correlations from causal relationships when using 
observational methods can be difficult. This can be due to additional factors in 
the study affecting both the use of potential preventive compounds and an 
individual’s risk of cancer development (e.g. those taking vitamin supplements 
having a healthier diet) or the observed relationship may be causal but in the 
opposite direction (e.g. a cancer diagnosis has a subsequent effect on dietary 
habits). We will use an alternative epidemiological method, called Mendelian 
randomization, which uses genetics to attempt to overcome this issue and enable 
us to determine if a specific compound is reducing cancer risk.

The fundamental goal of small molecule discovery is to generate chemicals with 
target functionality. While this often proceeds through structure-based methods, 
we set out to investigate the practicality of methods that leverage the 
extensive corpus of chemical literature. We hypothesize that a sufficiently 
large text-derived chemical function dataset would mirror the actual landscape 
of chemical functionality. Such a landscape would implicitly capture complex 
physical and biological interactions given that chemical function arises from 
both a molecule's structure and its interacting partners. To evaluate this 
hypothesis, we built a Chemical Function (CheF) dataset of patent-derived 
functional labels. This dataset, comprising 631 K molecule-function pairs, was 
created using an LLM- and embedding-based method to obtain 1.5 K unique 
functional labels for approximately 100 K randomly selected molecules from their 
corresponding 188 K unique patents. We carry out a series of analyses 
demonstrating that the CheF dataset contains a semantically coherent textual 
representation of the functional landscape congruent with chemical structural 
relationships, thus approximating the actual chemical function landscape. We 
then demonstrate through several examples that this text-based functional 
landscape can be leveraged to identify drugs with target functionality using a 
model able to predict functional profiles from structure alone. We believe that 
functional label-guided molecular discovery may serve as an alternative approach 
to traditional structure-based methods in the pursuit of designing novel 
functional molecules.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder whose prevalence increases with 
age. The disease manifests itself when the thyroid gland fails to produce 
sufficient thyroid hormones. The disorder includes cases of congenital 
hypothyroidism (CH), but most cases exhibit hormonal feedback dysregulation and 
destruction of the thyroid gland by autoantibodies. In this study, we sought to 
identify causal genes for hypothyroidism in large populations. The study used 
the UK-Biobank (UKB) database, reporting on 13,687 cases of European ancestry. 
We used GWAS compilation from Open Targets (OT) and tuned protocols focusing on 
genes and coding regions, along with complementary association methods of PWAS 
(proteome-based) and TWAS (transcriptome-based). Comparing summary statistics 
from numerous GWAS revealed a limited number of variants associated with thyroid 
development. The proteome-wide association study method identified 77 
statistically significant genes, half of which are located within the Chr6-MHC 
locus and are enriched with autoimmunity-related genes. While coding GWAS and 
PWAS highlighted the centrality of immune-related genes, OT and 
transcriptome-wide association study mostly identified genes involved in thyroid 
developmental programs. We used independent populations from Finland (FinnGen) 
and the Taiwan cohort to validate the PWAS results. The higher prevalence in 
females relative to males is substantiated as the polygenic risk score 
prediction of hypothyroidism relied mostly from the female group genetics. 
Comparing results from OT, TWAS, and PWAS revealed the complementary facets of 
hypothyroidism's etiology. This study underscores the significance of 
synthesizing gene-phenotype association methods for this common, intricate 
disease. We propose that the integration of established association methods 
enhances interpretability and clinical utility.

Poor prognosis and drug resistance in glioblastoma (GBM) can result from 
cellular heterogeneity and treatment-induced shifts in phenotypic states of 
tumor cells, including dedifferentiation into glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). 
This rare tumorigenic cell subpopulation resists temozolomide, undergoes 
proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) to evade therapy, and drives 
recurrence. Through inference of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) of 
patient-derived GSCs (PD-GSCs) at single-cell resolution, we demonstrate how the 
topology of transcription factor interaction networks drives distinct 
trajectories of cell-state transitions in PD-GSCs resistant or susceptible to 
cytotoxic drug treatment. By experimentally testing predictions based on TRN 
simulations, we show that drug treatment drives surviving PD-GSCs along a 
trajectory of intermediate states, exposing vulnerability to potentiated killing 
by siRNA or a second drug targeting treatment-induced transcriptional programs 
governing nongenetic cell plasticity. Our findings demonstrate an approach to 
uncover TRN topology and use it to rationally predict combinatorial treatments 
that disrupt acquired resistance in GBM.

PURPOSE: To assess the impact of ocular confounding factors on aqueous humor 
(AH) proteomic and metabolomic analyses for retinal disease characterization.
METHODS: This study recruited 138 subjects (eyes): 102 with neovascular 
age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), 18 with diabetic macular edema (DME), 
and 18 with cataract (control group). AH samples underwent analysis using Olink 
Target 96 proteomics and Metabolon's metabolomics platform Data analysis 
included correlation, differential abundance, and gene-set analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 756 proteins and 408 metabolites were quantified in AH. Total 
AH protein concentration was notably higher in nAMD (3.2-fold) and DME 
(4.1-fold) compared to controls. Pseudophakic eyes showed higher total AH 
protein concentrations than phakic eyes (e.g., 1.6-fold in nAMD) and a specific 
protein signature indicative of matrix remodeling. Unexpectedly, pupil-dilating 
drugs containing phenylephrine/tropicamide increased several AH proteins, 
notably interleukin-6 (5.4-fold in nAMD). Correcting for these factors revealed 
functionally relevant protein correlation clusters and disease-relevant, 
differentially abundant proteins across the groups. Metabolomics analysis, for 
which the relevance of confounder adjustment was less apparent, suggested 
insufficiently controlled diabetes and chronic hyperglycemia in the DME group.
CONCLUSIONS: AH protein concentration, pseudophakia, and pupil dilation with 
phenylephrine/tropicamide are important confounding factors for AH protein 
analyses. When these factors are considered, AH analyses can more clearly reveal 
disease-relevant factors.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Considering AH protein concentration, lens status, and 
phenylephrine/tropicamide administration as confounders is crucial for accurate 
interpretation of AH protein data.

It is established that there are sex differences in terms of prevalence, age of 
onset, clinical manifestations, and response to treatment for a variety of brain 
disorders, including neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative 
disorders. Cohorts of increasing sample sizes with diverse data types collected, 
including genetic, transcriptomic and/or phenotypic data, are providing the 
building blocks to permit analytical designs to test for sex-biased genetic 
variant-trait associations, and for sex-biased transcriptional regulation. Such 
molecular assessments can contribute to our understanding of the manifested 
phenotypic differences between the sexes for brain disorders, offering the 
future possibility of delivering personalized therapy for females and males. 
With the intention of raising the profile of this field as a research priority, 
this review aims to shed light on the importance of investigating sex-genetic 
interactions for brain disorders, focusing on two areas: (i) variant-trait 
associations and (ii) transcriptomics (i.e. gene expression, transcript usage 
and regulation). We specifically discuss recent advances in the field, current 
gaps and provide considerations for future studies.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Epilepsies are associated with differences in 
cortical thickness (TH) and surface area (SA). However, the mechanisms 
underlying these relationships remain elusive. We investigated the extent to 
which these phenotypes share genetic influences.
METHODS: We analyzed genome-wide association study data on common epilepsies (n 
= 69,995) and TH and SA (n = 32,877) using Gaussian mixture modeling MiXeR and 
conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) analysis to quantify their shared 
genetic architecture and identify overlapping loci. We biologically interrogated 
the loci using a variety of resources and validated in independent samples.
RESULTS: The epilepsies (2.4 k-2.9 k variants) were more polygenic than both SA 
(1.8 k variants) and TH (1.3 k variants). Despite absent genome-wide genetic 
correlations, there was a substantial genetic overlap between SA and genetic 
generalized epilepsy (GGE) (1.1 k), all epilepsies (1.1 k), and juvenile 
myoclonic epilepsy (JME) (0.7 k), as well as between TH and GGE (0.8 k), all 
epilepsies (0.7 k), and JME (0.8 k), estimated with MiXeR. Furthermore, conjFDR 
analysis identified 15 GGE loci jointly associated with SA and 15 with TH, 3 
loci shared between SA and childhood absence epilepsy, and 6 loci overlapping 
between SA and JME. 23 loci were novel for epilepsies and 11 for cortical 
morphology. We observed a high degree of sign concordance in the independent 
samples.
DISCUSSION: Our findings show extensive genetic overlap between generalized 
epilepsies and cortical morphology, indicating a complex genetic relationship 
with mixed-effect directions. The results suggest that shared genetic influences 
may contribute to cortical abnormalities in epilepsies.

Despite major advances in linking single genetic variants to single causal 
genes, the significance of genetic variation on transcript-level regulation of 
expression, transcript-specific functions, and relevance to human disease has 
been poorly investigated. Strawberry notch homolog 2 (SBNO2) is a candidate gene 
in a susceptibility locus with different variants associated with Crohn's 
disease and bone mineral density. The SBNO2 locus is also differentially 
methylated in Crohn's disease but the functional mechanisms are unknown. Here we 
show that the isoforms of SBNO2 are differentially regulated by 
lipopolysaccharide and IL-10. We identify Crohn's disease associated isoform 
quantitative trait loci that negatively regulate the expression of the 
noncanonical isoform 2 corresponding with the methylation signals at the isoform 
2 promoter in IBD and CD. The two isoforms of SBNO2 drive differential gene 
networks with isoform 2 dominantly impacting antimicrobial activity in 
macrophages. Our data highlight the role of isoform quantitative trait loci to 
understand disease susceptibility and resolve underlying mechanisms of disease.

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense promise for accelerating and 
improving all aspects of drug discovery, not least target discovery and 
validation. By integrating a diverse range of biological data modalities, AI 
enables the accurate prediction of drug target properties, ultimately 
illuminating biological mechanisms of disease and guiding drug discovery 
strategies. Despite the indisputable potential of AI in drug target discovery, 
there are many challenges and obstacles yet to be overcome, including dealing 
with data biases, model interpretability and generalisability, and the 
validation of predicted drug targets, to name a few. By exploring recent 
advancements in AI, this review showcases current applications of AI for drug 
target discovery and offers perspectives on the future of AI for the discovery 
and validation of drug targets, paving the way for the generation of novel and 
safer pharmaceuticals.

The molecular organization of the human neocortex historically has been studied 
in the context of its histological layers. However, emerging spatial 
transcriptomic technologies have enabled unbiased identification of 
transcriptionally defined spatial domains that move beyond classic 
cytoarchitecture. We used the Visium spatial gene expression platform to 
generate a data-driven molecular neuroanatomical atlas across the 
anterior-posterior axis of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Integration 
with paired single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data revealed distinct cell type 
compositions and cell-cell interactions across spatial domains. Using 
PsychENCODE and publicly available data, we mapped the enrichment of cell types 
and genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders to discrete spatial 
domains.

RepurposeDrugs (https://repurposedrugs.org/) is a comprehensive web-portal that 
combines a unique drug indication database with a machine learning (ML) 
predictor to discover new drug-indication associations for approved as well as 
investigational mono and combination therapies. The platform provides detailed 
information on treatment status, disease indications and clinical trials across 
25 indication categories, including neoplasms and cardiovascular conditions. The 
current version comprises 4314 compounds (approved, terminated or 
investigational) and 161 drug combinations linked to 1756 
indications/conditions, totaling 28 148 drug-disease pairs. By leveraging data 
on both approved and failed indications, RepurposeDrugs provides ML-based 
predictions for the approval potential of new drug-disease indications, both for 
mono- and combinatorial therapies, demonstrating high predictive accuracy in 
cross-validation. The validity of the ML predictor is validated through a number 
of real-world case studies, demonstrating its predictive power to accurately 
identify repurposing candidates with a high likelihood of future approval. To 
our knowledge, RepurposeDrugs web-portal is the first integrative database and 
ML-based predictor for interactive exploration and prediction of both 
single-drug and combination approval likelihood across indications. Given its 
broad coverage of indication areas and therapeutic options, we expect it 
accelerates many future drug repurposing projects.

INTRODUCTION: Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) is a 
childhood-onset autoimmune disease. Immune cells contribute to persistent 
inflammation observed in pJIA. Despite the crucial role of monocytes in 
arthritis, the precise involvement of classical monocytes in the pathogenesis of 
pJIA remains uncertain. Here, we aimed to uncover the transcriptomic patterns of 
classical monocytes in pJIA, focusing on their involvement in disease mechanism 
and heterogeneity.
METHODS: A total of 17 healthy subjects and 18 premenopausal women with pJIA 
according to ILAR criteria were included. Classical monocytes were isolated, 
and RNA sequencing was performed. Differential expression analysis was used to 
compare pJIA patients and healthy control group. Differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were identified, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was 
performed. Using unsupervised learning approach, patients were clustered in two 
groups based on their similarities at transcriptomic level. Subsequently, these 
clusters underwent a comparative analysis to reveal differences at the 
transcriptomic level.
RESULTS: We identified 440 DEGs in pJIA patients of which 360 were upregulated 
and 80 downregulated. GSEA highlighted TNF-α and IFN-γ response. Importantly, 
this analysis not only detected genes targeted by pJIA therapy but also 
identified new modulators of immuno-inflammation. PLAUR, IL1B, IL6, CDKN1A, 
PIM1, and ICAM1 were pointed as drivers of chronic hyperinflammation. 
Unsupervised learning approach revealed two clusters within pJIA, each 
exhibiting varying inflammation levels.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate the pivotal role of immuno-inflammation 
driven by classical monocytes in pJIA and reveals the existence of two 
subclusters within pJIA, regardless the positivity of rheumatoid factor and 
anti-CCP, paving the way to precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia genome-wide association studies (GWASes) have 
identified >250 significant loci and prioritized >100 disease-related genes. 
However, gene prioritization efforts have mostly been restricted to locus-based 
methods that ignore information from the rest of the genome.
METHODS: To more accurately characterize genes involved in schizophrenia 
etiology, we applied a combination of highly-predictive tools to a published 
GWAS of 67,390 schizophrenia cases and 94,015 controls. We combined both 
locus-based methods (fine-mapped coding variants, distance to GWAS signals) and 
genome-wide methods (PoPS, MAGMA, ultra-rare coding variant burden tests). To 
validate our findings, we compared them with previous prioritization efforts, 
known neurodevelopmental genes, and results from the PsyOPS tool.
RESULTS: We prioritized 62 schizophrenia genes, 41 of which were also 
highlighted by our validation methods. In addition to DRD2, the principal target 
of antipsychotics, we prioritized 9 genes that are targeted by approved or 
investigational drugs. These included drugs targeting glutamatergic receptors 
(GRIN2A and GRM3), calcium channels (CACNA1C and CACNB2), and GABAB receptor 
(GABBR2). These also included genes in loci that are shared with an addiction 
GWAS (e.g. PDE4B and VRK2).
CONCLUSIONS: We curated a high-quality list of 62 genes that likely play a role 
in the development of schizophrenia. Developing or repurposing drugs that target 
these genes may lead to a new generation of schizophrenia therapies. Rodent 
models of addiction more closely resemble the human disorder than rodent models 
of schizophrenia. As such, genes prioritized for both disorders could be 
explored in rodent addiction models, potentially facilitating drug development.

Astrocytes play a pivotal role in maintaining brain homeostasis. Recent research 
has highlighted the significance of palmitic acid (PA) in triggering 
pro-inflammatory pathways contributing to neurotoxicity. Furthermore, 
Genomic-scale metabolic models and control theory have revealed that metabolic 
switches (MSs) are metabolic pathway regulators by potentially exacerbating 
neurotoxicity, thereby offering promising therapeutic targets. Herein, we 
characterized these enzymatic MSs in silico as potential therapeutic targets, 
employing protein-protein and drug-protein interaction networks alongside 
structural characterization techniques. Our findings indicate that five MSs 
(P00558, P04406, Q08426, P09110, and O76062) were functionally linked to nervous 
system drug targets and may be indirectly regulated by specific neurological 
drugs, some of which exhibit polypharmacological potential (e.g., Trifluperidol, 
Trifluoperazine, Disulfiram, and Haloperidol). Furthermore, four MSs (P00558, 
P04406, Q08426, and P09110) feature ligand-binding or allosteric cavities with 
druggable potential. Our results advocate for a focused exploration of P00558 
(phosphoglycerate kinase 1), P04406 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), 
Q08426 (peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme, enoyl-CoA hydratase, and 3-hydroxyacyl 
CoA dehydrogenase), P09110 (peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase), and O76062 
(Delta(14)-sterol reductase) as promising targets for the development or 
repurposing of pharmacological compounds, which could have the potential to 
modulate lipotoxic-altered metabolic pathways, offering new avenues for the 
treatment of related human diseases such as neurological diseases.

The availability of protein measurements and whole exome sequence data in the UK 
Biobank enables investigation of potential observational and genetic 
protein-cancer risk associations. We investigated associations of 1463 plasma 
proteins with incidence of 19 cancers and 9 cancer subsites in UK Biobank 
participants (average 12 years follow-up). Emerging protein-cancer associations 
were further explored using two genetic approaches, cis-pQTL and exome-wide 
protein genetic scores (exGS). We identify 618 protein-cancer associations, of 
which 107 persist for cases diagnosed more than seven years after blood draw, 29 
of 618 were associated in genetic analyses, and four had support from long 
time-to-diagnosis ( > 7 years) and both cis-pQTL and exGS analyses: CD74 and 
TNFRSF1B with NHL, ADAM8 with leukemia, and SFTPA2 with lung cancer. We present 
multiple blood protein-cancer risk associations, including many detectable more 
than seven years before cancer diagnosis and that had concordant evidence from 
genetic analyses, suggesting a possible role in cancer development.

Glioma is a typical malignant tumor of the nervous system. It is of great 
significance to identify new biomarkers for accurate diagnosis of glioma. In 
this context, THOC6 has been studied as a highly diagnostic prognostic 
biomarker, which contributes to improve the dilemma in diagnosing gliomas. We 
used online databases and a variety of statistical methods, such as Wilcoxon 
rank sum test, Dunn test and t test. We analyzed the mutation, location and 
expression profile of THOC6, revealing the network of THOC6 interaction with 
disease. Wilcoxon rank sum test showed that THOC6 is highly expressed in gliomas 
(P < 0.001). Dunn test, Wilcoxon rank sum test and t test showed that THOC6 
expression was correlated with multiple clinical features. Logistic regression 
analysis further confirmed that THOC6 gene expression was a categorical 
dependent variable related to clinical features of poor prognosis. Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis showed that the overall survival (OS) of glioma patients with 
high expression of THOC6 was poor (P < 0.001). Both univariate (P < 0.001) and 
multivariate (P = 0.04) Cox analysis confirmed that THOC6 gene expression was an 
independent risk factor for OS in patients with glioma. ROC curve analysis 
showed that THOC6 had a high diagnostic value in glioma (AUC = 0.915). Based on 
this, we constructed a nomogram to predict patient survival. Enrichment analysis 
showed that THOC6 expression was associated with multiple signal pathways. 
Immuno-infiltration analysis showed that the expression of THOC6 in glioma was 
closely related to the infiltration level of multiple immune cells. Molecular 
docking results showed that THOC6 might be the target of anti-glioma drugs. 
THOC6 is a novel diagnostic factor and prognostic biomarker of glioma.

The ongoing expansion of human genomic datasets propels therapeutic target 
identification; however, extracting gene-disease associations from gene 
annotations remains challenging. Here, we introduce Mantis-ML 2.0, a framework 
integrating AstraZeneca's Biological Insights Knowledge Graph and numerous 
tabular datasets, to assess gene-disease probabilities throughout the phenome. 
We use graph neural networks, capturing the graph's holistic structure, and 
train them on hundreds of balanced datasets via a robust semi-supervised 
learning framework to provide gene-disease probabilities across the human exome. 
Mantis-ML 2.0 incorporates natural language processing to automate 
disease-relevant feature selection for thousands of diseases. The enhanced 
models demonstrate a 6.9% average classification power boost, achieving a median 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) score of 0.90 
across 5220 diseases from Human Phenotype Ontology, OpenTargets, and Genomics 
England. Notably, Mantis-ML 2.0 prioritizes associations from an independent UK 
Biobank phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), providing a stronger form of 
triaging and mitigating against underpowered PheWAS associations. Results are 
exposed through an interactive web resource.

Introduction: Gastric cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer 
worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO), the International Agency for 
Research on Cancer (IARC), and the Global Cancer Statistics (GLOBOCAN) reported 
an age standardized global incidence rate of 9.2 per 100,000 individuals for 
gastric cancer in 2022, with a mortality rate of 6.1. Despite considerable 
progress in precision oncology through the efforts of international consortia, 
understanding the genomic features and their influence on the effectiveness of 
anti-cancer treatments across diverse ethnic groups remains essential. Methods: 
Our study aimed to address this need by conducting integrated in silico analyses 
to identify actionable genomic alterations in gastric cancer driver genes, 
assess their impact using deleteriousness scores, and determine allele 
frequencies across nine global populations: European Finnish, European 
non-Finnish, Latino, East Asian, South Asian, African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi 
Jewish, and Amish. Furthermore, our goal was to prioritize targeted therapeutic 
strategies based on pharmacogenomics clinical guidelines, in silico drug 
prescriptions, and clinical trial data. Results: Our comprehensive analysis 
examined 275,634 variants within 60 gastric cancer driver genes from 730,947 
exome sequences and 76,215 whole-genome sequences from unrelated individuals, 
identifying 13,542 annotated and predicted oncogenic variants. We prioritized 
the most prevalent and deleterious oncogenic variants for subsequent 
pharmacogenomics testing. Additionally, we discovered actionable genomic 
alterations in the ARID1A, ATM, BCOR, ERBB2, ERBB3, CDKN2A, KIT, PIK3CA, PTEN, 
NTRK3, TP53, and CDKN2A genes that could enhance the efficacy of anti-cancer 
therapies, as suggested by in silico drug prescription analyses, reviews of 
current pharmacogenomics clinical guidelines, and evaluations of phase III and 
IV clinical trials targeting gastric cancer driver proteins. Discussion: These 
findings underline the urgency of consolidating efforts to devise effective 
prevention measures, invest in genomic profiling for underrepresented 
populations, and ensure the inclusion of ethnic minorities in future clinical 
trials and cancer research in developed countries.

We have developed the regional principal components (rPCs) method, a novel 
approach for summarizing gene-level methylation. rPCs address the challenge of 
deciphering complex epigenetic mechanisms in diseases like Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). In contrast to traditional averaging, rPCs leverage principal components 
analysis to capture complex methylation patterns across gene regions. Our method 
demonstrated a 54% improvement in sensitivity over averaging in simulations, 
offering a robust framework for identifying subtle epigenetic variations. 
Applying rPCs to the AD brain methylation data in ROSMAP, combined with cell 
type deconvolution, we uncovered 838 differentially methylated genes associated 
with neuritic plaque burden-significantly outperforming conventional methods. 
Integrating methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) with genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) identified 17 genes with potential causal roles in 
AD, including MS4A4A and PICALM. Our approach is available in the Bioconductor 
package regionalpcs, opening avenues for research and facilitating a deeper 
understanding of the epigenetic landscape in complex diseases.

Endurance exercise training is known to reduce risk for a range of complex 
diseases. However, the molecular basis of this effect has been challenging to 
study and largely restricted to analyses of either few or easily biopsied 
tissues. Extensive transcriptome data collected across 15 tissues during 
exercise training in rats as part of the Molecular Transducers of Physical 
Activity Consortium has provided a unique opportunity to clarify how exercise 
can affect tissue-specific gene expression and further suggest how exercise 
adaptation may impact complex disease-associated genes. To build this map, we 
integrate this multi-tissue atlas of gene expression changes with gene-disease 
targets, genetic regulation of expression, and trait relationship data in 
humans. Consensus from multiple approaches prioritizes specific tissues and 
genes where endurance exercise impacts disease-relevant gene expression. 
Specifically, we identify a total of 5523 trait-tissue-gene triplets to serve as 
a valuable starting point for future investigations [Exercise; Transcription; 
Human Phenotypic Variation].

The cost of drug discovery and development is driven primarily by failure1, with 
only about 10% of clinical programmes eventually receiving approval2-4. We 
previously estimated that human genetic evidence doubles the success rate from 
clinical development to approval5. In this study we leverage the growth in 
genetic evidence over the past decade to better understand the characteristics 
that distinguish clinical success and failure. We estimate the probability of 
success for drug mechanisms with genetic support is 2.6 times greater than those 
without. This relative success varies among therapy areas and development 
phases, and improves with increasing confidence in the causal gene, but is 
largely unaffected by genetic effect size, minor allele frequency or year of 
discovery. These results indicate we are far from reaching peak genetic insights 
to aid the discovery of targets for more effective drugs.

BACKGROUND: This study focused on circulating plasma protein profiles to 
identify mediators of hypertension-driven myocardial remodeling and heart 
failure.
METHODS: A Mendelian randomization design was used to investigate the causal 
impact of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and 
pulse pressure on 82 cardiac magnetic resonance traits and heart failure risk. 
Mediation analyses were also conducted to identify potential plasma proteins 
mediating these effects.
RESULTS: Genetically proxied higher SBP, DBP, and pulse pressure were causally 
associated with increased left ventricular myocardial mass and alterations in 
global myocardial wall thickness at end diastole. Elevated SBP and DBP were 
linked to increased regional myocardial radial strain of the left ventricle 
(basal anterior, mid, and apical walls), while higher SBP was associated with 
reduced circumferential strain in specific left ventricular segments (apical, 
mid-anteroseptal, mid-inferoseptal, and mid-inferolateral walls). Specific 
plasma proteins mediated the impact of blood pressure on cardiac remodeling, 
with FGF5 (fibroblast growth factor 5) contributing 2.96% (P=0.024) and 4.15% 
(P=0.046) to the total effect of SBP and DBP on myocardial wall thickness at end 
diastole in the apical anterior segment and leptin explaining 15.21% (P=0.042) 
and 23.24% (P=0.022) of the total effect of SBP and DBP on radial strain in the 
mid-anteroseptal segment. Additionally, FGF5 was the only mediator, explaining 
4.19% (P=0.013) and 4.54% (P=0.032) of the total effect of SBP and DBP on heart 
failure susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: This mediation Mendelian randomization study provides evidence 
supporting specific circulating plasma proteins as mediators of 
hypertension-driven cardiac remodeling and heart failure.

HiChIP enables cost-effective and high-resolution profiling of regulatory and 
structural loops. To leverage the increasing number of publicly available HiChIP 
datasets from diverse cell lines and primary cells, we developed the Loop 
Catalog (https://loopcatalog.lji.org), a web-based database featuring HiChIP 
loop calls for 1319 samples across 133 studies and 44 high-resolution Hi-C loop 
calls. We demonstrate its utility in interpreting fine-mapped GWAS variants 
(SNP-to-gene linking), in identifying enriched sequence motifs and motif pairs 
at loop anchors, and in network-level analysis of loops connecting regulatory 
elements (community detection). Our comprehensive catalog, spanning over 4M 
unique 5kb loops, along with the accompanying analysis modalities constitutes an 
important resource for studies in gene regulation and genome organization.

INTRODUCTION: Neutrophil predominant airway inflammation is associated with 
severe and steroid-resistant asthma clusters. Previously, we reported efficacy 
of ASHMI, a three-herb TCM asthma formula in a steroid-resistant 
neutrophil-dominant murine asthma model and further identified Ganoderic Acid C1 
(GAC1) as a key ASHMI active compound in vitro. The objective of this study is 
to investigate GAC1 effect on neutrophil-dominant, steroid-resistant asthma in a 
murine model.
METHODS: In this study, Balb/c mice were systematically sensitized with ragweed 
(RW) and alum and intranasally challenged with ragweed. Unsensitized/PBS 
challenged mice served as normal controls. Post sensitization, mice were given 4 
weeks of oral treatment with GAC1 or acute dexamethasone (Dex) treatment at 48 
hours prior to challenge. Pulmonary cytokines were measured by ELISA, and lung 
sections were processed for histology by H&E staining. Furthermore, GAC1 effect 
on MUC5AC expression and on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human 
lung epithelial cell line (NCI-H292) was determined by qRT-PCR and ROS assay 
kit, respectively. Computational analysis was applied to select potential 
targets of GAC1 in steroid-resistant neutrophil-dominant asthma. Molecular 
docking was performed to predict binding modes between GAC1 and Dex with TNF-α.
RESULTS: The result of the study showed that chronic GAC1 treatment, 
significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation (P < 0.01-0.001 vs Sham) and airway 
neutrophilia (P < 0.01 vs Sham), inhibited TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-5 levels (P < 
0.05-0.001 vs Sham). Acute Dex treatment reduced eosinophilic inflammation and 
IL-4, IL-5 levels, but had no effect on neutrophilia and TNF-α production. GAC1 
treated H292 cells showed decreased MUC5AC gene expression and production of ROS 
(P < 0.001 vs stimulated/untreated cells). Molecular docking results showed 
binding energy of complex GAC1-TNF was -10.8 kcal/mol.
DISCUSSION: GAC1 may be a promising anti-asthma botanical drug for treatment of 
steroid-resistant asthma.

The "missing" heritability of complex traits may be partly explained by genetic 
variants interacting with other genes or environments that are difficult to 
specify, observe, and detect. We propose a new kernel-based method called Latent 
Interaction Testing (LIT) to screen for genetic interactions that leverages 
pleiotropy from multiple related traits without requiring the interacting 
variable to be specified or observed. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that 
LIT increases power to detect latent genetic interactions compared to univariate 
methods. We then apply LIT to obesity-related traits in the UK Biobank and 
detect variants with interactive effects near known obesity-related genes (URL: 
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lit ).

Epigenetic modifications, characterized by changes in gene expression without 
altering the DNA sequence, play a crucial role in the development and 
progression of cancer by significantly influencing gene activity and cellular 
function. This insight has led to the development of a novel class of 
therapeutic agents, known as epigenetic drugs. These drugs, including histone 
deacetylase inhibitors, histone acetyltransferase inhibitors, histone 
methyltransferase inhibitors, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, aim to 
modulate gene expression to curb cancer growth by uniquely altering the 
epigenetic landscape of cancer cells. Ongoing research and clinical trials are 
rigorously evaluating the efficacy of these drugs, particularly their ability to 
improve therapeutic outcomes when used in combination with other treatments. 
Such combination therapies may more effectively target cancer and potentially 
overcome the challenge of drug resistance, a significant hurdle in cancer 
therapy. Additionally, the importance of nutrition, inflammation control, and 
circadian rhythm regulation in modulating drug responses has been increasingly 
recognized, highlighting their role as critical modifiers of the epigenetic 
landscape and thereby influencing the effectiveness of pharmacological 
interventions and patient outcomes. Epigenetic drugs represent a paradigm shift 
in cancer treatment, offering targeted therapies that promise a more precise 
approach to treating a wide spectrum of tumors, potentially with fewer side 
effects compared to traditional chemotherapy. This progress marks a step towards 
more personalized and precise interventions, leveraging the unique epigenetic 
profiles of individual tumors to optimize treatment strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the predominant dementia globally, 
with heterogeneous presentation and penetrance of clinical symptoms, variable 
presence of mixed pathologies, potential disease subtypes, and numerous 
associated endophenotypes. Beyond the difficulty of designing treatments that 
address the core pathological characteristics of the disease, therapeutic 
development is challenged by the uncertainty of which endophenotypic areas and 
specific targets implicated by those endophenotypes to prioritize for further 
translational research. However, publicly funded consortia driving large-scale 
open science efforts have produced multiple omic analyses that address both 
disease risk relevance and biological process involvement of genes across the 
genome.
METHODS: Here we report the development of an informatic pipeline that draws 
from genetic association studies, predicted variant impact, and linkage with 
dementia associated phenotypes to create a genetic risk score. This is paired 
with a multi-omic risk score utilizing extensive sets of both transcriptomic and 
proteomic studies to identify system-level changes in expression associated with 
AD. These two elements combined constitute our target risk score that ranks AD 
risk genome-wide. The ranked genes are organized into endophenotypic space 
through the development of 19 biological domains associated with AD in the 
described genetics and genomics studies and accompanying literature. The 
biological domains are constructed from exhaustive Gene Ontology (GO) term 
compilations, allowing automated assignment of genes into objectively defined 
disease-associated biology. This rank-and-organize approach, performed 
genome-wide, allows the characterization of aggregations of AD risk across 
biological domains.
RESULTS: The top AD-risk-associated biological domains are Synapse, Immune 
Response, Lipid Metabolism, Mitochondrial Metabolism, Structural Stabilization, 
and Proteostasis, with slightly lower levels of risk enrichment present within 
the other 13 biological domains.
DISCUSSION: This provides an objective methodology to localize risk within 
specific biological endophenotypes and drill down into the most significantly 
associated sets of GO terms and annotated genes for potential therapeutic 
targets.

Cross-disease genome-wide association studies (GWASs) unveil pleiotropic loci, 
mostly situated within the non-coding genome, each of which exerts pleiotropic 
effects across multiple diseases. However, the challenge "W-H-W" (namely, 
whether, how, and in which specific diseases pleiotropy can inform clinical 
therapeutics) calls for effective and integrative approaches and tools. We here 
introduce a pleiotropy-driven approach specifically designed for therapeutic 
target prioritization and evaluation from cross-disease GWAS summary data, with 
its validity demonstrated through applications to two systems of disorders 
(neuropsychiatric and inflammatory). We illustrate its improved performance in 
recovering clinical proof-of-concept therapeutic targets. Importantly, it 
identifies specific diseases where pleiotropy informs clinical therapeutics. 
Furthermore, we illustrate its versatility in accomplishing advanced tasks, 
including pathway crosstalk identification and downstream crosstalk-based 
analyses. To conclude, our integrated solution helps bridge the gap between 
pleiotropy studies and therapeutics discovery.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) plays a critical role in safeguarding cells 
against acetaldehyde toxicity and is closely linked to human metabolism. 
Nevertheless, the involvement of ALDH2 in cancer remains enigmatic. This 
investigation seeks to comprehensively assess ALDH2's significance in 
pan-cancer. We conducted an all-encompassing analysis of pan-cancer utilizing 
multiple databases, including TCGA, linkedomicshs, UALCAN, and Kaplan-Meier 
plotter. We employed diverse algorithms such as EPIC, MCPCOUNTER, TIDTIMER, 
xCell, MCP-counter, CIBERSORT, quanTIseq, and EPIC to examine the connection 
between ALDH2 expression and immune cell infiltration. Single-cell sequencing 
analysis furnished insights into ALDH2's functional status in pan-cancer. 
Immunohistochemical staining was performed to validate ALDH2 expression in 
cancer tissues. In a comprehensive assessment, we observed that tumor tissues 
demonstrated diminished ALDH2 expression levels compared to normal tissues 
across 16 different cancer types. ALDH2 expression exhibited a significant 
positive correlation with the infiltration of immune cells, including CD4 + T 
cells, CD8 + T cells, neutrophils, B cells, and macrophages, in various tumor 
types. Moreover, this study explored the association between ALDH2 and patient 
survival, examined the methylation patterns of ALDH2 in normal and primary tumor 
tissues, and delved into genetic variations and mutations of ALDH2 in tumors. 
The findings suggest that ALDH2 could serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker 
in pan-cancer, closely linked to the tumor's immune microenvironment.

Genetic factors play a fundamental role in disease development. Studying the 
genetic association with clinical outcomes is critical for understanding disease 
biology and devising novel treatment targets. However, the frequencies of 
genetic variations are often low, making it difficult to examine the variants 
one-by-one. Moreover, the clinical outcomes are complex, including patients' 
survival time and other binary or continuous outcomes such as recurrences and 
lymph node count, and how to effectively analyze genetic association with these 
outcomes remains unclear. In this article, we proposed a structured test 
statistic for testing genetic association with mixed types of survival, binary, 
and continuous outcomes. The structured testing incorporates known biological 
information of variants while allowing for their heterogeneous effects and is a 
powerful strategy for analyzing infrequent genetic factors. Simulation studies 
show that the proposed test statistic has correct type I error and is highly 
effective in detecting significant genetic variants. We applied our approach to 
a uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma study and identified several genetic 
pathways associated with the clinical outcomes.

Trace elements are important for human health but may exert toxic or adverse 
effects. Mechanisms of uptake, distribution, metabolism, and excretion are 
partly under genetic control but have not yet been extensively mapped. Here we 
report a comprehensive multi-element genome-wide association study of 57 
essential and non-essential trace elements. We perform genome-wide association 
meta-analyses of 14 trace elements in up to 6564 Scandinavian whole blood 
samples, and genome-wide association studies of 43 trace elements in up to 2819 
samples measured only in the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT). We identify 11 novel 
genetic loci associated with blood concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, 
manganese, selenium, and zinc in genome-wide association meta-analyses. In HUNT, 
several genome-wide significant loci are also indicated for other trace 
elements. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization, we find several indications 
of weak to moderate effects on health outcomes, the most precise being a weak 
harmful effect of increased zinc on prostate cancer. However, independent 
validation is needed. Our current understanding of trace element-associated 
genetic variants may help establish consequences of trace elements on human 
health.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are prevalent and anxiety symptoms co-occur with 
many psychiatric disorders. We aimed to identify genomic risk loci associated 
with anxiety, characterize its genetic architecture, and genetic overlap with 
psychiatric disorders.
METHODS: We used the GWAS of anxiety symptoms, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, 
major depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We 
employed MiXeR and LAVA to characterize the genetic architecture and genetic 
overlap between the phenotypes. Conditional and conjunctional false discovery 
rate analyses were performed to boost the identification of genomic loci 
associated with anxiety and those shared with psychiatric disorders. Gene 
annotation and gene set analyses were conducted using OpenTargets and FUMA, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Anxiety was polygenic with 12.9k estimated genetic risk variants and 
overlapped extensively with psychiatric disorders (4.1-11.4k variants). MiXeR 
and LAVA revealed predominantly positive genetic correlations between anxiety 
and psychiatric disorders. We identified 114 novel loci for anxiety by 
conditioning on the psychiatric disorders. We also identified loci shared 
between anxiety and major depression (n = 47), bipolar disorder (n = 33), 
schizophrenia (n = 71), and ADHD (n = 20). Genes annotated to anxiety loci 
exhibit enrichment for a broader range of biological pathways and differential 
tissue expression in more diverse tissues than those annotated to the shared 
loci.
CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety is a highly polygenic phenotype with extensive genetic 
overlap with psychiatric disorders. These genetic overlaps enabled the 
identification of novel loci for anxiety. The shared genetic architecture may 
underlie the extensive cross-disorder comorbidity of anxiety, and the identified 
genetic loci implicate molecular pathways that may lead to potential drug 
targets.

The relationship between schizophrenia (SCZ) and cancer development remains 
controversial. Based on the disease-gene association platform, it has been 
revealed that tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) could be an important 
mediatory factor in both cancer and SCZ development. TNF-α also increases the 
expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor 
kinase B (TrkB) in the development of SCZ and tumor, but the role of TNFR in 
mediating the association between the two diseases remains unclear. We studied 
the vital roles of TNFR2 in the progression of tumor and SCZ-like behavior using 
A549 lung cancer cell xenografted TNFR2 knockout mice. TNFR2 knockout mice 
showed significantly decreased tumor size and weight as well as 
schizophrenia-like behaviors compared to wild-type mice. Consistent with the 
reduced tumor growth and SCZ-like behaviors, the levels of TrkB and BDNF 
expression were significantly decreased in the lung tumor tissues and 
pre-frontal cortex of TNFR2 knockout mice. However, intravenous injection of 
BDNF (160 μg/kg) to TNFR2 knockout mice for 4 weeks increased tumor growth and 
SCZ-like behaviors as well as TrkB expression. In in vitro study, significantly 
decreased cell growth and expression of TrkB and BDNF by siTNFR2 transfection 
were found in A549 lung cancer cells. However, the addition of BDNF (100 ng/ml) 
into TNFR2 siRNA transfected A549 lung cancer cells recovered cell growth and 
the expression of TrkB. These results suggest that TNFR2 could be an important 
factor in mediating the comorbidity between lung tumor growth and SCZ 
development through increased TrkB-dependent BDNF levels.

At present, safe and effective treatment drugs are urgently needed for diabetic 
kidney disease (DKD). Circulating protein biomarkers with causal genetic 
evidence represent promising drug targets, which provides an opportunity to 
identify new therapeutic targets. Summary data from two protein quantitative 
trait loci studies are presented, one involving 4,907 plasma proteins data from 
35,559 individuals and the other encompassing 4,657 plasma proteins among 7,213 
European Americans. Summary statistics for DKD were obtained from a large 
genome-wide association study (3,345 cases and 2,372 controls) and the FinnGen 
study (3,676 cases and 283,456 controls). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis 
was conducted to examine the potential targets for DKD. The colocalization 
analysis was used to detect whether the potential proteins exist in the shared 
causal variants. To enhance the credibility of the results, external validation 
was conducted. Additionally, enrichment analysis, assessment of protein 
druggability, and the protein-protein interaction networks were used to further 
enrich the research findings. The proteome-wide MR analyses identified 21 blood 
proteins that may causally be associated with DKD. Colocalization analysis 
further supported a causal relationship between 12 proteins and DKD, with 
external validation confirming 4 of these proteins, and TGFBI was affirmed 
through two separate group data sets. These results indicate that targeting 
these four proteins could be a promising approach for treating DKD, and warrant 
further clinical investigations.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, immensely complex 
neurodegenerative disease by lack of effective treatments. To date, the 
challenge to establishing effective treatment for ALS remains formidable, partly 
due to inadequate translation of existing human genetic findings into actionable 
ALS-specific pathobiology for subsequent therapeutic development. This study 
evaluates the feasibility of network medicine methodology via integrating human 
brain-specific multi-omics data to prioritize drug targets and repurposable 
treatments for ALS. Using human brain-specific genome-wide quantitative trait 
loci (x-QTLs) under a network-based deep learning framework, we identified 105 
putative ALS-associated genes enriched in various known ALS pathobiological 
pathways, including regulation of T cell activation, monocyte differentiation, 
and lymphocyte proliferation. Specifically, we leveraged non-coding ALS loci 
effects from genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) on brain-specific expression 
quantitative trait loci (QTL) (eQTL), protein QTLs (pQTL), splicing QTL (sQTL), 
methylation QTL (meQTL), and histone acetylation QTL (haQTL). Applying network 
proximity analysis of predicted ALS-associated gene-coding targets and existing 
drug-target networks under the human protein-protein interactome (PPI) model, we 
identified a set of potential repurposable drugs (including Diazoxide, 
Gefitinib, Paliperidone, and Dimethyltryptamine) for ALS. Subsequent validation 
established preclinical and clinical evidence for top-prioritized repurposable 
drugs. In summary, we presented a network-based multi-omics framework to 
identify potential drug targets and repurposable treatments for ALS and other 
neurodegenerative disease if broadly applied.

Ageing is becoming an increasingly serious problem; therefore, there is an 
urgent need to find safe and effective anti-ageing drugs.
AIMS: To investigate the effects of Bazi Bushen capsule (BZBS) on the senescence 
of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and explore its mechanism of action.
METHODS: Network pharmacology was used to predict the targets of BZBS in 
delaying senescence in MSCs. For in vitro studies, MSCs were treated with D-gal, 
BZBS, and NMN, and cell viability, cell senescence, stemness-related genes, and 
cell cycle were studied using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, 
SA-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) and 
flow cytometry (FCM), respectively. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alizarin red, 
and oil red staining were used to determine the osteogenic and lipid 
differentiation abilities of MSCs. Finally, the expression of senescence-related 
genes and cyclin-related factors was detected by qPCR and western blotting.
RESULTS: Network pharmacological analysis suggested that BZBS delayed cell 
senescence by interfering in the cell cycle. Our in vitro studies suggested that 
BZBS could significantly increase cell viability (P < 0.01), decrease the 
quantity of β-galactosidase+ cells (P < 0.01), downregulate p16 and p21 
(P < 0.05, P < 0.01), improve adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, and 
upregulate Nanog, OCT4 and SOX2 genes (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in senescent MSCs. 
Moreover, BZBS significantly reduced the proportion of senescent MSCs in the 
G0/G1 phase (P < 0.01) and enhanced the expression of CDK4, Cyclin D1, and E2F1 
(P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). Upon treatment with HY-50767A, a CDK4 
inhibitor, the upregulation of E2F1 was no longer observed in the BZBS group.
CONCLUSIONS: BZBS can protect MSCs against D-gal-induced senescence, which may 
be associated with cell cycle regulation via the Cyclin D1/CDK4/E2F1 signalling 
pathway.

Immediate-early genes (IEGs) are a class of activity-regulated genes (ARGs) that 
are transiently and rapidly activated in the absence of de novo protein 
synthesis in response to neuronal activity. We explored the role of IEGs in 
genetic networks to pinpoint potential drug targets for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Using a combination of network analysis and genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) summary statistics we show that (1) IEGs exert greater topological 
influence across different human and mouse gene networks compared to other ARGs, 
(2) ARGs are sparsely involved in diseases and significantly more mutational 
constrained compared to non-ARGs, (3) Many AD-linked variants are in ARGs gene 
regions, mainly in MARK4 near FOSB, with an AD risk eQTL that increases MARK4 
expression in cortical areas, (4) MARK4 holds an influential place in a dense AD 
multi-omic network and a high AD druggability score. Our work on IEGs' 
influential network role is a valuable contribution to guiding interventions for 
diseases marked by dysregulation of their downstream targets and highlights 
MARK4 as a promising underexplored AD-target.

We have previously identified a network of higher-order brain regions 
particularly vulnerable to the ageing process, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's 
disease. However, it remains unknown what the genetic influences on this fragile 
brain network are, and whether it can be altered by the most common modifiable 
risk factors for dementia. Here, in ~40,000 UK Biobank participants, we first 
show significant genome-wide associations between this brain network and seven 
genetic clusters implicated in cardiovascular deaths, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's 
and Parkinson's disease, and with the two antigens of the XG blood group located 
in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes. We further reveal that the 
most deleterious modifiable risk factors for this vulnerable brain network are 
diabetes, nitrogen dioxide - a proxy for traffic-related air pollution - and 
alcohol intake frequency. The extent of these associations was uncovered by 
examining these modifiable risk factors in a single model to assess the unique 
contribution of each on the vulnerable brain network, above and beyond the 
dominating effects of age and sex. These results provide a comprehensive picture 
of the role played by genetic and modifiable risk factors on these fragile parts 
of the brain.

OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment is prevalent among individuals with epilepsy, 
and it is possible that genetic factors can underlie this relationship. Here, we 
investigated the potential shared genetic basis of common epilepsies and general 
cognitive ability (COG).
METHODS: We applied linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression, MiXeR and 
conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) to analyze different aspects of 
genetic overlap between COG and epilepsies. We used the largest available 
genome-wide association study data on COG (n = 269,867) and common epilepsies (n 
= 27,559 cases, 42,436 controls), including the broad phenotypes 'all epilepsy', 
focal epilepsies and genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE), and as well as 
specific subtypes. We functionally annotated the identified loci using a variety 
of biological resources and validated the results in independent samples.
RESULTS: Using MiXeR, COG (11.2k variants) was estimated to be almost four times 
more polygenic than 'all epilepsy', GGE, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and 
childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) (2.5k - 2.9k variants). The other epilepsy 
phenotypes were insufficiently powered for analysis. We show extensive genetic 
overlap between COG and epilepsies with significant negative genetic 
correlations (-0.23 to -0.04). COG was estimated to share 2.9k variants with 
both GGE and 'all epilepsy', and 2.3k variants with both JME and CAE. Using 
conjFDR, we identified 66 distinct loci shared between COG and epilepsies, 
including novel associations for GGE (27), 'all epilepsy' (5), JME (5) and CAE 
(5). The implicated genes were significantly expressed in multiple brain 
regions. The results were validated in independent samples (COG: p = 1.0 × 
10-14; 'all epilepsy': p = 5.6 × 10-3).
SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates a substantial genetic basis shared between 
epilepsies and COG and identifies novel overlapping genomic loci. Enhancing our 
understanding of the relationship between epilepsies and COG may lead to the 
development of novel comorbidity-targeted epilepsy treatments.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) may help inform treatments for 
infertility, whose causes remain unknown in many cases. Here we present GWAS 
meta-analyses across six cohorts for male and female infertility in up to 41,200 
cases and 687,005 controls. We identified 21 genetic risk loci for infertility 
(P≤5E-08), of which 12 have not been reported for any reproductive condition. We 
found positive genetic correlations between endometriosis and all-cause female 
infertility (rg=0.585, P=8.98E-14), and between polycystic ovary syndrome and 
anovulatory infertility (rg=0.403, P=2.16E-03). The evolutionary persistence of 
female infertility-risk alleles in EBAG9 may be explained by recent directional 
selection. We additionally identified up to 269 genetic loci associated with 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone, oestradiol, and 
testosterone through sex-specific GWAS meta-analyses (N=6,095-246,862). While 
hormone-associated variants near FSHB and ARL14EP colocalised with signals for 
anovulatory infertility, we found no rg between female infertility and 
reproductive hormones (P>0.05). Exome sequencing analyses in the UK Biobank 
(N=197,340) revealed that women carrying testosterone-lowering rare variants in 
GPC2 were at higher risk of infertility (OR=2.63, P=1.25E-03). Taken together, 
our results suggest that while individual genes associated with hormone 
regulation may be relevant for fertility, there is limited genetic evidence for 
correlation between reproductive hormones and infertility at the population 
level. We provide the first comprehensive view of the genetic architecture of 
infertility across multiple diagnostic criteria in men and women, and 
characterise its relationship to other health conditions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests as a complex systems pathology with intricate 
interplay among various genes and biological processes. Traditional differential 
gene expression (DEG) analysis, while commonly employed to characterize 
AD-driven perturbations, does not sufficiently capture the full spectrum of 
underlying biological processes. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data 
from postmortem brain samples across key regions-middle temporal gyrus, superior 
frontal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex-we provide a comprehensive systematic 
analysis of disrupted processes in AD. We go beyond the DEG-centric analysis by 
integrating pathway activity analysis with weighted gene co-expression patterns 
to comprehensively map gene interconnectivity, identifying region- and 
cell-type-specific drivers of biological processes associated with AD. Our 
analysis reveals profound modular heterogeneity in neurons and glia as well as 
extensive AD-related functional disruptions. Co-expression networks highlighted 
the extended involvement of astrocytes and microglia in biological processes 
beyond neuroinflammation, such as calcium homeostasis, glutamate regulation, 
lipid metabolism, vesicle-mediated transport, and TOR signaling. We find limited 
representation of DEGs within dysregulated pathways across neurons and glial 
cells, indicating that differential gene expression alone may not adequately 
represent the disease complexity. Further dissection of inferred gene modules 
revealed distinct dynamics of hub DEGs in neurons versus glia, highlighting the 
differential impact of DEGs on neurons compared to glial cells in driving 
modular dysregulations underlying perturbed biological processes. Interestingly, 
we note an overall downregulation of both astrocyte and microglia modules in AD 
across all brain regions, suggesting a prevailing trend of functional repression 
in glial cells across these regions. Notable genes, including those of the CALM 
and HSP90 family genes emerged as hub genes across neuronal modules in all brain 
regions, indicating conserved roles as drivers of synaptic dysfunction in AD. 
Our findings demonstrate the importance of an integrated, systems-oriented 
approach combining pathway and network analysis for a comprehensive 
understanding of the cell-type-specific roles of genes in AD-related biological 
processes.

This study aimed to determine the diagnostic yield of singleton exome sequencing 
and subsequent research-based trio exome analysis in children with a spectrum of 
brain malformations seen commonly in clinical practice. We recruited children ≤ 
18 years old with a brain malformation diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging 
and consistent with an established list of known genetic causes. Patients were 
ascertained nationally from eight tertiary paediatric centres as part of the 
Australian Genomics Brain Malformation Flagship. Chromosome microarray was 
required for all children, and those with pathogenic copy number changes were 
excluded. Cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction on neonatal blood spots was 
performed on all children with polymicrogyria with positive patients excluded. 
Singleton exome sequencing was performed through a diagnostic laboratory and 
analysed using a clinical exome sequencing pipeline. Undiagnosed patients were 
followed up in a research setting, including reanalysis of the singleton exome 
data and subsequent trio exome sequencing. A total of 102 children were 
recruited. Ten malformation subtypes were identified with the commonest being 
polymicrogyria (36%), pontocerebellar hypoplasia (14%), periventricular nodular 
heterotopia (11%), tubulinopathy (10%), lissencephaly (10%) and cortical 
dysplasia (9%). The overall diagnostic yield for the clinical singleton exome 
sequencing was 36%, which increased to 43% after research follow-up. The main 
source of increased diagnostic yield was the reanalysis of the singleton exome 
data to include newly discovered gene-disease associations. One additional 
diagnosis was made by trio exome sequencing. The highest phenotype-based 
diagnostic yields were for cobblestone malformation, tubulinopathy and 
lissencephaly and the lowest for cortical dysplasia and polymicrogyria. 
Pathogenic variants were identified in 32 genes, with variants in 6/32 genes 
occurring in more than one patient. The most frequent genetic diagnosis was 
pathogenic variants in TUBA1A. This study shows that over 40% of patients with 
common brain malformations have a genetic aetiology identified by exome 
sequencing. Periodic reanalysis of exome data to include newly identified genes 
was of greater value in increasing diagnostic yield than the expansion to trio 
exome. This study highlights the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of brain 
malformations, the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and 
the large number of patients that remain without a genetic diagnosis despite 
clinical exome sequencing and research reanalysis.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common solid renal tumor. 
Therefore, it is necessary to explore the related tumor markers. LGALS3BP 
(galectin 3 binding protein) is a multifunctional glycoprotein implicated in 
immunity and cancer. Some studies have shown that LGALS3BP promotes the 
occurrence and development of tumors. However, their exact role in renal 
tumorigenesis remains unclear. Our study used a webserver to explore the mRNA 
expression and clinical features of LGALS3BP in ccRCC. Survival analysis showed 
that patients with high LGALS3BP expression had significantly worse OS and DFS 
than those with low LGALS3BP expression. LGALS3BP expression is significantly 
related to B cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. 
Furthermore, we determined that LGALS3BP is significantly associated with 
angiogenesis, stemness and proliferation in renal cancer. Three phenotypes may 
be associated with a poor prognosis. Genes related to proliferation, 
angiogenesis and stemness were derived from a Venn diagram of FGF2. FGF2 is 
negatively correlated with proliferation and positively correlated with 
angiogenesis. Finally, we screened for drugs that may have potential therapeutic 
value for ccRCC. The PCR results showed that the expression of LGALS3BP in the 
normal cell line was lower than that in the tumor cell lines. After LGALS3BP 
knockdown, the proliferation of 769-P and 786-O cells decreased. The present 
findings show that LGALS3BP is critical for ccRCC cell proliferation and may be 
a potential target and biomarker for ccRCC.

Multimorbidity represents an increasingly important public health challenge with 
far-reaching implications for health management and policy. Mental health and 
metabolic diseases have a well-established epidemiological association. In this 
study, we investigate the genetic intersection between type 2 diabetes and 
schizophrenia. We use Mendelian randomization to examine potential causal 
relationships between the two conditions and related endophenotypes. We report 
no compelling evidence that type 2 diabetes genetic liability potentially 
causally influences schizophrenia risk and vice versa. Our findings show that 
increased body mass index (BMI) has a protective effect against schizophrenia, 
in contrast to the well-known risk-increasing effect of BMI on type 2 diabetes 
risk. We identify evidence of colocalization of association signals for these 
two conditions at 11 genomic loci, six of which have opposing directions of 
effect for type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia. To elucidate these colocalizing 
signals, we integrate multi-omics data from bulk and single-cell gene expression 
studies, along with functional information. We identify putative effector genes 
and find that they are enriched for homeostasis and lipid-related pathways. We 
also highlight drug repurposing opportunities including N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptor antagonists. Our findings provide insights into shared 
biological mechanisms for type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia, highlighting common 
factors that influence the risk of the two conditions in opposite directions and 
shedding light on the complex nature of this comorbidity.

The prevalence of heart failure (HF) subtypes, which are classified by left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), demonstrate significant sex differences. 
Here, we perform sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on LVEF 
and transcriptome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) on LVEF, all-cause HF, HF 
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF). The sex-stratified GWASs of LVEF identified three sex-specific loci 
that were exclusively detected in the sex-stratified GWASs. Three drug target 
genes show sex-differential effects on HF/HFrEF via influencing LVEF, with NPR2 
as the target gene for the HF drug Cenderitide under phase 2 clinical trial. Our 
study highlights the importance of considering sex-differential genetic effects 
in sex-balanced diseases such as HF and emphasizes the value of sex-stratified 
GWASs and MR in identifying putative genetic variants, causal genes, and 
candidate drug targets for HF, which is not identifiable using a sex-combined 
strategy.

INTRODUCTION: Hyperuricemia (HUA) is a metabolic disorder caused by purine 
metabolism dysfunction in which the increasing purine levels can be partially 
attributed to seafood consumption. Perillae Folium (PF), a widely used plant in 
functional food, has been historically used to mitigate seafood-induced 
diseases. However, its efficacy against HUA and the underlying mechanism remain 
unclear.
METHODS: A network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify candidate 
targets and potential mechanisms involved in PF treating HUA. The candidate 
targets were determined based on TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction, Open Targets 
Platform, GeneCards, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, and DrugBank. The 
potential mechanisms were predicted via Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Gene and 
Genome Encyclopedia (KEGG) analyses. Molecular docking in AutoDock Vina and PyRx 
were performed to predict the binding affinity and pose between herbal compounds 
and HUA-related targets. A chemical structure analysis of PF compounds was 
performed using OSIRIS DataWarrior and ClassyFire. We then conducted virtual 
pharmacokinetic and toxicity screening to filter potential inhibitors. We 
further performed verifications of these inhibitors' roles in HUA through 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, text-mining, and untargeted metabolomics 
analysis.
RESULTS: We obtained 8200 predicted binding results between 328 herbal compounds 
and 25 potential targets, and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) exhibited the highest 
average binding affinity. We screened out five promising ligands (scutellarein, 
benzyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside, elemol, diisobutyl phthalate, and 
(3R)-hydroxy-beta-ionone) and performed MD simulations up to 50 ns for XDH 
complexed to them. The scutellarein-XDH complex exhibited the most satisfactory 
stability. Furthermore, the text-mining study provided laboratory evidence of 
scutellarein's function. The metabolomics approach identified 543 compounds and 
confirmed the presence of scutellarein. Extending MD simulations to 200 ns 
further indicated the sustained impact of scutellarein on XDH structure.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides a computational and biomedical basis for PF 
treating HUA and fully elucidates scutellarein's great potential as an XDH 
inhibitor at the molecular level, holding promise for future drug design and 
development.

Skin color is highly variable in Africans, yet little is known about the 
underlying molecular mechanism. Here we applied massively parallel reporter 
assays to screen 1,157 candidate variants influencing skin pigmentation in 
Africans and identified 165 single-nucleotide polymorphisms showing differential 
regulatory activities between alleles. We combine Hi-C, genome editing and 
melanin assays to identify regulatory elements for MFSD12, HMG20B, OCA2, MITF, 
LEF1, TRPS1, BLOC1S6 and CYB561A3 that impact melanin levels in vitro and 
modulate human skin color. We found that independent mutations in an OCA2 
enhancer contribute to the evolution of human skin color diversity and detect 
signals of local adaptation at enhancers of MITF, LEF1 and TRPS1, which may 
contribute to the light skin color of Khoesan-speaking populations from Southern 
Africa. Additionally, we identified CYB561A3 as a novel pigmentation regulator 
that impacts genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and melanogenesis. 
These results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying human skin color 
diversity and adaptive evolution.

Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) is a secreted glycoprotein that mediates 
inflammation, macrophage polarization, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. The 
expression of CHI3L1 is strongly upregulated by various inflammatory and 
immunological diseases, including several cancers, Alzheimer's disease, and 
atherosclerosis. Several studies have shown that CHI3L1 can be considered as a 
marker of disease diagnosis, prognosis, disease activity, and severity. In 
addition, the proinflammatory action of CHI3L1 may be mediated via responses to 
various proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, 
interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interferon-γ. Therefore, CHI3L1 may 
contribute to a vast array of inflammatory diseases. However, its 
pathophysiological and pharmacological roles in the development of inflammatory 
diseases remain unclear. In this article, we review recent findings regarding 
the roles of CHI3L1 in the development of inflammatory diseases and suggest 
therapeutic approaches that target CHI3L1.

Thousands of proteins have been validated genetically as therapeutic targets for 
human diseases1. However, very few have been successfully targeted, and many are 
considered 'undruggable'. This is particularly true for proteins that function 
via protein-protein interactions-direct inhibition of binding interfaces is 
difficult and requires the identification of allosteric sites. However, most 
proteins have no known allosteric sites, and a comprehensive allosteric map does 
not exist for any protein. Here we address this shortcoming by charting multiple 
global atlases of inhibitory allosteric communication in KRAS. We quantified the 
effects of more than 26,000 mutations on the folding of KRAS and its binding to 
six interaction partners. Genetic interactions in double mutants enabled us to 
perform biophysical measurements at scale, inferring more than 22,000 causal 
free energy changes. These energy landscapes quantify how mutations tune the 
binding specificity of a signalling protein and map the inhibitory allosteric 
sites for an important therapeutic target. Allosteric propagation is 
particularly effective across the central β-sheet of KRAS, and multiple surface 
pockets are genetically validated as allosterically active, including a distal 
pocket in the C-terminal lobe of the protein. Allosteric mutations typically 
inhibit binding to all tested effectors, but they can also change the binding 
specificity, revealing the regulatory, evolutionary and therapeutic potential to 
tune pathway activation. Using the approach described here, it should be 
possible to rapidly and comprehensively identify allosteric target sites in many 
proteins.

There is limited guidance on exploiting the genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR 
screens in cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) to identify new targets for individual 
cancer types. This study integrated multiple tools to filter these data in order 
to seek new therapeutic targets specific to head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC). The resulting pipeline prioritized 143 targetable 
dependencies that represented both well-studied targets and emerging target 
classes like mitochondrial carriers and RNA-binding proteins. In total, 14 
targets had clinical inhibitors used for other cancers or nonmalignant diseases 
that hold near-term potential to repurpose for HNSCC therapy. Comparing 
inhibitor response data that were publicly available for 13 prioritized targets 
between the cell lines with high vs. low dependency on each target uncovered 
novel therapeutic potential for the PAK2 serine/threonine kinase. PAK2 gene 
dependency was found to be associated with wild-type p53, low PAK2 mRNA, and 
diploid status of the 3q amplicon containing PAK2. These findings establish a 
generalizable pipeline to prioritize clinically relevant targets for individual 
cancer types using DepMap. Its application to HNSCC highlights novel relevance 
for PAK2 inhibition and identifies biomarkers of PAK2 inhibitor response.

Estimating phenotype networks is a growing field in computational biology. It 
deepens the understanding of disease etiology and is useful in many 
applications. In this study, we present a method that constructs a phenotype 
network by assuming a Gaussian linear structure model embedding a directed 
acyclic graph (DAG). We utilize genetic variants as instrumental variables and 
show how our method only requires access to summary statistics from a 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a reference panel of genotype data. 
Besides estimation, a distinct feature of the method is its summary 
statistics-based likelihood ratio test on directed edges. We applied our method 
to estimate a causal network of 29 cardiovascular-related proteins and linked 
the estimated network to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A simulation study was 
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. An R package sumdag 
implementing the proposed method, all relevant code, and a Shiny application are 
available.

Standigm ASK™ revolutionizes healthcare by addressing the critical challenge of 
identifying pivotal target genes in disease mechanisms-a fundamental aspect of 
drug development success. Standigm ASK™ integrates a unique combination of a 
heterogeneous knowledge graph (KG) database and an attention-based neural 
network model, providing interpretable subgraph evidence. Empowering users 
through an interactive interface, Standigm ASK™ facilitates the exploration of 
predicted results. Applying Standigm ASK™ to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
(IPF), a complex lung disease, we focused on genes (AMFR, MDFIC and NR5A2) 
identified through KG evidence. In vitro experiments demonstrated their 
relevance, as TGFβ treatment induced gene expression changes associated with 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition characteristics. Gene knockdown reversed these 
changes, identifying AMFR, MDFIC and NR5A2 as potential therapeutic targets for 
IPF. In summary, Standigm ASK™ emerges as an innovative KG and artificial 
intelligence platform driving insights in drug target discovery, exemplified by 
the identification and validation of therapeutic targets for IPF.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin 
disease whose pathophysiology involves the interplay between genetic and 
environmental factors, ultimately leading to dysfunction of the epidermis. While 
several treatments are effective in symptom management, many existing therapies 
offer only temporary relief and often come with side effects. For this reason, 
the formulation of an effective therapeutic plan is challenging and there is a 
need for more effective and targeted treatments that address the root causes of 
the condition. Here, we hypothesise that modelling the complexity of the 
molecular buildup of the atopic dermatitis can be a concrete means to drive drug 
discovery.
METHODS: We preprocessed, harmonised and integrated publicly available 
transcriptomics datasets of lesional and non-lesional skin from AD patients. We 
inferred co-expression network models of both AD lesional and non-lesional skin 
and exploited their interactional properties by integrating them with a priori 
knowledge in order to extrapolate a robust AD disease module. 
Pharmacophore-based virtual screening was then utilised to build a tailored 
library of compounds potentially active for AD.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified a core disease module for AD, pinpointing 
known and unknown molecular determinants underlying the skin lesions. We 
identified skin- and immune-cell type signatures expressed by the disease 
module, and characterised the impaired cellular functions underlying the complex 
phenotype of atopic dermatitis. Therefore, by investigating the connectivity of 
genes belonging to the AD module, we prioritised novel putative biomarkers of 
the disease. Finally, we defined a tailored compound library by characterising 
the therapeutic potential of drugs targeting genes within the disease module to 
facilitate and tailor future drug discovery efforts towards novel 
pharmacological strategies for AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study reveals a core disease module providing 
unprecedented information about genetic, transcriptional and pharmacological 
relationships that foster drug discovery in atopic dermatitis.

BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung condition that 
is more prevalent in males than females. The reasons for this are not fully 
understood, with differing environmental exposures due to historically 
sex-biased occupations, or diagnostic bias, being possible explanations. To 
date, over 20 independent genetic variants have been identified to be associated 
with IPF susceptibility, but these have been discovered when combining males and 
females. Our aim was to test for the presence of sex-specific associations with 
IPF susceptibility and assess whether there is a need to consider sex-specific 
effects when evaluating genetic risk in clinical prediction models for IPF.
METHODS: We performed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-by-sex 
interaction studies of IPF risk in six independent IPF case-control studies and 
combined them using inverse-variance weighted fixed effect meta-analysis. In 
total, 4,561 cases (1,280 females and 2,281 males) and 23,500 controls (8,360 
females and 14,528 males) of European genetic ancestry were analysed. We used 
polygenic risk scores (PRS) to assess differences in genetic risk prediction 
between males and females.
FINDINGS: Three independent genetic association signals were identified. All 
showed a consistent direction of effect across all individual IPF studies and an 
opposite direction of effect in IPF susceptibility between females and males. 
None had been previously identified in IPF susceptibility genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS). The predictive accuracy of the PRSs were similar 
between males and females, regardless of whether using combined or sex-specific 
GWAS results.
INTERPRETATION: We prioritised three genetic variants whose effect on IPF risk 
may be modified by sex, however these require further study. We found no 
evidence that the predictive accuracy of common SNP-based PRSs varies 
significantly between males and females.

BACKGROUND: Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) is a unique organ that carries out 
tumor cell elimination at tumor sites. It is continuously stimulated by 
inflammatory tumor signals and has been found to augment immunotherapy response. 
However, the detailed mechanisms behind it still need to be defined.
METHODS: To explore and grasp the whole picture of TLS from a pan-cancer view, 
we collected nine TLS-related genes from previous studies. We performed a 
comprehensive analysis of 9637 samples across 33 tumor types accessed from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. EdU, Transwell, and flow cytometry were 
performed on the feature gene PTGDS in U251 cells. The regulatory role of PTGDS 
on PD-L1 expression and macrophage polarization was verified.
RESULTS: Alteration analysis showed that mutations of TLS-related genes were 
widespread and relatively high. Clustering analysis based on the expression of 
these nine genes obtained two distinct clusters, with high EIF1AY and PTGDS in 
cluster 2 and better overall survival in cluster 1. To distinguish the two 
clusters, we utilized six machine learning algorithms and filtrated EIF1AY, 
PTGDS, SKAP1, and RBP5 as the characteristic genes, among which the former two 
genes were proved to be hazardous. PTGDS was found to regulate PD-L1 expression 
and also promoted the proliferation and migration of U251 cells. The knockdown 
of PTGDS could reduce the migration of macrophages and inhibit the polarization 
of macrophages into M2-phenotype. In addition, we established a TLS score to 
demonstrate patients' TLS activity. The low TLS-score group overlapped with 
cluster 1 and displayed a better prognosis. Besides, the low TLS-score group was 
related to better immunotherapy responses. The HE staining of histopathological 
sections confirmed that the low TLS-score group exhibited higher infiltration of 
immune cells.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals broad molecular, tumorigenic, and immunogenic 
signatures for further functional and therapeutic studies of tertiary lymphoid 
structure. The TLS score we established effectively predicted immunotherapy 
response and patients' survival. Its future application and combination await 
more research.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, with heart 
failure being a complex condition that affects millions of individuals. 
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing has recently emerged as a powerful tool for 
unraveling the molecular mechanisms behind cardiovascular diseases. This 
cutting-edge technology enables the identification of molecular signatures, 
intracellular networks, and spatial relationships among cardiac cells, including 
cardiomyocytes, mast cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, lymphatic endothelial 
cells, endocardial cells, endothelial cells, epicardial cells, adipocytes, 
fibroblasts, neuronal cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells. 
Despite these advancements, the discovery of essential therapeutic targets and 
drugs for precision cardiology remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we 
conducted comprehensive in silico analyses of single-nucleus RNA sequencing 
data, functional enrichment, protein interactome network, and identification of 
the shortest pathways to physiological phenotypes. This integrated multi-omics 
analysis generated CardiOmics signatures, which allowed us to pinpoint three 
therapeutically actionable targets (ADRA1A1, PPARG, and ROCK2) and 15 effective 
drugs, including adrenergic receptor agonists, adrenergic receptor antagonists, 
norepinephrine precursors, PPAR receptor agonists, and Rho-associated kinase 
inhibitors, involved in late-stage cardiovascular disease clinical trials.

Background: Serine protease inhibitor E (SERPINE) family genes participate in 
the tumor growth, cancer cell survival and metastasis. However, the SERPINE 
family members role in the prognosis and their clinical therapeutic potentials 
in various human cancer types have not been elaborately explored. Methods: We 
preliminarily analyzed expression levels and prognostic values of SERPINE family 
genes, and investigated the correlation between SERPINEs expression and tumor 
microenvironment (TME), Stemness score, clinical characteristic, immune 
infiltration, tumor mutational burden (TMB), immune subtype, and drug 
sensitivity in pan-cancer, which based on updated public databases and 
integrated some bioinformatics analysis methods. In addition, we conducted the 
enrichment analysis of SERPINEs from DAVID and KOBAS databases. Results: 
SERPINE1, SERPINE2, and SERPINE3 expression were upregulated in nine cancers, 
twelve cancers, and six cancers, respectively. The expression of SERPINE family 
genes was associated with the prognosis in several cancers from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA). Furthermore, SERPINE family genes expression also had a 
significant relation to stromal and immune scores, and RNA stemness score and 
DNA stemness score in pan-cancer. SERPINE1 and SERPINE2 expression significantly 
increased in tumor advanced stage in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). Results showed 
that SERPINE1 and SERPINE2 expression were negatively related with B cells and 
Monocytes, respectively. SERPINE2 expression had a significantly positive 
relation with B cells and Macrophages. In terms of TMB, SERPINE1, SERPINE2, and 
SERPINE3 were found to associated with TMB in seven cancers, fourteen cancers, 
and four cancers, respectively. Moreover, all SERPINE gene family members were 
significantly correlated with immune subtypes. SERPINE1 expression had a 
significantly positive or negative correlation with drug sensitivity. 
Conclusion: The study indicated the great potential of SERPINE family genes as 
biomarkers for prognosis and provided valuable strategies for further 
investigation of SERPINE family genes as potential targets in cancer.

Target discovery is one of the essential steps in modern drug development, and 
the identification of promising targets is fundamental for developing 
first-in-class drug. A variety of methods have emerged for target assessment 
based on druggability analysis, which refers to the likelihood of a target being 
effectively modulated by drug-like agents. In the therapeutic target database 
(TTD), nine categories of established druggability characteristics were thus 
collected for 426 successful, 1014 clinical trial, 212 preclinical/patented, and 
1479 literature-reported targets via systematic review. These characteristic 
categories were classified into three distinct perspectives: molecular 
interaction/regulation, human system profile and cell-based expression 
variation. With the rapid progression of technology and concerted effort in drug 
discovery, TTD and other databases were highly expected to facilitate the 
explorations of druggability characteristics for the discovery and validation of 
innovative drug target. TTD is now freely accessible at: 
https://idrblab.org/ttd/.

Treatments for neurodegenerative disorders remain rare, but recent FDA 
approvals, such as lecanemab and aducanumab for Alzheimer disease (MIM: 607822), 
highlight the importance of the underlying biological mechanisms in driving 
discovery and creating disease modifying therapies. The global population is 
aging, driving an urgent need for therapeutics that stop disease progression and 
eliminate symptoms. In this study, we create an open framework and resource for 
evidence-based identification of therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative 
disease. We use summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to identify genetic 
targets for drug discovery and repurposing. In parallel, we provide mechanistic 
insights into disease processes and potential network-level consequences of 
gene-based therapeutics. We identify 116 Alzheimer disease, 3 amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (MIM: 105400), 5 Lewy body dementia (MIM: 127750), 46 
Parkinson disease (MIM: 605909), and 9 progressive supranuclear palsy (MIM: 
601104) target genes passing multiple test corrections (pSMR_multi < 2.95 × 10-6 
and pHEIDI > 0.01). We created a therapeutic scheme to classify our identified 
target genes into strata based on druggability and approved therapeutics, 
classifying 41 novel targets, 3 known targets, and 115 difficult targets (of 
these, 69.8% are expressed in the disease-relevant cell type from single-nucleus 
experiments). Our novel class of genes provides a springboard for new 
opportunities in drug discovery, development, and repurposing in the 
pre-competitive space. In addition, looking at drug-gene interaction networks, 
we identify previous trials that may require further follow-up such as riluzole 
in Alzheimer disease. We also provide a user-friendly web platform to help users 
explore potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases, decreasing 
activation energy for the community.

Gene therapy holds promise as a life-changing option for individuals with 
genetic variants that give rise to disease. FDA-approved gene therapies for 
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, β-Thalassemia, 
hemophilia A/B, retinal dystrophy, and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy have 
generated buzz around the ability to change the course of genetic syndromes. 
However, this excitement risks over-expansion into areas of genetic disease that 
may not fit the current state of gene therapy. While in situ (targeted to an 
area) and ex vivo (removal of cells, delivery, and administration of cells) 
approaches show promise, they have a limited target ability. Broader in vivo 
gene therapy trials have shown various continued challenges, including immune 
response, use of immune suppressants correlating to secondary infections, 
unknown outcomes of overexpression, and challenges in driving tissue-specific 
corrections. Viral delivery systems can be associated with adverse outcomes such 
as hepatotoxicity and lethality if uncontrolled. In some cases, these risks are 
far outweighed by the potentially lethal syndromes for which these systems are 
being developed. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the field of genetic 
diseases to perform cost-benefit analyses for gene therapy. In this work, we 
present the current state while setting forth tools and resources to guide 
informed directions to avoid foreseeable issues in gene therapy that could 
prevent the field from continued success.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a lethal malignancy, largely due 
to the paucity of reliable biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic 
targeting. Existing blood protein biomarkers for PDAC often suffer from 
replicability issues, arising from inherent limitations such as unmeasured 
confounding factors in conventional epidemiologic study designs. To circumvent 
these limitations, we use genetic instruments to identify proteins with 
genetically predicted levels to be associated with PDAC risk. Leveraging genome 
and plasma proteome data from the INTERVAL study, we established and validated 
models to predict protein levels using genetic variants. By examining 8,275 PDAC 
cases and 6,723 controls, we identified 40 associated proteins, of which 16 are 
novel. Functionally validating these candidates by focusing on 2 selected novel 
protein-encoding genes, GOLM1 and B4GALT1, we demonstrated their pivotal roles 
in driving PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, we 
also identified potential drug repurposing opportunities for treating PDAC.
SIGNIFICANCE: PDAC is a notoriously difficult-to-treat malignancy, and our 
limited understanding of causal protein markers hampers progress in developing 
effective early detection strategies and treatments. Our study identifies novel 
causal proteins using genetic instruments and subsequently functionally 
validates selected novel proteins. This dual approach enhances our understanding 
of PDAC etiology and potentially opens new avenues for therapeutic 
interventions.

Initiatives to share assets in the life science sector through dedicated 
partnerships had and still have a multitude of different aspects in the past few 
decades. The range goes from industry partners, small and big companies, in 
bilateral agreements with academic institutions up to large privately and 
publicly funded consortia. In general, the term public-private partnership (PPP) 
is used when at least one public (non-profit, academic, and/or government) part 
and one or more private for-profit partners are involved. A Public-Private 
Partnership is often driven by a public body, i.e. a ministry or a public 
agency. Their synergism has been described 10 years ago (Dearing, Science 
315(19):344-347, 2007; Casty and Wieman, Ther Innov Regul Sci 47(3):375-383, 
2013; Stevens et al., Biotechnol Law Rep 34(4):153-165, 2015). So why view this 
synergism again today? It will be shown that the situation in life science has 
changed: novel partners acting digital, data expertise being involved on many 
levels and novel partnering models arising. Success and challenges will be 
described in this chapter.

The explosive growth of biomedical Big Data presents both significant 
opportunities and challenges in the realm of knowledge discovery and 
translational applications within precision medicine. Efficient management, 
analysis, and interpretation of big data can pave the way for groundbreaking 
advancements in precision medicine. However, the unprecedented strides in the 
automated collection of large-scale molecular and clinical data have also 
introduced formidable challenges in terms of data analysis and interpretation, 
necessitating the development of novel computational approaches. Some potential 
challenges include the curse of dimensionality, data heterogeneity, missing 
data, class imbalance, and scalability issues. This overview article focuses on 
the recent progress and breakthroughs in the application of big data within 
precision medicine. Key aspects are summarized, including content, data sources, 
technologies, tools, challenges, and existing gaps. Nine fields-Datawarehouse 
and data management, electronic medical record, biomedical imaging informatics, 
Artificial intelligence-aided surgical design and surgery optimization, omics 
data, health monitoring data, knowledge graph, public health informatics, and 
security and privacy-are discussed.

Studies have shown that drug targets with human genetic support are more likely 
to succeed in clinical trials. Hence, a tool integrating genetic evidence to 
prioritize drug target genes is beneficial for drug discovery. We built a 
genetic priority score (GPS) by integrating eight genetic features with drug 
indications from the Open Targets and SIDER databases. The top 0.83%, 0.28% and 
0.19% of the GPS conferred a 5.3-, 9.9- and 11.0-fold increased effect of having 
an indication, respectively. In addition, we observed that targets in the top 
0.28% of the score were 1.7-, 3.7- and 8.8-fold more likely to advance from 
phase I to phases II, III and IV, respectively. Complementary to the GPS, we 
incorporated the direction of genetic effect and drug mechanism into a 
directional version of the score called the GPS with direction of effect. We 
applied our method to 19,365 protein-coding genes and 399 drug indications and 
made all results available through a web portal.

Recently, drug repurposing has emerged as an effective and resource-efficient 
paradigm for AD drug discovery. Among various methods for drug repurposing, 
network-based methods have shown promising results as they are capable of 
leveraging complex networks that integrate multiple interaction types, such as 
protein-protein interactions, to more effectively identify candidate drugs. 
However, existing approaches typically assume paths of the same length in the 
network have equal importance in identifying the therapeutic effect of drugs. 
Other domains have found that same length paths do not necessarily have the same 
importance. Thus, relying on this assumption may be deleterious to drug 
repurposing attempts. In this work, we propose MPI (Modeling Path Importance), a 
novel network-based method for AD drug repurposing. MPI is unique in that it 
prioritizes important paths via learned node embeddings, which can effectively 
capture a network's rich structural information. Thus, leveraging learned 
embeddings allows MPI to effectively differentiate the importance among paths. 
We evaluate MPI against a commonly used baseline method that identifies anti-AD 
drug candidates primarily based on the shortest paths between drugs and AD in 
the network. We observe that among the top-50 ranked drugs, MPI prioritizes 
20.0% more drugs with anti-AD evidence compared to the baseline. Finally, Cox 
proportional-hazard models produced from insurance claims data aid us in 
identifying the use of etodolac, nicotine, and BBB-crossing ACE-INHs as having a 
reduced risk of AD, suggesting such drugs may be viable candidates for 
repurposing and should be explored further in future studies.

In 2001, the release of the first draft of the human genome marked the beginning 
of the Big Data era for biological sciences. Since then, the complexity of 
datasets generated by laboratories worldwide has increased exponentially. Public 
repositories such as the Protein Data Bank, which has exceeded the 200000 
entries in 2023, have been instrumental not only to collect, organize, and 
distill this enormous research output but also to promote further research 
enterprises. The achievements of artificial intelligence programs such as 
AlphaFold would not have been possible without the collective efforts of 
countless researchers who made their work publicly available. Here, I provide a 
practical, but far from exhaustive, list of resources useful to investigate 
protease function.

The stimulant methylphenidate (MPH) and the non-stimulant atomoxetine (ATX) are 
frequently used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD); however, the function of these drugs in different types of brain cells 
and their effects on related genes remain largely unknown. To address these 
questions, we built a pipeline for the simultaneous examination of the activity 
behavior and transcriptional responses of Drosophila melanogaster at single-cell 
resolution following drug treatment. We selected the Drosophila with 
significantly increased locomotor activities (hyperactivity-like behavior) 
following the administration of each drug in comparison with the control (same 
food as the drug-treated groups with 5% sucrose, yeast, and blue food dye 
solution) using EasyFlyTracker. Subsequently, single cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNASEQ) was used to capture the transcriptome of 82,917 cells, unsupervised 
clustering analysis of which yielded 28 primary cell clusters representing the 
major cell types in adult Drosophila brain. Indeed, both neuronal and glial 
cells responded to MPH and ATX. Further analysis of differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) revealed distinct transcriptional changes associated with these two 
drugs, such as two well-studied dopamine receptor genes (Dop2R and DopEcR) were 
responsive to MPH but not to ATX at their optimal doses, in addition to genes 
involved in dopamine metabolism pathways such as Syt1, Sytalpha, Syt7, and Ih in 
different cell types. More importantly, MPH also suppressed the expression of 
genes encoding other neurotransmitter receptors and synaptic signaling molecules 
in many cell types, especially those for Glu and GABA, while the responsive 
effects of ATX were much weaker. In addition to monoaminergic neuronal 
transmitters, other neurotransmitters have also shown a similar pattern with 
respect to a stronger effect associated with MPH than with ATX. Moreover, we 
identified four distinct glial cell subtypes responsive to the two drugs and 
detected a greater number of differentially expressed genes associated with 
ensheathing and astrocyte-like glia. Furthermore, our study provides a rich 
resource of candidate target genes, supported by drug set enrichment analysis 
(P = 2.10E-4; hypergeometric test), for the further exploration of drug 
repurposing. The whole list of candidates can be found at ADHDrug ( 
http://adhdrug.cibr.ac.cn/ ). In conclusion, we propose a fast and 
cost-efficient pipeline to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of ADHD 
drug treatment in Drosophila brain at single-cell resolution, which may further 
facilitate drug repurposing applications.

Tauopathies, diseases characterized by neuropathological aggregates of tau 
including Alzheimer's disease and subtypes of frontotemporal dementia, make up 
the vast majority of dementia cases. Although there have been recent 
developments in tauopathy biomarkers and disease-modifying treatments, ongoing 
progress is required to ensure these are effective, economical, and accessible 
for the globally ageing population. As such, continued identification of new 
potential drug targets and biomarkers is critical. "Big data" studies, such as 
proteomics, can generate information on thousands of possible new targets for 
dementia diagnostics and therapeutics, but currently remain underutilized due to 
the lack of a clear process by which targets are selected for future drug 
development. In this review, we discuss current tauopathy biomarkers and 
therapeutics, and highlight areas in need of improvement, particularly when 
addressing the needs of frail, comorbid and cognitively impaired populations. We 
highlight biomarkers which have been developed from proteomic data, and outline 
possible future directions in this field. We propose new criteria by which 
potential targets in proteomics studies can be objectively ranked as favorable 
for drug development, and demonstrate its application to our group's recent tau 
interactome dataset as an example.

BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Xiao Jianzhong Tang (XJZ) has a 
favorable efficacy in the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). 
However, its pharmacological mechanism has not been fully explained.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to find the potential mechanism of XJZ 
in the treatment of CAG using pharmacocoinformatics approaches.
METHODS: Network pharmacology was used to screen out the key compounds and key 
targets, MODELLER and GNNRefine were used to repair and refine proteins, 
Autodock vina was employed to perform molecular docking, Δ Lin_F9XGB was used to 
score the docking results, and Gromacs was used to perform molecular dynamics 
simulations (MD).
RESULTS: Kaempferol, licochalcone A, and naringenin, were obtained as key 
compounds, while AKT1, MAPK1, MAPK14, RELA, STAT1, and STAT3 were acquired as 
key targets. Among docking results, 12 complexes scored greater than five. They 
were run for 50ns MD. The free binding energy of AKT1-licochalcone A and 
MAPK1-licochalcone A was less than -15 kcal/mol and AKT1-naringenin and 
STAT3-licochalcone A was less than -9 kcal/mol. These complexes were crucial in 
XJZ treating CAG.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that licochalcone A could act on AKT1, MAPK1, 
and STAT3, and naringenin could act on AKT1 to play the potential therapeutic 
effect on CAG. The work also provides a powerful approach to interpreting the 
complex mechanism of TCM through the amalgamation of network pharmacology, deep 
learning-based protein refinement, molecular docking, machine learning-based 
binding affinity estimation, MD simulations, and MM-PBSA-based estimation of 
binding free energy.

The persistence of inflammatory and neuropathic pain is poorly understood. We 
investigated a novel therapeutic paradigm by targeting gene networks that 
sustain or reverse persistent pain states. Our prior observations found that 
Sp1-like transcription factors drive the expression of TRPV1, a pain receptor, 
that is blocked in vitro by mithramycin A (MTM), an inhibitor of Sp1-like 
factors. Here, we investigate the ability of MTM to reverse in vivo models of 
inflammatory and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) pain and 
explore MTM's underlying mechanisms. Mithramycin reversed inflammatory heat 
hyperalgesia induced by complete Freund adjuvant and cisplatin-induced heat and 
mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, MTM reversed both short-term and 
long-term (1 month) oxaliplatin-induced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, 
without the rescue of intraepidermal nerve fiber loss. Mithramycin reversed 
oxaliplatin-induced cold hypersensitivity and oxaliplatin-induced TRPM8 
overexpression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Evidence across multiple 
transcriptomic profiling approaches suggest that MTM reverses inflammatory and 
neuropathic pain through broad transcriptional and alternative splicing 
regulatory actions. Mithramycin-dependent changes in gene expression following 
oxaliplatin treatment were largely opposite to and rarely overlapped with 
changes in gene expression induced by oxaliplatin alone. Notably, RNAseq 
analysis revealed MTM rescue of oxaliplatin-induced dysregulation of 
mitochondrial electron transport chain genes that correlated with in vivo 
reversal of excess reactive oxygen species in DRG neurons. This finding suggests 
that the mechanism(s) driving persistent pain states such as CIPN are not fixed 
but are sustained by ongoing modifiable transcription-dependent processes.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with 
non-syndromic tooth agenesis (TA) in nine families from Mongolia using 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study enrolled 41 participants, including three 
inherited and six non-inherited families. WES analysis was performed on 14 
saliva samples from individuals with non-syndromic TA. The potential candidate 
genes were identified through variant filtering and segregation analysis. The 
filtered variants were then analyzed in silico mutation impact analysis.
RESULTS: WES analysis identified 21 variants associated with TA, and 5 of these 
variants met all filtering criteria. These variants were located in the exome 
region of MAST4, ITGA6, PITX2, CACNA1S, and CDON genes. The variant in PITX2 was 
found in eight participants from inherited and non-inherited families, while the 
MAST4 variant was identified in 6 participants from inherited families.
CONCLUSIONS: The study identified various genetic variant candidates associated 
with TA in different family groups, with PITX2 being the most commonly 
identified. Our findings suggest that MAST4 may also be a novel candidate gene 
for TA due to its association with the Wnt signaling pathway. Additionally, we 
found that five candidate genes related to focal adhesion and calcium channel 
complex were significant and essential in tooth development.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Identifying new pathogenic genes associated with TA can 
improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease, 
leading to better diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. Early detection of TA 
based on biomarkers can improve dental management and facilitate orthodontic and 
prosthetic treatment.

Machine learning, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and 
generative artificial intelligence are revolutionising every area of our lives 
when data are made available. With the help of these methods, we can decipher 
information from larger datasets while addressing the complex nature of 
biological systems in a more efficient way. Although machine learning methods 
have been introduced to human genetic epidemiological research as early as 2004, 
those were never used to their full capacity. In this review, we outline some of 
the main applications of machine learning to assigning human genetic loci to 
health outcomes. We summarise widely used methods and discuss their advantages 
and challenges. We also identify several tools, such as Combi, GenNet, and 
GMSTool, specifically designed to integrate these methods for hypothesis-free 
analysis of genetic variation data. We elaborate on the additional value and 
limitations of these tools from a geneticist's perspective. Finally, we discuss 
the fast-moving field of foundation models and large multi-modal omics biobank 
initiatives.

Transcriptome studies disentangle functional mechanisms of gene expression 
regulation and may elucidate the underlying biology of disease processes. 
However, the types of tissues currently collected typically assay a single 
post-mortem timepoint or are limited to investigating cell types found in blood. 
Noninvasive tissues may improve disease-relevant discovery by enabling more 
complex longitudinal study designs, by capturing different and potentially more 
applicable cell types, and by increasing sample sizes due to reduced collection 
costs and possible higher enrollment from vulnerable populations. Here, we 
develop methods for sampling noninvasive biospecimens, investigate their 
performance across commercial and in-house library preparations, characterize 
their biology, and assess the feasibility of using noninvasive tissues in a 
multitude of transcriptomic applications. We collected buccal swabs, hair 
follicles, saliva, and urine cell pellets from 19 individuals over three to four 
timepoints, for a total of 300 unique biological samples, which we then prepared 
with replicates across three library preparations, for a final tally of 472 
transcriptomes. Of the four tissues we studied, we found hair follicles and 
urine cell pellets to be most promising due to the consistency of sample 
quality, the cell types and expression profiles we observed, and their 
performance in disease-relevant applications. This is the first study to 
thoroughly delineate biological and technical features of noninvasive samples 
and demonstrate their use in a wide array of transcriptomic and clinical 
analyses. We anticipate future use of these biospecimens will facilitate 
discovery and development of clinical applications.

The fundamental goal of small molecule discovery is to generate chemicals with 
target functionality. While this often proceeds through structure-based methods, 
we set out to investigate the practicality of orthogonal methods that leverage 
the extensive corpus of chemical literature. We hypothesize that a sufficiently 
large text-derived chemical function dataset would mirror the actual landscape 
of chemical functionality. Such a landscape would implicitly capture complex 
physical and biological interactions given that chemical function arises from 
both a molecule's structure and its interacting partners. To evaluate this 
hypothesis, we built a Chemical Function (CheF) dataset of patent-derived 
functional labels. This dataset, comprising 631K molecule-function pairs, was 
created using an LLM- and embedding-based method to obtain functional labels for 
approximately 100K molecules from their corresponding 188K unique patents. We 
carry out a series of analyses demonstrating that the CheF dataset contains a 
semantically coherent textual representation of the functional landscape 
congruent with chemical structural relationships, thus approximating the actual 
chemical function landscape. We then demonstrate that this text-based functional 
landscape can be leveraged to identify drugs with target functionality using a 
model able to predict functional profiles from structure alone. We believe that 
functional label-guided molecular discovery may serve as an orthogonal approach 
to traditional structure-based methods in the pursuit of designing novel 
functional molecules.

Rare genetic diseases affect millions, and identifying causal DNA variants is 
essential for patient care. Therefore, it is imperative to estimate the effect 
of each independent variant and improve their pathogenicity classification. Our 
study of 140 214 unrelated UK Biobank (UKB) participants found that each of them 
carries a median of 7 variants previously reported as pathogenic or likely 
pathogenic. We focused on 967 diagnostic-grade gene (DGG) variants for rare 
bleeding, thrombotic, and platelet disorders (BTPDs) observed in 12 367 UKB 
participants. By association analysis, for a subset of these variants, we 
estimated effect sizes for platelet count and volume, and odds ratios for 
bleeding and thrombosis. Variants causal of some autosomal recessive platelet 
disorders revealed phenotypic consequences in carriers. Loss-of-function 
variants in MPL, which cause chronic amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia if 
biallelic, were unexpectedly associated with increased platelet counts in 
carriers. We also demonstrated that common variants identified by genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) for platelet count or thrombosis risk may influence 
the penetrance of rare variants in BTPD DGGs on their associated hemostasis 
disorders. Network-propagation analysis applied to an interactome of 18 410 
nodes and 571 917 edges showed that GWAS variants with large effect sizes are 
enriched in DGGs and their first-order interactors. Finally, we illustrate the 
modifying effect of polygenic scores for platelet count and thrombosis risk on 
disease severity in participants carrying rare variants in TUBB1 or PROC and 
PROS1, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the power of association analyses 
using large population datasets in improving pathogenicity classifications of 
rare variants.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women, 
representing approximately 25% of cancer fatalities each year. The treatment 
landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly evolving due to the 
progress made in biomarker-driven targeted therapies. While advancements in 
targeted treatments have improved survival rates for NSCLC patients with 
actionable biomarkers, long-term survival remains low, with an overall 5-year 
relative survival rate below 20%. Artificial intelligence/machine learning 
(AI/ML) algorithms have shown promise in biomarker discovery, yet NSCLC-specific 
studies capturing the clinical challenges targeted and emerging patterns 
identified using AI/ML approaches are lacking. Here, we employed a text-mining 
approach and identified 215 studies that reported potential biomarkers of NSCLC 
using AI/ML algorithms. We catalogued these studies with respect to BEST 
(Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) biomarker sub-types and summarized 
emerging patterns and trends in AI/ML-driven NSCLC biomarker discovery. We 
anticipate that our comprehensive review will contribute to the current 
understanding of AI/ML advances in NSCLC biomarker research and provide an 
important catalogue that may facilitate clinical adoption of AI/ML-derived 
biomarkers.

Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is critical in the development and progression of 
cardiovascular (CV) disorders, yet effective therapeutic targets for ED remain 
elusive due to limited understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms. To 
address this gap, we employed a systems biology approach to identify potential 
targets for ED. Our study combined multi omics data integration, with siRNA 
screening, high content imaging and network analysis to prioritise key ED genes 
and identify a pro- and anti-ED network. We found 26 genes that, upon silencing, 
exacerbated the ED phenotypes tested, and network propagation identified a 
pro-ED network enriched in functions associated with inflammatory responses. 
Conversely, 31 genes ameliorated ED phenotypes, pointing to potential ED 
targets, and the respective anti-ED network was enriched in hypoxia, 
angiogenesis and cancer-related processes. An independent screen with 17 drugs 
found general agreement with the trends from our siRNA screen and further 
highlighted DUSP1, IL6 and CCL2 as potential candidates for targeting ED. 
Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of integrated system biology 
approaches in discovering disease-specific candidate drug targets for 
endothelial dysfunction.

Problematic alcohol use (PAU), a trait that combines alcohol use disorder and 
alcohol-related problems assessed with a questionnaire, is a leading cause of 
death and morbidity worldwide. Here we conducted a large cross-ancestry 
meta-analysis of PAU in 1,079,947 individuals (European, N = 903,147; African, 
N = 122,571; Latin American, N = 38,962; East Asian, N = 13,551; and South 
Asian, N = 1,716 ancestries). We observed a high degree of cross-ancestral 
similarity in the genetic architecture of PAU and identified 110 independent 
risk variants in within- and cross-ancestry analyses. Cross-ancestry fine 
mapping improved the identification of likely causal variants. Prioritizing 
genes through gene expression and chromatin interaction in brain tissues 
identified multiple genes associated with PAU. We identified existing 
medications for potential pharmacological studies by a computational drug 
repurposing analysis. Cross-ancestry polygenic risk scores showed better 
performance of association in independent samples than single-ancestry polygenic 
risk scores. Genetic correlations between PAU and other traits were observed in

correlations. This study advances our knowledge of the genetic etiology of PAU, 
and these findings may bring possible clinical applicability of genetics 
insights-together with neuroscience, biology and data science-closer.

Hemorrhoids are a prevalent medical condition that necessitates effective 
treatment options. The current options for treatment consist of oral 
medications, topical applications, or surgery, yet a scarcity of highly 
effective drugs still exists. Genetic markers provide promising avenues for 
investigating the treatment of hemorrhoids, as they may reveal intricate 
biological mechanisms and targeted drug therapies, ultimately enhancing more 
precise treatment tailored to the patient. This study aims to identify new drug 
candidates for treating hemorrhoids through a meticulous bioinformatics approach 
and integrated with genomic network analysis. After extracting 21 druggable 
target genes using DrugBank from 293 genes connected to hemorrhoids, 87 possible 
drugs were selected. Three of these drugs (ketamine, methylene blue, and 
fulvestrant) hold potential in addressing issues associated with hemorrhoids and 
have been supported by clinical or preclinical studies. Eighty-four compounds 
present new therapeutic possibilities for managing hemorrhoids. We highlight 
that our findings indicate that NOX1 and NOS3 genes are promising biomarkers, 
with NOS3 gaining significance owing to its robust systemic functional 
annotations. Sapropterin, an existing drug, is closely associated with NOS3, 
providing a clear target for biomarker-driven interventions. This study 
illustrates the potential of combining genomic network analysis with 
bioinformatics to repurpose drugs for treating hemorrhoids. Subsequent research 
will explore the mechanisms for utilizing NOS3 targeting in the treatment of 
hemorrhoids.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease 
(MASLD) affects over 25% of the population and currently has no effective 
treatments. Plasma proteins with causal evidence may represent promising drug 
targets. We aimed to identify plasma proteins in the causal pathway of MASLD and 
explore their interaction with obesity.
METHODS: We analysed 2,941 plasma proteins in 43,978 European participants from 
UK Biobank. We performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) for all 
MASLD-associated proteins and created the largest MASLD GWAS (109,885 
cases/1,014,923 controls). We performed Mendelian Randomization (MR) and 
integrated proteins and their encoding genes in MASLD ranges to identify 
candidate causal proteins. We then validated them through independent 
replication, exome sequencing, liver imaging, bulk and single-cell gene 
expression, liver biopsies, pathway, and phenome-wide data. We explored the role 
of obesity by MR and multivariable MR across proteins, body mass index, and 
MASLD.
RESULTS: We found 929 proteins associated with MASLD, reported five novel 
genetic loci associated with MASLD, and identified 17 candidate MASLD protein 
targets. We identified four novel targets for MASLD (CD33, GRHPR, HMOX2, and 
SCG3), provided protein evidence supporting roles of AHCY, FCGR2B, ORM1, and 
RBKS in MASLD, and validated nine previously known targets. We found that CD33, 
FCGR2B, ORM1, RBKS, and SCG3 mediated the association of obesity and MASLD, and 
HMOX2, ORM1, and RBKS had effect on MASLD independent of obesity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified new protein targets in the causal pathway of 
MASLD, providing new insights into the multi-omics architecture and 
pathophysiology of MASLD. These findings advise further therapeutic 
interventions for MASLD.

Estimating phenotype networks is a growing field in computational biology. It 
deepens the understanding of disease etiology and is useful in many 
applications. In this study, we present a method that constructs a phenotype 
network by assuming a Gaussian linear structure model embedding a directed 
acyclic graph (DAG). We utilize genetic variants as instrumental variables and 
show how our method only requires access to summary statistics from a 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a reference panel of genotype data. 
Besides estimation, a distinct feature of the method is its summary 
statistics-based likelihood ratio test on directed edges. We applied our method 
to estimate a causal network of 29 cardiovascular-related proteins and linked 
the estimated network to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A simulation study was 
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. An R package sumdag 
implementing the proposed method, all relevant code, and a Shiny application are 
available at https://github.com/chunlinli/sumdag.

In clinical practice, the co-existence of endometriosis and gastrointestinal 
symptoms is often observed. Using large-scale datasets, we report a genetic 
correlation between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic 
ulcer disease (PUD), gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GORD), and a combined 
GORD/PUD medicated (GPM) phenotype. Mendelian randomization analyses support a 
causal relationship between genetic predisposition to endometriosis and IBS and 
GPM. Identification of shared risk loci highlights biological pathways that may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, including estrogen regulation 
and inflammation, and potential therapeutic drug targets (CCKBR; PDE4B). Higher 
use of IBS, GORD, and PUD medications in women with endometriosis and higher use 
of hormone therapies in women with IBS, GORD, and PUD, support the co-occurrence 
of these conditions and highlight the potential for drug repositioning and drug 
contraindications. Our results provide evidence of shared disease etiology and 
have important clinical implications for diagnostic and treatment decisions for 
both diseases.

Many tools and algorithms are available for analyzing transcriptomics data. 
These include algorithms for performing sequence alignment, data normalization 
and imputation, clustering, identifying differentially expressed genes, and 
performing gene set enrichment analysis. To make the best choice about which 
tools to use, objective benchmarks can be developed to compare the quality of 
different algorithms to extract biological knowledge maximally and accurately 
from these data. The Dexamethasone Benchmark (Dex-Benchmark) resource aims to 
fill this need by providing the community with datasets and code templates for 
benchmarking different gene expression analysis tools and algorithms. The 
resource provides access to a collection of curated RNA-seq, L1000, and ChIP-seq 
data from dexamethasone treatment as well as genetic perturbations of its known 
targets. In addition, the website provides Jupyter Notebooks that use these 
pre-processed curated datasets to demonstrate how to benchmark the different 
steps in gene expression analysis. By comparing two independent data sources and 
data types with some expected concordance, we can assess which tools and 
algorithms best recover such associations. To demonstrate the usefulness of the 
resource for discovering novel drug targets, we applied it to optimize data 
processing strategies for the chemical perturbations and CRISPR single gene 
knockouts from the L1000 transcriptomics data from the Library of Integrated 
Network Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program, with a focus on understudied 
proteins from the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program. Overall, the 
Dex-Benchmark resource can be utilized to assess the quality of transcriptomics 
and other related bioinformatics data analysis workflows. The resource is 
available from: https://maayanlab.github.io/dex-benchmark.

Mapping the functional human genome and impact of genetic variants is often 
limited to European-descendent population samples. To aid in overcoming this 
limitation, we measured gene expression using RNA sequencing in lymphoblastoid 
cell lines (LCLs) from 599 individuals from six African populations to identify 
novel transcripts including those not represented in the hg38 reference genome. 
We used whole genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 164 Maasai individuals 
to identify 8,881 expression and 6,949 splicing quantitative trait loci 
(eQTLs/sQTLs), and 2,611 structural variants associated with gene expression 
(SV-eQTLs). We further profiled chromatin accessibility using ATAC-Seq in a 
subset of 100 representative individuals, to identity chromatin accessibility 
quantitative trait loci (caQTLs) and allele-specific chromatin accessibility, 
and provide predictions for the functional effect of 78.9 million variants on 
chromatin accessibility. Using this map of eQTLs and caQTLs we fine-mapped GWAS 
signals for a range of complex diseases. Combined, this work expands global 
functional genomic data to identify novel transcripts, functional elements and 
variants, understand population genetic history of molecular quantitative trait 
loci, and further resolve the genetic basis of multiple human traits and 
disease.

Prostate cancer (PCa) brings huge public health burden in men. A growing number 
of conventional observational studies report associations of multiple 
circulating proteins with PCa risk. However, the existing findings may be 
subject to incoherent biases of conventional epidemiologic studies. To better 
characterize their associations, herein, we evaluated associations of 
genetically predicted concentrations of plasma proteins with PCa risk. We 
developed comprehensive genetic prediction models for protein levels in plasma. 
After testing 1308 proteins in 79 194 cases and 61 112 controls of European 
ancestry included in the consortia of BPC3, CAPS, CRUK, PEGASUS, and PRACTICAL, 
24 proteins showed significant associations with PCa risk, including 16 
previously reported proteins and eight novel proteins. Of them, 14 proteins 
showed negative associations and 10 showed positive associations with PCa risk. 
For 18 of the identified proteins, potential functional somatic changes of 
encoding genes were detected in PCa patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 
Genes encoding these proteins were significantly involved in cancer-related 
pathways. We further identified drugs targeting the identified proteins, which 
may serve as candidates for drug repurposing for treating PCa. In conclusion, 
this study identifies novel protein biomarker candidates for PCa risk, which may 
provide new perspectives on the etiology of PCa and improve its therapeutic 
strategies.

neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Investigating genetic risk variants across 
these NDDs can give further insight into disease manifestations. In this study 
we have leveraged genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and genome-wide 
association study summary statistics to cluster patients based on their genetic 
status across identified risk variants for five NDDs (Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy body dementia and 
frontotemporal dementia). The multi-disease and disease-specific clustering 
results presented here provide evidence that NDDs have more overlapping genetic 
aetiology than previously expected and how neurodegeneration should be viewed as 
a spectrum of symptomology. These clustering analyses also show potential 
subsets of patients with these diseases that are significantly depleted for any 
known common genetic risk factors suggesting environmental or other factors at 
work. Establishing that NDDs with overlapping pathologies share genetic risk 
loci, future research into how these variants might have different effects on 
downstream protein expression, pathology and NDD manifestation in general is 
important for refining and treating NDDs.

Early de-risking of drug targets and chemistry is essential to provide drug 
projects with the best chance of success. Target safety assessments (TSAs) use 
target biology, gene and protein expression data, genetic information from 
humans and animals, and competitor compound intelligence to understand the 
potential safety risks associated with modulating a drug target. However, there 
is a vast amount of information, updated daily that must be considered for each 
TSA. We have developed a data science-based approach that allows acquisition of 
relevant evidence for an optimal TSA. This is built on expert-led conventional 
and artificial intelligence-based mining of literature and other bioinformatics 
databases. Potential safety risks are identified according to an evidence 
framework, adjusted to the degree of target novelty. Expert knowledge is 
necessary to interpret the evidence and to take account of the nuances of drug 
safety, the modality, and the intended patient population for each TSA within 
each project. Overall, TSAs take full advantage of the most recent developments 
in data science and can be used within drug projects to identify and mitigate 
risks, helping with informed decision-making and resource management. These 
approaches should be used in the earliest stages of a drug project to guide 
decisions such as target selection, discovery chemistry options, in vitro assay 
choice, and end points for investigative in vivo studies.

BACKGROUND: Long COVID is a debilitating chronic condition that has affected 
over 100 million people globally. It is characterized by a diverse array of 
symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and respiratory problems. 
Studies have so far largely failed to identify genetic associations, the 
mechanisms behind the disease, or any common pathophysiology with other 
conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) 
that present with similar symptoms.
METHODS: We used a combinatorial analysis approach to identify combinations of 
genetic variants significantly associated with the development of long COVID and 
to examine the biological mechanisms underpinning its various symptoms. We 
compared two subpopulations of long COVID patients from Sano Genetics' Long 
COVID GOLD study cohort, focusing on patients with severe or fatigue dominant 
phenotypes. We evaluated the genetic signatures previously identified in an 
ME/CFS population against this long COVID population to understand similarities 
with other fatigue disorders that may be triggered by a prior viral infection. 
Finally, we also compared the output of this long COVID analysis against known 
genetic associations in other chronic diseases, including a range of metabolic 
and neurological disorders, to understand the overlap of pathophysiological 
mechanisms.
RESULTS: Combinatorial analysis identified 73 genes that were highly associated 
with at least one of the long COVID populations included in this analysis. Of 
these, 9 genes have prior associations with acute COVID-19, and 14 were 
differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of long COVID patients. A 
pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the biological pathways most 
significantly associated with the 73 long COVID genes were mainly aligned with 
neurological and cardiometabolic diseases. Expanded genotype analysis suggests 
that specific SNX9 genotypes are a significant contributor to the risk of or 
protection against severe long COVID infection, but that the gene-disease 
relationship is context dependent and mediated by interactions with KLF15 and 
RYR3. Comparison of the genes uniquely associated with the Severe and Fatigue 
Dominant long COVID patients revealed significant differences between the 
pathways enriched in each subgroup. The genes unique to Severe long COVID 
patients were associated with immune pathways such as myeloid differentiation 
and macrophage foam cells. Genes unique to the Fatigue Dominant subgroup were 
enriched in metabolic pathways such as MAPK/JNK signaling. We also identified 
overlap in the genes associated with Fatigue Dominant long COVID and ME/CFS, 
including several involved in circadian rhythm regulation and insulin 
regulation. Overall, 39 SNPs associated in this study with long COVID can be 
linked to 9 genes identified in a recent combinatorial analysis of ME/CFS 
patient from UK Biobank. Among the 73 genes associated with long COVID, 42 are 
potentially tractable for novel drug discovery approaches, with 13 of these 
already targeted by drugs in clinical development pipelines. From this analysis 
for example, we identified TLR4 antagonists as repurposing candidates with 
potential to protect against long term cognitive impairment pathology caused by 
SARS-CoV-2. We are currently evaluating the repurposing potential of these drug 
targets for use in treating long COVID and/or ME/CFS.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the power of combinatorial analytics for 
stratifying heterogeneous populations in complex diseases that do not have 
simple monogenic etiologies. These results build upon the genetic findings from 
combinatorial analyses of severe acute COVID-19 patients and an ME/CFS 
population and we expect that access to additional independent, larger patient 
datasets will further improve the disease insights and validate potential 
treatment options in long COVID.

Joint analysis of single-cell genomics data from diseased tissues and a healthy 
reference can reveal altered cell states. We investigate whether integrated 
collections of data from healthy individuals (cell atlases) are suitable 
references for disease-state identification and whether matched control samples 
are needed to minimize false discoveries. We demonstrate that using a reference 
atlas for latent space learning followed by differential analysis against 
matched controls leads to improved identification of disease-associated cells, 
especially with multiple perturbed cell types. Additionally, when an atlas is 
available, reducing control sample numbers does not increase false discovery 
rates. Jointly analyzing data from a COVID-19 cohort and a blood cell atlas, we 
improve detection of infection-related cell states linked to distinct clinical 
severities. Similarly, we studied disease states in pulmonary fibrosis using a 
healthy lung atlas, characterizing two distinct aberrant basal states. Our 
analysis provides guidelines for designing disease cohort studies and optimizing 
cell atlas use.

Refractoriness to initial chemotherapy and relapse after remission are the main 
obstacles to cure in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Biomarker 
guided risk stratification and targeted therapy have the potential to improve 
outcomes in high-risk T-ALL; however, cellular and genetic factors contributing 
to treatment resistance remain unknown. Previous bulk genomic studies in T-ALL 
have implicated tumor heterogeneity as an unexplored mechanism for treatment 
failure. To link tumor subpopulations with clinical outcome, we created an atlas 
of healthy pediatric hematopoiesis and applied single-cell multiomic 
(CITE-seq/snATAC-seq) analysis to a cohort of 40 cases of T-ALL treated on the 
Children's Oncology Group AALL0434 clinical trial. The cohort was carefully 
selected to capture the immunophenotypic diversity of T-ALL, with early T-cell 
precursor (ETP) and Near/Non-ETP subtypes represented, as well as enriched with 
both relapsed and treatment refractory cases. Integrated analyses of T-ALL 
blasts and normal T-cell precursors identified a bone-marrow progenitor-like 
(BMP-like) leukemia sub-population associated with treatment failure and poor 
overall survival. The single-cell-derived molecular signature of BMP-like blasts 
predicted poor outcome across multiple subtypes of T-ALL within two independent 
patient cohorts using bulk RNA-sequencing data from over 1300 patients. We 
defined the mutational landscape of BMP-like T-ALL, finding that NOTCH1 
mutations additively drive T-ALL blasts away from the BMP-like state. We 
transcriptionally matched BMP-like blasts to early thymic seeding progenitors 
that have low NR3C1 expression and high stem cell gene expression, corresponding 
to a corticosteroid and conventional cytotoxic resistant phenotype we observed 
in ex vivo drug screening. To identify novel targets for BMP-like blasts, we 
performed in silico and in vitro drug screening against the BMP-like signature 
and prioritized BMP-like overexpressed cell-surface (CD44, ITGA4, LGALS1) and 
intracellular proteins (BCL-2, MCL-1, BTK, NF-κB) as candidates for precision 
targeted therapy. We established patient derived xenograft models of BMP-high 
and BMP-low leukemias, which revealed vulnerability of BMP-like blasts to 
apoptosis-inducing agents, TEC-kinase inhibitors, and proteasome inhibitors. Our 
study establishes the first multi-omic signatures for rapid risk-stratification 
and targeted treatment of high-risk T-ALL.

The non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases gene family (PTPNs) is involved 
in the tumorigenesis and development of many cancers, but the role of PTPNs in 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. After a comprehensive evaluation 
on the expression patterns and immunological effects of PTPNs using a pan-cancer 
analysis based on RNA sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas, the 
most valuable gene PTPN2 was discovered. Further investigation of the expression 
patterns of PTPN2 in different tissues and cells showed a robust correlation 
with AML. PTPN2 was then systematically correlated with immunological signatures 
in the AML tumor microenvironment and its differential expression was verified 
using clinical samples. In addition, a prediction model, being validated and 
compared with other models, was developed in our research. The systematic 
analysis of PTPN family reveals that the effect of PTPNs on cancer may be 
correlated to mediating cell cycle-related pathways. It was then found that 
PTPN2 was highly expressed in hematologic diseases and bone marrow tissues, and 
its differential expression in AML patients and normal humans was verified by 
clinical samples. Based on its correlation with immune infiltrates, 
immunomodulators, and immune checkpoint, PTPN2 was found to be a reliable 
biomarker in the immunotherapy cohort and a prognostic predictor of AML. And 
PTPN2'riskscore can accurately predict the prognosis and response of cancer 
immunotherapy. These findings revealed the correlation between PTPNs and 
immunophenotype, which may be related to cell cycle. PTPN2 was differentially 
expressed between clinical AML patients and normal people. It is a diagnostic 
biomarker and potentially therapeutic target, providing targeted guidance for 
clinical treatment.

BACKGROUND: More than 200 asthma-associated genetic variants have been 
identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTL) data resources can help identify causal genes of the GWAS 
signals, but it can be difficult to find an eQTL that reflects the disease state 
because most eQTL data are obtained from normal healthy subjects.
METHODS: We performed a blood eQTL analysis using transcriptomic and genotypic 
data from 433 Korean asthma patients. To identify asthma-related genes, we 
carried out colocalization, Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) 
analysis, and Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) using the results of 
asthma GWASs and eQTL data. In addition, we compared the results of disease eQTL 
data and asthma-related genes with two normal blood eQTL data from 
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and a Japanese study.
RESULTS: We identified 340,274 cis-eQTL and 2,875 eGenes from asthmatic eQTL 
analysis. We compared the disease eQTL results with GTEx and a Japanese study 
and found that 64.1% of the 2,875 eGenes overlapped with the GTEx eGenes and 
39.0% with the Japanese eGenes. Following the integrated analysis of the 
asthmatic eQTL data with asthma GWASs, using colocalization and SMR methods, we 
identified 15 asthma-related genes specific to the Korean asthmatic eQTL data.
CONCLUSIONS: We provided Korean asthmatic cis-eQTL data and identified 
asthma-related genes by integrating them with GWAS data. In addition, we 
suggested these asthma-related genes as therapeutic targets for asthma. We 
envisage that our findings will contribute to understanding the etiological 
mechanisms of asthma and provide novel therapeutic targets.

The effects of genetic variation on complex traits act mainly through changes in 
gene regulation. Although many genetic variants have been linked to target genes 
in cis, the trans-regulatory cascade mediating their effects remains largely 
uncharacterized. Mapping trans-regulators based on natural genetic variation, 
including eQTL mapping, has been challenging due to small effects. Experimental 
perturbation approaches offer a complementary and powerful approach to mapping 
trans-regulators. We used CRISPR knockouts of 84 genes in primary CD4+ T cells 
to perturb an immune cell gene network, targeting both inborn error of immunity 
(IEI) disease transcription factors (TFs) and background TFs matched in 
constraint and expression level, but without a known immune disease association. 
We developed a novel Bayesian structure learning method called Linear Latent 
Causal Bayes (LLCB) to estimate the gene regulatory network from perturbation 
data and observed 211 directed edges among the genes which could not be detected 
in existing CD4+ trans-eQTL data. We used LLCB to characterize the differences 
between the IEI and background TFs, finding that the gene groups were highly 
interconnected, but that IEI TFs were much more likely to regulate immune cell 
specific pathways and immune GWAS genes. We further characterized nine coherent 
gene programs based on downstream effects of the TFs and linked these modules to 
regulation of GWAS genes, finding that canonical JAK-STAT family members are 
regulated by KMT2A, a global epigenetic regulator. These analyses reveal the 
trans-regulatory cascade from upstream epigenetic regulator to intermediate TFs 
to downstream effector cytokines and elucidate the logic linking immune GWAS 
genes to key signaling pathways.

Named entity recognition (NER) is a widely used text-mining and natural language 
processing (NLP) subtask. In recent years, deep learning methods have superseded 
traditional dictionary- and rule-based NER approaches. A high-quality dataset is 
essential to fully leverage recent deep learning advancements. While several 
gold-standard corpora for biomedical entities in abstracts exist, only a few are 
based on full-text research articles. The Europe PMC literature database 
routinely annotates Gene/Proteins, Diseases, and Organisms entities. To 
transition this pipeline from a dictionary-based to a machine learning-based 
approach, we have developed a human-annotated full-text corpus for these 
entities, comprising 300 full-text open-access research articles. Over 72,000 
mentions of biomedical concepts have been identified within approximately 
114,000 sentences. This article describes the corpus and details how to access 
and reuse this open community resource.

Multimorbidity represents an increasingly important public health challenge with 
far-reaching implications for health management and policy. Mental health and 
metabolic diseases have a well-established epidemiological association. In this 
study, we investigate the genetic intersection between type 2 diabetes and 
schizophrenia. We use Mendelian randomization to examine potential causal 
relationships between the two conditions and related endophenotypes. We report 
no compelling evidence that type 2 diabetes genetic liability potentially 
causally influences schizophrenia risk and vice versa. Our findings show that 
increased body mass index (BMI) has a protective effect against schizophrenia, 
in contrast to the well-known risk-increasing effect of BMI on type 2 diabetes 
risk. We identify evidence of colocalization of association signals for these 
two conditions at 11 genomic loci, six of which have opposing directions of 
effect for type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia. To elucidate these colocalizing 
signals, we integrate multi-omics data from bulk and single-cell gene expression 
studies, along with functional information. We identify high-confidence effector 
genes and find that they are enriched for homeostasis and lipid-related 
pathways. We also highlight drug repurposing opportunities including 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Our findings provide insights 
into shared biological mechanisms for type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia, 
highlighting common factors that influence the risk of the two conditions in 
opposite directions and shedding light on the complex nature of this 
comorbidity.

Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a common vasospastic disorder that causes severe 
pain and ulcers, but despite its high reported heritability, no causal genes 
have been robustly identified. We conducted a genome-wide association study 
including 5,147 RP cases and 439,294 controls, based on diagnoses from 
electronic health records, and identified three unreported genomic regions 
associated with the risk of RP (p < 5 × 10-8). We prioritized ADRA2A (rs7090046, 
odds ratio (OR) per allele: 1.26; 95%-CI: 1.20-1.31; p < 9.6 × 10-27) and IRX1 
(rs12653958, OR: 1.17; 95%-CI: 1.12-1.22, p < 4.8 × 10-13) as candidate causal 
genes through integration of gene expression in disease relevant tissues. We 
further identified a likely causal detrimental effect of low fasting glucose 
levels on RP risk (rG = -0.21; p-value = 2.3 × 10-3), and systematically 
highlighted drug repurposing opportunities, like the antidepressant mirtazapine. 
Our results provide the first robust evidence for a strong genetic contribution 
to RP and highlight a so far underrated role of α2A-adrenoreceptor signalling, 
encoded at ADRA2A, as a possible mechanism for hypersensitivity to 
catecholamine-induced vasospasms.

G protein-coupled receptors are important drug targets that engage and activate 
signaling transducers in multiple cellular compartments. Delineating therapeutic 
signaling from signaling associated with adverse events is an important step 
towards rational drug design. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a 
validated target for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, but drugs that 
target this receptor are a frequent cause of adverse events. Using recently 
developed biosensors, we explored the ability of GLP-1R to activate 15 pathways 
in 4 cellular compartments and demonstrate that modifications aimed at improving 
the therapeutic potential of GLP-1R agonists greatly influence compound 
efficacy, potency, and safety in a pathway- and compartment-selective manner. 
These findings, together with comparative structure analysis, time-lapse 
microscopy, and phosphoproteomics, reveal unique signaling signatures for GLP-1R 
agonists at the level of receptor conformation, functional selectivity, and 
location bias, thus associating signaling neighborhoods with functionally 
distinct cellular outcomes and clinical consequences.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin condition and prior 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 71 associated loci. In 
the current study we conducted the largest AD GWAS to date (discovery 
N = 1,086,394, replication N = 3,604,027), combining previously reported cohorts 
with additional available data. We identified 81 loci (29 novel) in the 
European-only analysis (which all replicated in a separate European analysis) 
and 10 additional loci in the multi-ancestry analysis (3 novel). Eight variants 
from the multi-ancestry analysis replicated in at least one of the populations 
tested (European, Latino or African), while two may be specific to individuals 
of Japanese ancestry. AD loci showed enrichment for DNAse I hypersensitivity and 
eQTL associations in blood. At each locus we prioritised candidate genes by 
integrating multi-omic data. The implicated genes are predominantly in immune 
pathways of relevance to atopic inflammation and some offer drug repurposing 
opportunities.

Male-pattern baldness (MPB) is related to dysregulation of androgens such as 
testosterone. A previously observed relationship between MPB and skin cancer may 
be due to greater exposure to ultraviolet radiation or indicate a role for 
androgenic pathways in the pathogenesis of skin cancers. We dissected this 
relationship via Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, using genetic data from 
recent male-only meta-analyses of cutaneous melanoma (12,232 cases; 20,566 
controls) and keratinocyte cancers (KCs) (up to 17,512 cases; >100,000 
controls), followed by stratified MR analysis by body-sites. We found strong 
associations between MPB and the risk of KC, but not with androgens, and 
multivariable models revealed that this relationship was heavily confounded by 
MPB single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in pigmentation pathways. 
Site-stratified MR analyses revealed strong associations between MPB with head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, suggesting that sun exposure on 
the scalp, rather than androgens, is the main driver. Men with less hair 
covering likely explains, at least in part, the higher incidence of melanoma in 
men residing in countries with high ambient UV.

The phenomenon of protein phase separation (PPS) underlies a wide range of 
cellular functions. Correspondingly, the dysregulation of the PPS process has 
been associated with numerous human diseases. To enable therapeutic 
interventions based on the regulation of this association, possible targets 
should be identified. For this purpose, we present an approach that combines the 
multiomic PandaOmics platform with the FuzDrop method to identify PPS-prone 
disease-associated proteins. Using this approach, we prioritize candidates with 
high PandaOmics and FuzDrop scores using a profiling method that accounts for a 
wide range of parameters relevant for disease mechanism and pharmacological 
intervention. We validate the differential phase separation behaviors of three 
predicted Alzheimer's disease targets (MARCKS, CAMKK2, and p62) in two cell 
models of this disease. Overall, the approach that we present generates a list 
of possible therapeutic targets for human diseases associated with the 
dysregulation of the PPS process.

Prospects for the discovery of robust and reproducible biomarkers have improved 
considerably with the development of sensitive omics platforms that can enable 
measurement of biological molecules at an unprecedented scale. With technical 
barriers to success lowering, the challenge is now moving into the analytical 
domain. Genome-wide discovery presents a problem of scale and multiple testing 
as standard statistical methods struggle to distinguish signal from noise in 
increasingly complex biological systems. Machine learning and AI methods are 
good at finding answers in large datasets, but they have a tendency to overfit 
solutions. It may be possible to find a local answer or mechanism in a specific 
patient sample or small group of samples, but this may not generalise to wider 
patient populations due to the high likelihood of false discovery. The rise of 
explainable AI offers to improve the opportunity for true discovery by providing 
explanations for predictions that can be explored mechanistically before 
proceeding to costly and time-consuming validation studies. This review aims to 
introduce some of the basic concepts of machine learning and AI for biomarker 
discovery with a focus on post hoc explanation of predictions. To illustrate 
this, we consider how explainable AI has already been used successfully, and we 
explore a case study that applies AI to biomarker discovery in rheumatoid 
arthritis, demonstrating the accessibility of tools for AI and machine learning. 
We use this to illustrate and discuss some of the potential challenges and 
solutions that may enable AI to critically interrogate disease and response 
mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Levodopa (L-DOPA) is considered the most reliable drug for treating 
Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical symptoms. Regrettably, long-term L-DOPA 
therapy results in the emergence of drug-induced abnormal involuntary movements 
(AIMs) in most PD patients. The mechanisms underlying motor fluctuations and 
dyskinesia induced by L-DOPA (LID) are still perplexing.
METHODS: Here, we first performed the analysis on the microarray data set 
(GSE55096) from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) repository and identified the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using linear models for microarray 
analysis (Limma) R packages from the Bioconductor project. 12 genes (Nr4a2, 
Areg, Tinf2, Ptgs2, Pdlim1, Tes, Irf6, Tgfb1, Serpinb2, Lipg, Creb3l1, Lypd1) 
were found to be upregulated. Six genes were validated on quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction and subsequently, Amphiregulin (Areg) was selected 
(based on log2 fold change) for further experiments to unravel its involvement 
in LID. Areg LV_shRNA was used to knock down Areg to explore its therapeutic 
role in the LID model.
RESULTS: Western blotting and immunofluorescence results show that AREG is 
significantly expressed in the LID group relative to the control. Dyskinetic 
movements in LID mice were alleviated by Areg knockdown, and the protein 
expression of delta FOSB, the commonly attributable protein in LID, was 
decreased. Moreover, Areg knockdown reduced the protein expression of P-ERK. In 
order to ascertain whether the inhibition of the ERK pathway (a common pathway 
known to mediate levodopa-induced dyskinesia) could also impede Areg, the 
animals were injected with an ERK inhibitor (PD98059). Afterward, the AIMs, 
AREG, and ERK protein expression were measured relative to the control group. A 
group treated with ERK inhibitor had a significant decrease of AREG and 
phosphorylated ERK protein expression relative to the control group.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicate unequivocal involvement of Areg 
in levodopa-induced dyskinesia, thus a target for therapy development.

BACKGROUND: Recent efforts to repurpose existing drugs to different indications 
have been accompanied by a number of computational methods, which incorporate 
protein-protein interaction networks and signaling pathways, to aid with 
prioritizing existing targets and/or drugs. However, many of these existing 
methods are focused on integrating additional data that are only available for a 
small subset of diseases or conditions.
METHODS: We have designed and implemented a new R-based open-source target 
prioritization and repurposing method that integrates both canonical 
intracellular signaling information from five public pathway databases and 
target information from public sources including OpenTargets.org. The 
Pathway2Targets algorithm takes a list of significant pathways as input, then 
retrieves and integrates public data for all targets within those pathways for a 
given condition. It also incorporates a weighting scheme that is customizable by 
the user to support a variety of use cases including target prioritization, drug 
repurposing, and identifying novel targets that are biologically relevant for a 
different indication.
RESULTS: As a proof of concept, we applied this algorithm to a public colorectal 
cancer RNA-sequencing dataset with 144 case and control samples. Our analysis 
identified 430 targets and ~700 unique drugs based on differential gene 
expression and signaling pathway enrichment. We found that our highest-ranked 
predicted targets were significantly enriched in targets with FDA-approved 
therapeutics for colorectal cancer (p-value < 0.025) that included EGFR, VEGFA, 
and PTGS2. Interestingly, there was no statistically significant enrichment of 
targets for other cancers in this same list suggesting high specificity of the 
results. We also adjusted the weighting scheme to prioritize more novel targets 
for CRC. This second analysis revealed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), 
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and two mitogen-activated protein kinases 
(MAPK14 and MAPK3). These observations suggest that our open-source method with 
a customizable weighting scheme can accurately prioritize targets that are 
specific and relevant to the disease or condition of interest, as well as 
targets that are at earlier stages of development. We anticipate that this 
method will complement other approaches to repurpose drugs for a variety of 
indications, which can contribute to the improvement of the quality of life and 
overall health of such patients.

OBJECTIVE: To scope the potential for (semi)-automated triangulation of 
Mendelian randomisation (MR) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evidence 
since the two methods have distinct assumptions that make comparisons between 
their results invaluable.
METHODS: We mined ClinicalTrials.Gov, PubMed and EpigraphDB databases and 
carried out a series of 26 manual literature comparisons among 54 MR and 77 RCT 
publications.
RESULTS: We found that only 13% of completed RCTs identified in 
ClinicalTrials.Gov submitted their results to the database. Similarly low 
coverage was revealed for Semantic Medline (SemMedDB) semantic triples derived 
from MR and RCT publications -36% and 12%, respectively. Among intervention 
types that can be mimicked by MR, only trials of pharmaceutical interventions 
could be automatically matched to MR results due to insufficient annotation with 
Medical Subject Headings ontology. A manual survey of the literature highlighted 
the potential for triangulation across a number of exposure/outcome pairs if 
these challenges can be addressed.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that careful triangulation of MR with RCT evidence 
should involve consideration of similarity of phenotypes across study designs, 
intervention intensity and duration, study population demography and health 
status, comparator group, intervention goal and quality of evidence.

Advancing age is the greatest risk factor for developing multiple age-related 
diseases. Therapeutic approaches targeting the underlying pathways of ageing, 
rather than individual diseases, may be an effective way to treat and prevent 
age-related morbidity while reducing the burden of polypharmacy. We harness the 
Open Targets Genetics Portal to perform a systematic analysis of nearly 1,400 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) mapped to 34 age-related diseases and 
traits, identifying genetic signals that are shared between two or more of these 
traits. Using locus-to-gene (L2G) mapping, we identify 995 targets with shared 
genetic links to age-related diseases and traits, which are enriched in 
mechanisms of ageing and include known ageing and longevity-related genes. Of 
these 995 genes, 128 are the target of an approved or investigational drug, 526 
have experimental evidence of binding pockets or are predicted to be tractable, 
and 341 have no existing tractability evidence, representing underexplored genes 
which may reveal novel biological insights and therapeutic opportunities. We 
present these candidate targets for exploration and prioritisation in a web 
application.

Drug targets with genetic support are several-fold more likely to succeed in 
clinical trials. We introduce a genetic-driven approach based on causal 
inferences that can inform drug target prioritization, repurposing, and adverse 
effects of using lipid-lowering agents. Given that a multi-trait approach 
increases the power to detect meaningful variants/genes, we conduct multi-omics 
and multi-trait analyses, followed by network connectivity investigations, and 
prioritize 30 potential therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia, including SORT1, 
PSRC1, CELSR2, PCSK9, HMGCR, APOB, GRN, HFE2, FJX1, C1QTNF1, and SLC5A8. 20% 
(6/30) of prioritized targets from our hypothesis-free drug target search are 
either approved or under investigation for dyslipidemia. The prioritized targets 
are 22-fold higher in likelihood of being approved or under investigation in 
clinical trials than genome-wide association study (GWAS)-curated targets. Our 
results demonstrate that the genetic-driven approach used in this study is a 
promising strategy for prioritizing targets while informing about the potential 
adverse effects and repurposing opportunities.

OBJECTIVE: Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders such as global 
developmental delay (GDD) present both genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. 
This diversity has hampered developing of targeted interventions given the 
relative rarity of each individual genetic etiology. Novel approaches to 
clinical trials where distinct, but related diseases can be treated by a common 
drug, known as basket trials, which have shown benefits in oncology but have yet 
to be used in GDD. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how individuals with GDD 
could be clustered. Here, we assess two different approaches: agglomerative and 
divisive clustering.
METHODS: Using the largest cohort of individuals with GDD, which is the 
Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD), characterized using a systematic 
approach, we extracted genotypic and phenotypic information from 6,588 
individuals with GDD. We then used a k-means clustering (divisive) and 
hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) to identify subgroups of 
individuals. Next, we extracted gene network and molecular function information 
with regard to the clusters identified by each approach.
RESULTS: HAC based on phenotypes identified in individuals with GDD revealed 16 
clusters, each presenting with one dominant phenotype displayed by most 
individuals in the cluster, along with other minor phenotypes. Among the most 
common phenotypes reported were delayed speech, absent speech, and seizure. 
Interestingly, each phenotypic cluster molecularly included several (3-12) gene 
sub-networks of more closely related genes with diverse molecular function. 
k-means clustering also segregated individuals harboring those phenotypes, but 
the genetic pathways identified were different from the ones identified from 
HAC.
CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates how divisive (k-means) and agglomerative 
clustering can be used in order to group individuals with GDD for future basket 
trials. Moreover, the result of our analysis suggests that phenotypic clusters 
should be subdivided into molecular sub-networks for an increased likelihood of 
successful treatment. Finally, a combination of both agglomerative and divisive 
clustering may be required for developing of a comprehensive treatment.

Adverse drug events constitute a major challenge for the success of clinical 
trials. Several computational strategies have been suggested to estimate the 
risk of adverse drug events in preclinical drug development. While these 
approaches have demonstrated high utility in practice, they are at the same time 
limited to specific information sources. Thus, many current computational 
approaches neglect a wealth of information which results from the integration of 
different data sources, such as biological protein function, gene expression, 
chemical compound structure, cell-based imaging and others. In this work we 
propose an integrative and explainable multi-modal Graph Machine Learning 
approach (MultiGML), which fuses knowledge graphs with multiple further data 
modalities to predict drug related adverse events and general drug 
target-phenotype associations. MultiGML demonstrates excellent prediction 
performance compared to alternative algorithms, including various traditional 
knowledge graph embedding techniques. MultiGML distinguishes itself from 
alternative techniques by providing in-depth explanations of model predictions, 
which point towards biological mechanisms associated with predictions of an 
adverse drug event. Hence, MultiGML could be a versatile tool to support 
decision making in preclinical drug development.

Circulating proteins have important functions in inflammation and a broad range 
of diseases. To identify genetic influences on inflammation-related proteins, we 
conducted a genome-wide protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) study of 91 
plasma proteins measured using the Olink Target platform in 14,824 participants. 
We identified 180 pQTLs (59 cis, 121 trans). Integration of pQTL data with eQTL 
and disease genome-wide association studies provided insight into pathogenesis, 
implicating lymphotoxin-α in multiple sclerosis. Using Mendelian randomization 
(MR) to assess causality in disease etiology, we identified both shared and 
distinct effects of specific proteins across immune-mediated diseases, including 
directionally discordant effects of CD40 on risk of rheumatoid arthritis versus 
multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. MR implicated CXCL5 in the 
etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) and we show elevated gut CXCL5 transcript 
expression in patients with UC. These results identify targets of existing drugs 
and provide a powerful resource to facilitate future drug target prioritization.

The majority of compounds designed against cancer drug targets do not progress 
to become approved drugs, mainly due to lack of efficacy and/or unmanageable 
toxicity. Robust target evaluation is therefore required before progressing 
through the drug discovery process to reduce the high attrition rate. There are 
a wealth of publicly available databases that can be mined to generate data as 
part of a target evaluation. It can, however, be challenging to learn what 
databases are available, how and when they should be used, and to understand the 
associated limitations. Here, we have compiled and present key, freely 
accessible and easy-to-use databases that house informative datasets from in 
vitro, in vivo and clinical studies. We also highlight comprehensive target 
review databases that aim to bring together information from multiple sources 
into one-stop portals. In the post-genomics era, a key objective is to exploit 
the extensive cell, animal and patient characterization datasets in order to 
deliver precision medicine on a patient-specific basis. Effective utilization of 
the highlighted databases will go some way towards supporting the cancer 
research community achieve these aims.

Existing phenotype ontologies were originally developed to represent phenotypes 
that manifest as a character state in relation to a wild-type or other 
reference. However, these do not include the phenotypic trait or attribute 
categories required for the annotation of genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS), Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mappings or any population-focussed 
measurable trait data. The integration of trait and biological attribute 
information with an ever increasing body of chemical, environmental and 
biological data greatly facilitates computational analyses and it is also highly 
relevant to biomedical and clinical applications. The Ontology of Biological 
Attributes (OBA) is a formalised, species-independent collection of 
interoperable phenotypic trait categories that is intended to fulfil a data 
integration role. OBA is a standardised representational framework for 
observable attributes that are characteristics of biological entities, 
organisms, or parts of organisms. OBA has a modular design which provides 
several benefits for users and data integrators, including an automated and 
meaningful classification of trait terms computed on the basis of logical 
inferences drawn from domain-specific ontologies for cells, anatomical and other 
relevant entities. The logical axioms in OBA also provide a previously missing 
bridge that can computationally link Mendelian phenotypes with GWAS and 
quantitative traits. The term components in OBA provide semantic links and 
enable knowledge and data integration across specialised research community 
boundaries, thereby breaking silos.

Protein coding genes exhibit different degrees of intolerance to 
loss-of-function variation. The most intolerant genes, whose function is 
essential for cell or/and organism survival, inform on fundamental biological 
processes related to cell proliferation and organism development and provide a 
window on the molecular mechanisms of human disease. Here we present a brief 
overview of the resources and knowledge gathered around gene essentiality, from 
cancer cell lines to model organisms to human development. We outline the 
implications of using different sources of evidence and definitions to determine 
which genes are essential and highlight how information on the essentiality 
status of a gene can inform novel disease gene discovery and therapeutic target 
identification.

BACKGROUND: Experimental studies suggest that exposures may impact respiratory 
health across generations via epigenetic changes transmitted specifically 
through male germ cells. Studies in humans are, however, limited. We aim to 
identify epigenetic marks in offspring associated with father's preconception 
smoking.
METHODS: We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in the RHINESSA 
cohort (7-50 years) on father's any preconception smoking (n = 875 offspring) 
and father's pubertal onset smoking < 15 years (n = 304), using Infinium 
MethylationEPIC Beadchip arrays, adjusting for offspring age, own smoking and 
maternal smoking. EWAS of maternal and offspring personal smoking were performed 
for comparison. Father's smoking-associated dmCpGs were checked in 
subpopulations of offspring who reported no personal smoking and no maternal 
smoking exposure.
RESULTS: Father's smoking commencing preconception was associated with 
methylation of blood DNA in offspring at two cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites 
(CpGs) (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) in PRR5 and CENPP. Father's pubertal 
onset smoking was associated with 19 CpGs (FDR < 0.05) mapped to 14 genes (TLR9, 
DNTT, FAM53B, NCAPG2, PSTPIP2, MBIP, C2orf39, NTRK2, DNAJC14, CDO1, PRAP1, 
TPCN1, IRS1 and CSF1R). These differentially methylated sites were 
hypermethylated and associated with promoter regions capable of gene silencing. 
Some of these sites were associated with offspring outcomes in this cohort 
including ever-asthma (NTRK2), ever-wheezing (DNAJC14, TPCN1), weight (FAM53B, 
NTRK2) and BMI (FAM53B, NTRK2) (p < 0.05). Pathway analysis showed enrichment 
for gene ontology pathways including regulation of gene expression, inflammation 
and innate immune responses. Father's smoking-associated sites did not overlap 
with dmCpGs identified in EWAS of personal and maternal smoking (FDR < 0.05), 
and all sites remained significant (p < 0.05) in analyses of offspring with no 
personal smoking and no maternal smoking exposure.
CONCLUSION: Father's preconception smoking, particularly in puberty, is 
associated with offspring DNA methylation, providing evidence that epigenetic 
mechanisms may underlie epidemiological observations that pubertal paternal 
smoking increases risk of offspring asthma, low lung function and obesity.

Circadian rhythms (CRs) are fundamental biological processes that significantly 
impact human well-being. Disruption of these rhythms can trigger insufficient 
neurocognitive development, insomnia, mental disorders, cardiovascular diseases, 
metabolic dysfunctions, and cancer. The field of chronobiology has increased our 
understanding of how rhythm disturbances contribute to cancer pathogenesis, and 
how circadian timing influences the efficacy of cancer treatments. As the 
circadian clock steadily gains recognition as an emerging factor in 
tumorigenesis, a thorough and comprehensive multi-omics analysis of CR 
genes/proteins has never been performed. To shed light on this, we performed, 
for the first time, an integrated data analysis encompassing 
genomic/transcriptomic alterations across 32 cancer types (n = 10,918 tumors) 
taken from the PanCancer Atlas, unfavorable prognostic protein analysis, 
protein-protein interactomics, and shortest distance score pathways to cancer 
hallmark phenotypes. This data mining strategy allowed us to unravel 31 
essential CR-related proteins involved in the signaling crossroad between 
circadian rhythms and cancer. In the context of drugging the clock, we 
identified pharmacogenomic clinical annotations and drugs currently in late 
phase clinical trials that could be considered as potential cancer therapeutic 
strategies. These findings highlight the diverse roles of CR-related 
genes/proteins in the realm of cancer research and therapy.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a poor prognosis and 
is one of the deadliest gastrointestinal malignancies. Despite numerous 
transcriptomics studies to understand its molecular basis, the impact of 
population-specific differences on this disease remains unexplored.
AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the population-specific differences in 
gene expression patterns among ESCC samples obtained from six distinct global 
populations, identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their associated 
pathways, and identify potential biomarkers for ESCC diagnosis and prognosis. In 
addition, this study deciphers population specific microbial and chemical risk 
factors in ESCC.
METHODS: We compared the gene expression patterns of ESCC samples from six 
different global populations by analyzing microarray datasets. To identify DEGs, 
we conducted stringent quality control and employed linear modeling. We 
cross-compared the resulting DEG lists of each populations along with ESCC ATLAS 
to identify known and novel DEGs. We performed a survival analysis using The 
Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) data to identify potential biomarkers for 
ESCC diagnosis and prognosis among the novel DEGs. Finally, we performed 
comparative functional enrichment and toxicogenomic analysis.
RESULTS: Here we report 19 genes with distinct expression patterns among 
populations, indicating population-specific variations in ESCC. Additionally, we 
discovered 166 novel DEGs, such as ENDOU, SLCO1B3, KCNS3, IFI35, among others. 
The survival analysis identified three novel genes (CHRM3, CREG2, H2AC6) 
critical for ESCC survival. Notably, our findings showed that ECM-related gene 
ontology terms and pathways were significantly enriched among the DEGs in ESCC. 
We also found population-specific variations in immune response and microbial 
infection-related pathways which included genes enriched for HPV, Ameobiosis, 
Leishmaniosis, and Human Cytomegaloviruses. Our toxicogenomic analysis 
identified tobacco smoking as the primary risk factor and cisplatin as the main 
drug chemical interacting with the maximum number of DEGs across populations.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into population-specific 
differences in gene expression patterns and their associated pathways in ESCC. 
Our findings suggest that changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization may 
be crucial to the development and progression of this cancer, and that 
environmental and genetic factors play important roles in the disease. The novel 
DEGs identified may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and 
treatment.

Novel biomarkers are key to addressing the ongoing pandemic of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. While new technologies have improved the potential of identifying such 
biomarkers, at the same time there is an increasing need for informed 
prioritization to ensure efficient downstream verification. We have built BALDR, 
an automated pipeline for biomarker comparison and prioritization in the context 
of diabetes. BALDR includes protein, gene, and disease data from major public 
repositories, text-mining data, and human and mouse experimental data from the 
IMI2 RHAPSODY consortium. These data are provided as easy-to-read figures and 
tables enabling direct comparison of up to 20 biomarker candidates for diabetes 
through the public website https://baldr.cpr.ku.dk.

OBJECTIVE: Gain a better understanding of sex-specific differences in 
individuals with global developmental delay (GDD), with a focus on phenotypes 
and genotypes.
METHODS: Using the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) dataset, we 
extracted phenotypic information from 6,588 individuals with GDD and then 
identified statistically significant variations in phenotypes and genotypes 
based on sex. We compared genes with pathogenic variants between sex and then 
performed gene network and molecular function enrichment analysis and gene 
expression profiling between sex. Finally, we contrasted individuals with autism 
as an associated condition.
RESULTS: We identified significantly differentially expressed phenotypes in 
males vs. females individuals with GDD. Autism and macrocephaly were 
significantly more common in males whereas microcephaly and stereotypies were 
more common in females. Importantly, 66% of GDD genes with pathogenic variants 
overlapped between both sexes. In the cohort, males presented with only slightly 
increased X-linked genes (9% vs. 8%, respectively). Individuals from both sexes 
harbored a similar number of pathogenic variants overall (3) but females 
presented with a significantly higher load for GDD genes with high intolerance 
to loss of function. Sex difference in gene expression correlated with genes 
identified in a sex specific manner. While we identified sex-specific GDD gene 
mutations, their pathways overlapped. Interestingly, individuals with GDD but 
also co-morbid autism phenotypes, we observed distinct mutation load, pathways 
and phenotypic presentation.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows for the first time that males and females with GDD 
present with significantly different phenotypes. Moreover, while most GDD genes 
overlapped, some genes were found uniquely in each sex. Surprisingly they shared 
similar molecular functions. Sorting genes by predicted tolerance to loss of 
function (pLI) led to identifying an increased mutation load in females with 
GDD, suggesting potentially a tolerance to GDD genes of higher pLI compared to 
overall GDD genes. Finally, we show that considering associated conditions (for 
instance autism) may influence the genomic underpinning found in individuals 
with GDD and highlight the importance of comprehensive phenotyping.

The AAA+ ATPase valosin containing protein (VCP) is essential for cell and organ 
homeostasis, especially in cells of the nervous system. As part of a large 
network, VCP collaborates with many cofactors to ensure proteostasis under 
normal, stress, and disease conditions. A large number of mutations have 
revealed the importance of VCP for human health. In particular, VCP facilitates 
the dismantling of protein aggregates and the removal of dysfunctional 
organelles. These are critical events to prevent malfunction of the brain and 
other parts of the nervous system. In line with this idea, VCP mutants are 
linked to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration and other diseases. The 
intricate molecular mechanisms that connect VCP mutations to distinct brain 
pathologies continue to be uncovered. Emerging evidence supports the model that 
VCP controls cellular functions on multiple levels and in a cell type specific 
fashion. Accordingly, VCP mutants derail cellular homeostasis through several 
mechanisms that can instigate disease. Our review focuses on the association 
between VCP malfunction and neurodegeneration. We discuss the latest insights in 
the field, emphasize open questions, and speculate on the potential of VCP as a 
drug target for some of the most devastating forms of neurodegeneration.

BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often co-occurs with psychiatric and 
gastrointestinal disorders. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
identified several genetic risk variants for IBS. However, most of the 
heritability remains unidentified, and the genetic overlap with psychiatric and 
somatic disorders is not quantified beyond genome-wide genetic correlations. 
Here, we characterize the genetic architecture of IBS, further, investigate its 
genetic overlap with psychiatric and gastrointestinal phenotypes, and identify 
novel genomic risk loci.
METHODS: Using GWAS summary statistics of IBS (53,400 cases and 433,201 
controls), and psychiatric and gastrointestinal phenotypes, we performed 
bivariate casual mixture model analysis to characterize the genetic architecture 
and genetic overlap between these phenotypes. We leveraged identified genetic 
overlap to boost the discovery of genomic loci associated with IBS, and to 
identify specific shared loci associated with both IBS and psychiatric and 
gastrointestinal phenotypes, using the conditional/conjunctional false discovery 
rate (condFDR/conjFDR) framework. We used functional mapping and gene annotation 
(FUMA) for functional analyses.
RESULTS: IBS was highly polygenic with 12k trait-influencing variants. We found 
extensive polygenic overlap between IBS and psychiatric disorders and to a 
lesser extent with gastrointestinal diseases. We identified 132 independent 
IBS-associated loci (condFDR < 0.05) by conditioning on psychiatric disorders 
(n = 127) and gastrointestinal diseases (n = 24). Using conjFDR, 70 unique loci 
were shared between IBS and psychiatric disorders. Functional analyses of shared 
loci revealed enrichment for biological pathways of the nervous and immune 
systems. Genetic correlations and shared loci between psychiatric disorders and 
IBS subtypes were different.
CONCLUSIONS: We found extensive polygenic overlap of IBS and psychiatric and 
gastrointestinal phenotypes beyond what was revealed with genetic correlations. 
Leveraging the overlap, we discovered genetic loci associated with IBS which 
implicate a wide range of biological pathways beyond the gut-brain axis. Genetic 
differences may underlie the clinical subtype of IBS. These results increase our 
understanding of the pathophysiology of IBS which may form the basis for the 
development of individualized interventions.

MOTIVATION: Open Target Genetics is a comprehensive resource portal that offers 
variant-centric statistical evidence, enabling the prioritization of causal 
variants and the identification of potential drug targets. The portal uses 
GraphQL technology for efficient data query and provides endpoints for 
programmatic access for R and Python users. However, leveraging GraphQL for data 
retrieval can be challenging, time-consuming, and repetitive, requiring 
familiarity with the GraphQL query language and processing outputs in nested 
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format into tidy data tables. Therefore, 
developing open-source tools are required to simplify data retrieval processes 
to integrate valuable genetic information into data-driven target discovery 
pipelines seamlessly.
RESULTS: otargen is an open-source R package designed to make data retrieval and 
analysis from the Open Target Genetics portal as simple as possible for R users. 
The package offers a suite of functions covering all query types, allowing 
streamlined data access in a tidy table format. By executing only a single line 
of code, the otargen users avoid the repetitive scripting of complex GraphQL 
queries, including the post-processing steps. In addition, otargen contains 
convenient plotting functions to visualize and gain insights from complex data 
tables returned by several key functions.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: otargen is available at

Designing a targeted screening library of bioactive small molecules is a 
challenging task since most compounds modulate their effects through multiple 
protein targets with varying degrees of potency and selectivity. We implemented 
analytic procedures for designing anticancer compound libraries adjusted for 
library size, cellular activity, chemical diversity and availability, and target 
selectivity. The resulting compound collections cover a wide range of protein 
targets and biological pathways implicated in various cancers, making them 
widely applicable to precision oncology. We characterized the compound and 
target spaces of the virtual libraries, in comparison with a minimal screening 
library of 1,211 compounds for targeting 1,386 anticancer proteins. In a pilot 
screening study, we identified patient-specific vulnerabilities by imaging 
glioma stem cells from patients with glioblastoma (GBM), using a physical 
library of 789 compounds that cover 1,320 of the anticancer targets. The cell 
survival profiling revealed highly heterogeneous phenotypic responses across the 
patients and GBM subtypes.

The identification of human proteins that are amenable to pharmacologic 
modulation without significant off-target effects remains an important unsolved 
challenge. Computational methods have been devised to identify features which 
distinguish between "druggable" and "undruggable" proteins, finding that protein 
sequence, tissue and cellular localization, biological role, and position in the 
protein-protein interaction network are all important discriminant factors. 
However, many prior efforts to automate the assessment of protein druggability 
suffer from low performance or poor interpretability. We developed a neural 
network-based machine learning model capable of generating druggability 
sub-scores based on each of four distinct categories, combining them to form an 
overall druggability score. The model achieves an excellent performance in 
separating drugged and undrugged proteins in the human proteome, with an area 
under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.95. Our use of multiple 
sub-scores allows the assessment of potential protein targets of interest based 
on distinct contributors to druggability, leading to a more interpretable and 
holistic model to identify novel targets.

Protein structural domains have been less studied than full-length proteins in 
terms of ontology annotations. The dcGO database has filled this gap by 
providing mappings from protein domains to ontologies. The dcGO update in 2023 
extends annotations for protein domains of multiple definitions (SCOP, Pfam, and 
InterPro) with commonly used ontologies that are categorised into functions, 
phenotypes, diseases, drugs, pathways, regulators, and hallmarks. This update 
adds new dimensions to the utility of both ontology and protein domain 
resources. A newly designed website at http://www.protdomainonto.pro/dcGO offers 
a more centralised and user-friendly way to access the dcGO database, with 
enhanced faceted search returning term- and domain-specific information pages. 
Users can navigate both ontology terms and annotated domains through improved 
ontology hierarchy browsing. A newly added facility enables domain-based 
ontology enrichment analysis.

Treatments for neurodegenerative disorders remain rare, although recent FDA 
approvals, such as Lecanemab and Aducanumab for Alzheimer's Disease, highlight 
the importance of the underlying biological mechanisms in driving discovery and 
creating disease modifying therapies. The global population is aging, driving an 
urgent need for therapeutics that stop disease progression and eliminate 
symptoms. In this study, we create an open framework and resource for 
evidence-based identification of therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative 
disease. We use Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization to identify genetic 
targets for drug discovery and repurposing. In parallel, we provide mechanistic 
insights into disease processes and potential network-level consequences of 
gene-based therapeutics. We identify 116 Alzheimer's disease, 3 amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, 5 Lewy body dementia, 46 Parkinson's disease, and 9 
Progressive supranuclear palsy target genes passing multiple test corrections 
(pSMR_multi < 2.95×10-6 and pHEIDI > 0.01). We created a therapeutic scheme to 
classify our identified target genes into strata based on druggability and 
approved therapeutics - classifying 41 novel targets, 3 known targets, and 115 
difficult targets (of these 69.8% are expressed in the disease relevant cell 
type from single nucleus experiments). Our novel class of genes provides a 
springboard for new opportunities in drug discovery, development and repurposing 
in the pre-competitive space. In addition, looking at drug-gene interaction 
networks, we identify previous trials that may require further follow-up such as 
Riluzole in AD. We also provide a user-friendly web platform to help users 
explore potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases, decreasing 
activation energy for the community

Introduction: Investigation of molecular mechanisms of human disorders, 
especially rare diseases, require exploration of various knowledge repositories 
for building precise hypotheses and complex data interpretation. Recently, 
increasingly more resources offer diagrammatic representation of such 
mechanisms, including disease-dedicated schematics in pathway databases and 
disease maps. However, collection of knowledge across them is challenging, 
especially for research projects with limited manpower. Methods: In this article 
we present an automated workflow for construction of maps of molecular 
mechanisms for rare diseases. The workflow requires a standardized definition of 
a disease using Orphanet or HPO identifiers to collect relevant genes and 
variants, and to assemble a functional, visual repository of related mechanisms, 
including data overlays. The diagrams composing the final map are unified to a 
common systems biology format from CellDesigner SBML, GPML and 
SBML+layout+render. The constructed resource contains disease-relevant genes and 
variants as data overlays for immediate visual exploration, including embedded 
genetic variant browser and protein structure viewer. Results: We demonstrate 
the functionality of our workflow on two examples of rare diseases: Kawasaki 
disease and retinitis pigmentosa. Two maps are constructed based on their 
corresponding identifiers. Moreover, for the retinitis pigmentosa use-case, we 
include a list of differentially expressed genes to demonstrate how to tailor 
the workflow using omics datasets. Discussion: In summary, our work allows for 
an ad-hoc construction of molecular diagrams combined from different sources, 
preserving their layout and graphical style, but integrating them into a single 
resource. This allows to reduce time consuming tasks of prototyping of a 
molecular disease map, enabling visual exploration, hypothesis building, data 
visualization and further refinement. The code of the workflow is open and 
accessible at https://gitlab.lcsb.uni.lu/minerva/automap/.

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of diverticular 
disease (DivD) of intestine within 724,372 individuals and identified 150 
independent genome-wide significant DNA variants. Integration of the GWAS 
results with human gut single-cell RNA sequencing data implicated gut myocyte, 
mesothelial and stromal cells, and enteric neurons and glia in DivD development. 
Ninety-five genes were prioritized based on multiple lines of evidence, 
including SLC9A3, a drug target gene of tenapanor used for the treatment of the 
constipation subtype of irritable bowel syndrome. A DivD polygenic score (PGS) 
enables effective risk prediction (area under the curve [AUC], 0.688; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.645-0.732) and the top 20% PGS was associated with 
∼3.6-fold increased DivD risk relative to the remaining population. Our 
statistical and bioinformatic analyses suggest that the mechanism of DivD is 
through colon structure, gut motility, gastrointestinal mucus, and ionic 
homeostasis. Our analyses reinforce the link between gastrointestinal disorders 
and the enteric nervous system through genetics.

We conduct a large-scale meta-analysis of heart failure genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) consisting of over 90,000 heart failure cases and more than 1 
million control individuals of European ancestry to uncover novel genetic 
determinants for heart failure. Using the GWAS results and blood protein 
quantitative loci, we perform Mendelian randomization and colocalization 
analyses on human proteins to provide putative causal evidence for the role of 
druggable proteins in the genesis of heart failure. We identify 39 genome-wide 
significant heart failure risk variants, of which 18 are previously unreported. 
Using a combination of Mendelian randomization proteomics and genetic cis-only 
colocalization analyses, we identify 10 additional putatively causal genes for 
heart failure. Findings from GWAS and Mendelian randomization-proteomics 
identify seven (CAMK2D, PRKD1, PRKD3, MAPK3, TNFSF12, APOC3 and NAE1) proteins 
as potential targets for interventions to be used in primary prevention of heart 
failure.

The expression of the placental growth factor (PGF) in cancer cells and the 
tumor microenvironment can contribute to the induction of angiogenesis, 
supporting cancer cell metabolism by ensuring an adequate blood supply. 
Angiogenesis is a key component of cancer metabolism as it facilitates the 
delivery of nutrients and oxygen to rapidly growing tumor cells. PGF is 
recognized as a novel target for anti-cancer treatment due to its ability to 
overcome resistance to existing angiogenesis inhibitors and its impact on the 
tumor microenvironment. We aimed to integrate bioinformatics evidence using 
various data sources and analytic tools for target-indication identification of 
the PGF target and prioritize the indication across various cancer types as an 
initial step of drug development. The data analysis included PGF gene function, 
molecular pathway, protein interaction, gene expression and mutation across 
cancer type, survival prognosis and tumor immune infiltration association with 
PGF. The overall evaluation was conducted given the totality of evidence, to 
target the PGF gene to treat the cancer where the PGF level was highly expressed 
in a certain tumor type with poor survival prognosis as well as possibly 
associated with poor tumor infiltration level. PGF showed a significant impact 
on overall survival in several cancers through univariate or multivariate 
survival analysis. The cancers considered as target diseases for PGF inhibitors, 
due to their potential effects on PGF, are adrenocortical carcinoma, kidney 
cancers, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and uveal 
melanoma.

BACKGROUND: Due to the asymptomatic nature of the early stages, chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) is usually diagnosed at late stages and lacks targeted therapy, 
highlighting the need for new biomarkers to better understand its 
pathophysiology and to be used for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets. 
Given the close relationship between CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD), we 
investigated the associations of 233 CVD- and inflammation-related plasma 
proteins with kidney function decline and aimed to assess whether the observed 
associations are causal.
METHODS: We included 1140 participants, aged 55-74 years at baseline, from the 
Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) cohort study, with 
a median follow-up time of 13.4 years and 2 follow-up visits. We measured 233 
plasma proteins using a proximity extension assay at baseline. In the discovery 
analysis, linear regression models were used to estimate the associations of 233 
proteins with the annual rate of change in creatinine-based estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFRcr). We further investigated the association of 
eGFRcr-associated proteins with the annual rate of change in cystatin C-based 
eGFR (eGFRcys) and eGFRcr-based incident CKD. Two-sample Mendelian randomization 
was used to infer causality.
RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, 66 out of 233 proteins were inversely 
associated with the annual rate of change in eGFRcr, indicating that higher 
baseline protein levels were associated with faster eGFRcr decline. Among these 
66 proteins, 21 proteins were associated with both the annual rate of change in 
eGFRcys and incident CKD. Mendelian randomization analyses on these 21 proteins 
suggest a potential causal association of higher tumor necrosis factor receptor 
superfamily member 11A (TNFRSF11A) level with eGFR decline.
CONCLUSIONS: We reported 21 proteins associated with kidney function decline and 
incident CKD and provided preliminary evidence suggesting a potential causal 
association between TNFRSF11A and kidney function decline. Further Mendelian 
randomization studies are needed to establish a conclusive causal association.

How to effectively convert genomic summary data into downstream knowledge 
discovery represents a major challenge in human genomics research. To address 
this challenge, we have developed efficient and effective approaches and tools. 
Extending our previously established software tools, we here introduce OpenXGR 
(http://www.openxgr.com), a newly designed web server that offers almost 
real-time enrichment and subnetwork analyses for a user-input list of genes, 
SNPs or genomic regions. It achieves so through leveraging ontologies, networks, 
and functional genomic datasets (such as promoter capture Hi-C, e/pQTL and 
enhancer-gene maps for linking SNPs or genomic regions to candidate genes). Six 
analysers are provided, each doing specific interpretations tailored to genomic 
summary data at various levels. Three enrichment analysers are designed to 
identify ontology terms enriched for input genes, as well as genes linked from 
input SNPs or genomic regions. Three subnetwork analysers allow users to 
identify gene subnetworks from input gene-, SNP- or genomic region-level summary 
data. With a step-by-step user manual, OpenXGR provides a user-friendly and 
all-in-one platform for interpreting summary data on the human genome, enabling 
more integrated and effective knowledge discovery.

Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, is a highly heritable human 
disease. Previous genome-wide association studies have identified over 100 loci 
for the most common form, primary open-angle glaucoma. Two key 
glaucoma-associated traits also show high heritability: intraocular pressure and 
optic nerve head excavation damage quantified as the vertical cup-to-disc ratio. 
Here, since much of glaucoma heritability remains unexplained, we conducted a 
large-scale multitrait genome-wide association study in participants of European 
ancestry combining primary open-angle glaucoma and its two associated traits 
(total sample size over 600,000) to substantially improve genetic discovery 
power (263 loci). We further increased our power by then employing a 
multiancestry approach, which increased the number of independent risk loci to 
312, with the vast majority replicating in a large independent cohort from 
23andMe, Inc. (total sample size over 2.8 million; 296 loci replicated at 
P < 0.05, 240 after Bonferroni correction). Leveraging multiomics datasets, we 
identified many potential druggable genes, including neuro-protection targets 
likely to act via the optic nerve, a key advance for glaucoma because all 
existing drugs only target intraocular pressure. We further used Mendelian 
randomization and genetic correlation-based approaches to identify novel links 
to other complex traits, including immune-related diseases such as multiple 
sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a progressive form of kidney disease defined by 
glomerular deposition of IgA. Here we performed a genome-wide association study 
of 10,146 kidney-biopsy-diagnosed IgAN cases and 28,751 controls across 17 
international cohorts. We defined 30 genome-wide significant risk loci 
explaining 11% of disease risk. A total of 16 loci were new, including 
TNFSF4/TNFSF18, REL, CD28, PF4V1, LY86, LYN, ANXA3, TNFSF8/TNFSF15, REEP3, 
ZMIZ1, OVOL1/RELA, ETS1, IGH, IRF8, TNFRSF13B and FCAR. The risk loci were 
enriched in gene orthologs causing abnormal IgA levels when genetically 
manipulated in mice. We also observed a positive genetic correlation between 
IgAN and serum IgA levels. High polygenic score for IgAN was associated with 
earlier onset of kidney failure. In a comprehensive functional annotation 
analysis of candidate causal genes, we observed convergence of biological 
candidates on a common set of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine 
ligand-receptor pairs, prioritizing potential new drug targets.

Human genetic studies of smoking behavior have been thus far largely limited to 
common variants. Studying rare coding variants has the potential to identify 
drug targets. We performed an exome-wide association study of smoking phenotypes 
in up to 749,459 individuals and discovered a protective association in CHRNB2, 
encoding the β2 subunit of the α4β2 nicotine acetylcholine receptor. Rare 
predicted loss-of-function and likely deleterious missense variants in CHRNB2 in 
aggregate were associated with a 35% decreased odds for smoking heavily (odds 
ratio (OR) = 0.65, confidence interval (CI) = 0.56-0.76, P = 1.9 × 10-8). An 
independent common variant association in the protective direction ( rs2072659 ; 
OR = 0.96; CI = 0.94-0.98; P = 5.3 × 10-6) was also evident, suggesting an 
allelic series. Our findings in humans align with decades-old experimental 
observations in mice that β2 loss abolishes nicotine-mediated neuronal responses 
and attenuates nicotine self-administration. Our genetic discovery will inspire 
future drug designs targeting CHRNB2 in the brain for the treatment of nicotine 
addiction.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease are predominantly 
carried out in European ancestry individuals despite the known variation in 
genetic architecture and disease prevalence across global populations. We 
leveraged published GWAS summary statistics from European, East Asian, and 
African American populations, and an additional GWAS from a Caribbean Hispanic 
population using previously reported genotype data to perform the largest 
multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
to date. This method allowed us to identify two independent novel 
disease-associated loci on chromosome 3. We also leveraged diverse haplotype 
structures to fine-map nine loci with a posterior probability >0.8 and globally 
assessed the heterogeneity of known risk factors across populations. 
Additionally, we compared the generalizability of multi-ancestry- and 
single-ancestry-derived polygenic risk scores in a three-way admixed Colombian 
population. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-ancestry 
representation in uncovering and understanding putative factors that contribute 
to risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

Hypertension is a polygenic disease that affects over 1.2 billion adults aged 
30-79 worldwide. It is a major risk factor for renal, cerebrovascular, and 
cardiovascular diseases. The heritability of hypertension is estimated to be 
high; nevertheless, our understanding of its underlying mechanisms remains 
scarce and incomplete. This study covered the entries from European ancestry 
from the UK-Biobank (UKB), with 74,090 cases diagnosed with essential (primary) 
hypertension and 200,734 controls. We compared the findings from large-scale 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to the gene-based method of proteome-wide 
association studies (PWAS). We focused on 70 statistically significant 
associated genes, most of which failed to reach significance in variant-based 
GWAS. A total of 30% of the PWAS-associated genes were validated against 
independent cohorts, including the Finnish Biobank. Furthermore, gene-based 
analyses that were performed on both sexes revealed sex-dependent genetics with 
a stronger genetic component associated with females. Analysis of systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure measurements confirms a strong genetic effect 
associated with females. We demonstrated that gene-based approaches provide 
insight into the underlying biology of hypertension. Specifically, the 
expression profiles of the identified genes exposed the enrichment of 
endothelial cells from multiple organs. Furthermore, females' top-ranked 
significant genes are involved in cellular immunity. We conclude that studying 
hypertension and blood pressure via gene-based association methods improves 
interpretability and exposes sex-dependent genetic effects, which enhances 
clinical utility.

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological causes of kidney disease are not fully 
understood. Here we show that the integration of genome-wide genetic, 
transcriptomic, and proteomic association studies can nominate causal 
determinants of kidney function and damage.
RESULTS: Through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in kidney cortex, 
kidney tubule, liver, and whole blood and proteome-wide association studies 
(PWAS) in plasma, we assess for effects of 12,893 genes and 1342 proteins on 
kidney filtration (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by creatinine; GFR 
estimated by cystatin C; and blood urea nitrogen) and kidney damage 
(albuminuria). We find 1561 associations distributed among 260 genomic regions 
that are supported as putatively causal. We then prioritize 153 of these genomic 
regions using additional colocalization analyses. Our genome-wide findings are 
supported by existing knowledge (animal models for MANBA, DACH1, SH3YL1, INHBB), 
exceed the underlying GWAS signals (28 region-trait combinations without 
significant GWAS hit), identify independent gene/protein-trait associations 
within the same genomic region (INHBC, SPRYD4), nominate tissues underlying the 
associations (tubule expression of NRBP1), and distinguish markers of kidney 
filtration from those with a role in creatinine and cystatin C metabolism. 
Furthermore, we follow up on members of the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins and 
find a prognostic value of INHBC for kidney disease progression even after 
adjustment for measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
CONCLUSION: In summary, this study combines multimodal, genome-wide association 
studies to generate a catalog of putatively causal target genes and proteins 
relevant to kidney function and damage which can guide follow-up studies in 
physiology, basic science, and clinical medicine.

Introduction: Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways that impairs normal 
breathing. The etiology of asthma is complex and involves multiple factors, 
including the environment and genetics, especially the distinct genetic 
architecture associated with ancestry. Compared to early-onset asthma, little is 
known about genetic predisposition to late-onset asthma. We investigated the 
race/ethnicity-specific relationship among genetic variants within the major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) region and late-onset asthma in a North 
Carolina-based multiracial cohort of adults. Methods: We stratified all analyses 
by self-reported race (i.e., White and Black) and adjusted all regression models 
for age, sex, and ancestry. We conducted association tests within the MHC region 
and performed fine-mapping analyses conditioned on the race/ethnicity-specific 
lead variant using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. We applied computational 
methods to infer human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and residues at amino 
acid positions. We replicated findings in the UK Biobank. Results: The lead 
signals, rs9265901 on the 5' end of HLA-B, rs55888430 on HLA-DOB, and 
rs117953947 on HCG17, were significantly associated with late-onset asthma in 
all, White, and Black participants, respectively (OR = 1.73, 95%CI: 1.31 to 
2.14, p = 3.62 × 10-5; OR = 3.05, 95%CI: 1.86 to 4.98, p = 8.85 × 10-6; OR = 
19.5, 95%CI: 4.37 to 87.2, p = 9.97 × 10-5, respectively). For the HLA analysis, 
HLA-B*40:02 and HLA-DRB1*04:05, HLA-B*40:02, HLA-C*04:01, and HLA-DRB1*04:05, 
and HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-DQB1 were significantly associated with late-onset 
asthma in all, White, and Black participants. Conclusion: Multiple genetic 
variants within the MHC region were significantly associated with late-onset 
asthma, and the associations were significantly different by race/ethnicity 
group.

An open challenge in human genetics is to better understand the systems-level 
impact of genotype variation on developmental cognition. To characterize the 
genetic underpinnings of peri-adolescent cognition, we performed 
genotype-phenotype and systems analysis for binarized accuracy in nine cognitive 
tasks from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (~2,200 individuals of 
European continental ancestry aged 8-21 years). We report a region of 
genome-wide significance within the 3' end of the Fibulin-1 gene 
(P = 4.6 × 10-8), associated with accuracy in nonverbal reasoning, a heritable 
form of complex reasoning ability. Diffusion tensor imaging data from a subset 
of these participants identified a significant association of white matter 
fractional anisotropy with FBLN1 genotypes (P < 0.025); poor performers show an 
increase in the C and A allele for rs77601382 and rs5765534, respectively, which 
is associated with increased fractional anisotropy. Integration of published 
human brain-specific 'omic maps, including single-cell transcriptomes of the 
developing human brain, shows that FBLN1 demonstrates greatest expression in the 
fetal brain, as a marker of intermediate progenitor cells, demonstrates 
negligible expression in the adolescent and adult human brain, and demonstrates 
increased expression in the brain in schizophrenia. Collectively these findings 
warrant further study of this gene and genetic locus in cognition, 
neurodevelopment, and disease. Separately, genotype-pathway analysis identified 
an enrichment of variants associated with working memory accuracy in pathways 
related to development and to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Top-ranking 
pathway genes include those genetically associated with diseases with working 
memory deficits, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. This work 
advances the "molecules-to-behavior" view of cognition and provides a framework 
for using systems-level organization of data for other biomedical domains.

Translation of academic results into clinical practice is a formidable unmet 
medical need. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies generate long 
descriptive ranks of markers with predicted biological function, but without 
functional validation, it remains challenging to know which markers truly exert 
the putative function. Given the lengthy/costly nature of validation studies, 
gene prioritization is required to select candidates. We address these issues by 
studying tip endothelial cell (EC) marker genes because of their importance for 
angiogenesis. Here, by tailoring Guidelines On Target Assessment for Innovative 
Therapeutics, we in silico prioritize previously unreported/poorly described, 
high-ranking tip EC markers. Notably, functional validation reveals that four of 
six candidates behave as tip EC genes. We even discover a tip EC function for a 
gene lacking in-depth functional annotation. Thus, validating prioritized genes 
from scRNA-seq studies offers opportunities for identifying targets to be 
considered for possible translation, but not all top-ranked scRNA-seq markers 
exert the predicted function.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common, highly heritable inflammatory arthritis 
characterized by enthesitis of the spine and sacroiliac joints. Genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) have revealed more than 100 genetic associations 
whose functional effects remain largely unresolved. Here, we present a 
comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic map of disease-relevant blood immune 
cell subsets from AS patients and healthy controls. We find that, while CD14+ 
monocytes and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells show disease-specific differences at the RNA 
level, epigenomic differences are only apparent upon multi-omics integration. 
The latter reveals enrichment at disease-associated loci in monocytes. We link 
putative functional SNPs to genes using high-resolution Capture-C at 10 loci, 
including PTGER4 and ETS1, and show how disease-specific functional genomic data 
can be integrated with GWASs to enhance therapeutic target discovery. This study 
combines epigenetic and transcriptional analysis with GWASs to identify 
disease-relevant cell types and gene regulation of likely pathogenic relevance 
and prioritize drug targets.

BACKGROUND: Transcription factor Dp-1 (TFDP1) was overexpressed and interacted 
with other genes to impact multiple signaling pathways in various human cancers. 
However, there is less research about the TFDP1 specific roles in lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
METHODS: We first explored TFDP1 expression levels and relative diseases from a 
pan-cancer perspective using the ONCOMINE, TIMER, and Open Targets Platform 
databases. Then, we used UALCAN, GEPIA 2, TCGA-LUAD data, and Kaplan-Meier 
plotter to examine TFDP1 clinicopathological features and prognosis in LUAD 
patients. Genomic alterations and DNA methylation analysis were performed by 
cBioPortal and MethSurv, respectively. Then, we used a cancer single-cell state 
atlas (CancerSEA) to find TFDP1 functions at a single-cell resolution. 
LinkedOmics was used to find TFDP1 coexpressed genes, biological processes, and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Then, Gene Set Cancer 
Analysis (GSCA) was used to examine the drug resistence of TFDP1 in LUAD.
RESULTS: We found that TFDP1 was overexpressed in most human cancers and related 
to various diseases, including LUAD. Moreover, LUAD patients with high TFDP1 
expression levels might be significantly associated with individual cancer 
stages and have a poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis revealed that the 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pathologic stage, AJCC stage T, and 
AJCC stage N were the independent prognostic factors. LUAD patients with TFDP1 
alterations suggested poor overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival 
(DFS), while hypermethylation might lead to a good prognosis. TFDP1 and its 
coexpressed genes were enriched in multiple signaling pathways and biological 
processes involved in the cell cycle, spliceosome, and DNA replication. 
Furthermore, TFDP1 was strongly positively related to the half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of multiple drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, TFDP1 was a possible biomarker and potential 
therapeutic target for LUAD patients.

BACKGROUND: The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable(FAIR) 
Principles explicitly require the use of FAIR vocabularies, but what precisely 
constitutes a FAIR vocabulary remains unclear. Being able to define FAIR 
vocabularies, identify features of FAIR vocabularies, and provide assessment 
approaches against the features can guide the development of vocabularies.
RESULTS: We differentiate data, data resources and vocabularies used for FAIR, 
examine the application of the FAIR Principles to vocabularies, align their 
requirements with the Open Biomedical Ontologies principles, and propose FAIR 
Vocabulary Features. We also design assessment approaches for FAIR vocabularies 
by mapping the FVFs with existing FAIR assessment indicators. Finally, we 
demonstrate how they can be used for evaluating and improving vocabularies using 
exemplary biomedical vocabularies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work proposes features of FAIR vocabularies and corresponding 
indicators for assessing the FAIR levels of different types of vocabularies, 
identifies use cases for vocabulary engineers, and guides the evolution of 
vocabularies.

GWAS has identified thousands of loci associated with disease, yet the causal 
genes within these loci remain largely unknown. Identifying these causal genes 
would enable deeper understanding of the disease and assist in genetics-based 
drug development. Exome-wide association studies (ExWAS) are more expensive but 
can pinpoint causal genes offering high-yield drug targets, yet suffer from a 
high false-negative rate. Several algorithms have been developed to prioritize 
genes at GWAS loci, such as the Effector Index (Ei), Locus-2-Gene (L2G), 
Polygenic Prioritization score (PoPs), and Activity-by-Contact score (ABC) and 
it is not known if these algorithms can predict ExWAS findings from GWAS data. 
However, if this were the case, thousands of associated GWAS loci could 
potentially be resolved to causal genes. Here, we quantified the performance of 
these algorithms by evaluating their ability to identify ExWAS significant genes 
for nine traits. We found that Ei, L2G, and PoPs can identify ExWAS significant 
genes with high areas under the precision recall curve (Ei: 0.52, L2G: 0.37, 
PoPs: 0.18, ABC: 0.14). Furthermore, we found that for every unit increase in 
the normalized scores, there was an associated 1.3-4.6-fold increase in the odds 
of a gene reaching exome-wide significance (Ei: 4.6, L2G: 2.5, PoPs: 2.1, ABC: 
1.3). Overall, we found that Ei, L2G, and PoPs can anticipate ExWAS findings 
from widely available GWAS results. These techniques are therefore promising 
when well-powered ExWAS data are not readily available and can be used to 
anticipate ExWAS findings, allowing for prioritization of genes at GWAS loci.

Most biomedical knowledge is published as text, making it challenging to analyse 
using traditional statistical methods. In contrast, machine-interpretable data 
primarily comes from structured property databases, which represent only a 
fraction of the knowledge present in the biomedical literature. Crucial insights 
and inferences can be drawn from these publications by the scientific community. 
We trained language models on literature from different time periods to evaluate 
their ranking of prospective gene-disease associations and protein-protein 
interactions. Using 28 distinct historical text corpora of abstracts published 
between 1995 and 2022, we trained independent Word2Vec models to prioritise 
associations that were likely to be reported in future years. This study 
demonstrates that biomedical knowledge can be encoded as word embeddings without 
the need for human labelling or supervision. Language models effectively capture 
drug discovery concepts such as clinical tractability, disease associations, and 
biochemical pathways. Additionally, these models can prioritise hypotheses years 
before their initial reporting. Our findings underscore the potential for 
extracting yet-to-be-discovered relationships through data-driven approaches, 
leading to generalised biomedical literature mining for potential therapeutic 
drug targets. The Publication-Wide Association Study (PWAS) enables the 
prioritisation of under-explored targets and provides a scalable system for 
accelerating early-stage target ranking, irrespective of the specific disease of 
interest.

Genetics have nominated many schizophrenia risk genes and identified convergent 
signals between schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, 
functional interpretation of the nominated genes in the relevant brain cell 
types is often lacking. We executed interaction proteomics for six schizophrenia 
risk genes that have also been implicated in neurodevelopment in human induced 
cortical neurons. The resulting protein network is enriched for common variant 
risk of schizophrenia in Europeans and East Asians, is down-regulated in layer 
5/6 cortical neurons of individuals affected by schizophrenia, and can 
complement fine-mapping and eQTL data to prioritize additional genes in GWAS 
loci. A sub-network centered on HCN1 is enriched for common variant risk and 
contains proteins (HCN4 and AKAP11) enriched for rare protein-truncating 
mutations in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Our findings 
showcase brain cell-type-specific interactomes as an organizing framework to 
facilitate interpretation of genetic and transcriptomic data in schizophrenia 
and its related disorders.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped thousands of susceptibility 
loci associated with immune-mediated diseases. To assess the extent of the 
genetic sharing across nine immune-mediated diseases we apply genomic structural 
equation modelling to GWAS data from European populations. We identify three 
disease groups: gastrointestinal tract diseases, rheumatic and systemic 
diseases, and allergic diseases. Although loci associated with the disease 
groups are highly specific, they converge on perturbing the same pathways. 
Finally, we test for colocalization between loci and single-cell eQTLs derived 
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We identify the causal route by which 
46 loci predispose to three disease groups and find evidence for eight genes 
being candidates for drug repurposing. Taken together, here we show that 
different constellations of diseases have distinct patterns of genetic 
associations, but that associated loci converge on perturbing different nodes in 
T cell activation and signalling pathways.

Understanding the target and mode of action of compounds identified by 
phenotypic screening can greatly facilitate the process of drug discovery and 
development. Here, we outline the tools currently available for target 
identification against the neglected tropical diseases, human African 
trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease. We provide examples 
how these tools can be used to identify and triage undesirable mechanisms, to 
identify potential toxic liabilities in patients and to manage a balanced 
portfolio of target-based campaigns. We review the primary targets of drugs that 
are currently in clinical development that were initially identified via 
phenotypic screening, and whose modes of action affect protein turnover, RNA 
trans-splicing or signalling in these protozoan parasites.

In addition to vaccines, the World Health Organization sees novel medications as 
an urgent matter to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. One possible strategy 
is to identify target proteins, for which a perturbation by an existing compound 
is likely to benefit COVID-19 patients. In order to contribute to this effort, 
we present GuiltyTargets-COVID-19 ( https://guiltytargets-covid.eu/ ), a machine 
learning supported web tool to identify novel candidate drug targets. Using six 
bulk and three single cell RNA-Seq datasets, together with a lung tissue 
specific protein-protein interaction network, we demonstrate that 
GuiltyTargets-COVID-19 is capable of (i) prioritizing meaningful target 
candidates and assessing their druggability, (ii) unraveling their linkage to 
known disease mechanisms, (iii) mapping ligands from the ChEMBL database to the 
identified targets, and (iv) pointing out potential side effects in the case 
that the mapped ligands correspond to approved drugs. Our example analyses 
identified 4 potential drug targets from the datasets: AKT3 from both the bulk 
and single cell RNA-Seq data as well as AKT2, MLKL, and MAPK11 in the single 
cell experiments. Altogether, we believe that our web tool will facilitate 
future target identification and drug development for COVID-19, notably in a 
cell type and tissue specific manner.

Patients with psoriasis often complain of several linked disorders including 
autoimmune and cardiometabolic diseases. Understanding of molecular link between 
psoriasis and associated comorbidities would be of great interest at the point 
of patient care management. Integrative unbiased network approach, indicates 
significant unidirectional gene overlap between psoriasis and its associated 
comorbid condition including obesity (31 upregulated and 26 downregulated), 
ischemic stroke (14 upregulated and 2 downregulated), dyslipidaemia (5 
upregulated, 5 downregulated), atherosclerosis (8 upregulated and 1 
downregulated) and type II diabetes (5 upregulated, 5 downregulated). The 
analysis revealed substantial gene sharing among the different 
psoriasis-associated comorbidities. Molecular comorbidity index determining the 
strength of the interrelation between psoriasis and its comorbidities indicates 
prevalence of dyslipidaemia followed by type II diabetes among psoriasis 
patients. The Jaccard coefficient indices revealed psoriasis shared maximum 
number of biological pathways with dyslipidaemia followed by type 2 diabetes, 
ischemic stroke, obesity and atherosclerosis. Moreover, pathway annotation 
highlighted nearly 45 shared pathways amongst psoriasis and its comorbidities 
and a substantial number of shared pathways was found among multi-morbidities. 
Overall, the present study established conceivable link between psoriasis and 
comorbid diseases. The shared genes and overlapped pathways may be explored as a 
common productive target for psoriasis and its comorbid conditions.

INTRODUCTION: African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) differ in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence, risk factors, and symptomatic presentation 
and AAs are less likely to enroll in AD clinical trials.
METHODS: We conducted race-conscious pharmacoepidemiologic studies of 5.62 
million older individuals (age ≥60) to investigate the association of 
telmisartan exposure and AD outcome using Cox analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, 
and log-rank test. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of large 
ethnically diverse genetic data to test likely causal relationships between 
telmisartan's target and AD.
RESULTS: We identified that moderate/high telmisartan exposure was significantly 
associated with a reduced incidence of AD in the AAs compared to low/no 
telmisartan exposure (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91, p-value = 
0.0022), but not in the non-Hispanic EAs (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.89-1.05, p-value 
= 0.4110). Sensitivity and sex-/age-stratified patient subgroup analyses 
identified that telmisartan's medication possession ratio (MPR) and average 
hypertension daily dosage were significantly associated with a stronger 
reduction in the incidence of both AD and dementia in AAs. Using MR analysis 
from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (over 2 million individuals) 
across AD, hypertension, and diabetes, we further identified AA-specific 
beneficial effects of telmisartan for AD.
DISCUSSION: Randomized controlled trials with ethnically diverse patient cohorts 
are warranted to establish causality and therapeutic outcomes of telmisartan and 
AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Telmisartan is associated with lower risk of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) in African Americans (AAs). Telmisartan is the only angiotensin II receptor 
blockers having PPAR-γ agonistic properties with beneficial anti-diabetic and 
renal function effects, which mitigate AD risk in AAs. Mendelian randomization 
(MR) analysis demonstrates the specificity of telmisartan's protective mechanism 
to AAs.

Discovering synthetic lethal (SL) gene partners of cancer genes is an important 
step in developing cancer therapies. However, identification of SL interactions 
is challenging, due to a large number of possible gene pairs, inherent noise and 
confounding factors in the observed signal. To discover robust SL interactions, 
we devised SLIDE-VIP, a novel framework combining eight statistical tests, 
including a new patient data-based test iSurvLRT. SLIDE-VIP leverages 
multi-omics data from four different sources: gene inactivation cell line 
screens, cancer patient data, drug screens and gene pathways. We applied 
SLIDE-VIP to discover SL interactions between genes involved in DNA damage 
repair, chromatin remodeling and cell cycle, and their potentially druggable 
partners. The top 883 ranking SL candidates had strong evidence in cell line and 
patient data, 250-fold reducing the initial space of 200K pairs. Drug screen and 
pathway tests provided additional corroboration and insights into these 
interactions. We rediscovered well-known SL pairs such as RB1 and E2F3 or PRKDC 
and ATM, and in addition, proposed strong novel SL candidates such as PTEN and 
PIK3CB. In summary, SLIDE-VIP opens the door to the discovery of SL interactions 
with clinical potential. All analysis and visualizations are available via the 
online SLIDE-VIP WebApp.

BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown that daucosterol has potential anti-tumor 
activity, but its therapeutic effect on multiple myeloma (MM) has not been 
reported. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect daucosterol 
against MM and explore its possible mechanism through network pharmacology.
METHODS: We collected daucosterol and approved drugs for MM, and their potential 
target profiles were obtained. We used 2 major methods to collect the gene sets 
related to the physiological process of MM. Based on the protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network in the STRING database, the correlation between the 
therapeutic targets of daucosterol and MM-related genes was calculated by using 
the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm to systematically evaluate the 
therapeutic potential of daucosterol for MM. On this basis, through intersection 
analysis, the potential targets of daucosterol in treating MM were identified, 
and the signaling pathways were mined. Furthermore, the key targets were 
identified. Finally, the regulatory relationship between the predicted 
daucosterol and potential targets was verified by molecular docking method, and 
the interaction mode between daucosterol and key targets was analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 13 approved drugs reported to treat MM were retrieved from 
the DrugBank database. A total of 35 potential targets of daucosterol were 
obtained, including 8 known targets and 27 newly predicted targets. In the PPI 
network, the target of daucosterol was significantly correlated with MM-related 
genes, indicating that it has therapeutic potential for MM. A total of 18 
therapeutic targets for MM were obtained, which were significantly enriched in 
the FoxO signaling pathway, prostate cancer, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, 
insulin resistance, the AMPK signaling pathway, and pathways related to the 
regulation of TP53. The core targets were HSP90AA1, MDM2, GSK3B, AKT3, PRKAA1, 
and PRKAB1. Molecular docking suggested that daucosterol had potential direct 
regulatory effects on 13 of the 18 predicted targets.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the use of daucosterol as a promising 
therapeutic drug for MM treatment. These data provide new insights into the 
potential mechanism of daucosterol in the treatment of MM, which may provide 
references for subsequent research and even the clinical treatment.

Renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is a malignancy of the renal epithelial cells 
with poor prognosis. Notably, the JAK-STAT pathway mediates cell proliferation 
and immune response. Accumulating evidence suggests that STATs act as immune 
checkpoint inhibitors in various cancers. Nonetheless, the role of STAT2 in KIRC 
remains elusive. Herein, analyses were performed using a series of interactive 
web databases including Oncomine, GEPIA and TIMER. In sub-group analyses, STAT2 
was upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in KIRC patients. Besides, 
KIRC patients with high STAT2 expression exhibited a poor overall survival. 
Moreover, Cox regression analysis revealed that STAT2 expression, nodal 
metastasis and clinical stage were independent factors affecting the prognosis 
of KIRC patients. There was a significant positive correlation between STAT2 
expression, and the abundance of immune cells as well as the expression of 
immune biomarker sets. In addition, STAT2 was found to be implicated in immune 
response, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and Toll-like receptor 
signaling pathways. Also, several cancer-related kinases, miRNAs, and 
transcription factors associated with STAT2 were identified. Conclusively, we 
revealed that STAT2 is a potential prognosis biomarker and associated with 
immune infiltration in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma. This study offers 
additional data that will help in further research on the roles of STAT2 protein 
in carcinogenesis.

Sarcopenia, characterized by age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and 
decreased physical performance, is a growing public health challenge amid the 
rapidly ageing population. As there are no approved drugs that target 
sarcopenia, it has become increasingly urgent to identify promising 
pharmacological interventions. In this study, we conducted an integrative drug 
repurposing analysis utilizing three distinct approaches. Firstly, we analyzed 
skeletal muscle transcriptomic sequencing data in humans and mice using gene 
differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression analysis, and gene 
set enrichment analysis. Subsequently, we employed gene expression profile 
similarity assessment, hub gene expression reversal, and disease-related pathway 
enrichment to identify and repurpose candidate drugs, followed by the 
integration of findings with rank aggregation algorithms. Vorinostat, the 
top-ranking drug, was also validated in an in vitro study, which demonstrated 
its efficacy in promoting muscle fiber formation. Although still requiring 
further validation in animal models and human clinical trials, these results 
suggest a promising drug repurposing prospect in the treatment and prevention of 
sarcopenia.

Database records contain useful information, which is readily available, but, 
unfortunately, limited compared to the source (publications). Our study reviewed 
the text fragments supporting the association between the biological 
macromolecules and diseases from Open Targets to map them on the biological 
level of study (DNA/RNA, proteins, metabolites). We screened records using a 
dictionary containing terms related to the selected levels of study, reviewed 
600 hits manually and used machine learning to classify 31,260 text fragments. 
Our results indicate that association studies between diseases and 
macromolecules conducted on the level of DNA and RNA prevail, followed by the 
studies on the level of proteins and metabolites. We conclude that there is a 
clear need to translate the knowledge from the DNA/RNA level to the evidence on 
the level of proteins and metabolites. Since genes and their transcripts rarely 
act in the cell by themselves, more direct evidence may be of greater value for 
basic and applied research.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm (CV) can cause inflammation and damage to 
neuronal cells in the elderly, leading to dementia.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying 
dementia caused by CV in the elderly, identify preventive and therapeutic drugs, 
and evaluate their efficacy in treating neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: Genes associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage and CV were acquired and 
screened for differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) associated with aneurysm 
rupture. A regulatory network of DEmiRNAs and mRNAs was constructed, and virtual 
screening was performed to evaluate possible binding patterns between Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and core proteins. Molecular dynamics 
simulations were performed on the optimal docked complexes. Optimally docked 
drugs were evaluated for efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases 
through cellular experiments.
RESULTS: The study found upregulated genes (including WDR43 and THBS1) and one 
downregulated gene associated with aneurysm rupture. Differences in the 
expression of these genes indicate greater disease risk. DEmiRNAs associated 
with ruptured aortic aneurysm were identified, of which two could bind to THBS1 
and WDR43. Cromolyn and lanoxin formed the best docking complexes with WDR43 and 
THBS1, respectively. Cellular experiments showed that cromolyn improved BV2 cell 
viability and enhanced Aβ42 uptake, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic 
agent for inflammation-related disorders.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that WDR43 and THBS1 are potential targets for 
preventing and treating CV-induced dementia in the elderly. Cromolyn may have 
therapeutic value in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.

The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as models for development and 
human disease has enabled the study of otherwise inaccessible tissues. A 
remaining challenge in developing reliable models is our limited understanding 
of the factors driving irregular differentiation of iPSCs, particularly the 
impact of acquired somatic mutations. We leveraged data from a pooled 
dopaminergic neuron differentiation experiment of 238 iPSC lines profiled with 
single-cell RNA and whole-exome sequencing to study how somatic mutations affect 
differentiation outcomes. We found that deleterious somatic mutations in key 
developmental genes, notably the BCOR gene, are strongly associated with failure 
in dopaminergic neuron differentiation and a larger proliferation rate in 
culture. We further identified broad differences in cell type composition 
between incorrectly and successfully differentiating lines, as well as 
significant changes in gene expression contributing to the inhibition of 
neurogenesis. Our work calls for caution in interpreting differentiation-related 
phenotypes in disease-modeling experiments.

Late-stage drug development failures are usually a consequence of ineffective 
targets. Thus, proper target identification is needed, which may be possible 
using computational approaches. The reason being, effective targets have 
disease-relevant biological functions, and omics data unveil the proteins 
involved in these functions. Also, properties that favor the existence of 
binding between drug and target are deducible from the protein's amino acid 
sequence. In this work, we developed OncoRTT, a deep learning (DL)-based method 
for predicting novel therapeutic targets. OncoRTT is designed to reduce 
suboptimal target selection by identifying novel targets based on features of 
known effective targets using DL approaches. First, we created the "OncologyTT" 
datasets, which include genes/proteins associated with ten prevalent cancer 
types. Then, we generated three sets of features for all genes: omics features, 
the proteins' amino-acid sequence BERT embeddings, and the integrated features 
to train and test the DL classifiers separately. The models achieved high 
prediction performances in terms of area under the curve (AUC), i.e., AUC 
greater than 0.88 for all cancer types, with a maximum of 0.95 for leukemia. 
Also, OncoRTT outperformed the state-of-the-art method using their data in five 
out of seven cancer types commonly assessed by both methods. Furthermore, 
OncoRTT predicts novel therapeutic targets using new test data related to the 
seven cancer types. We further corroborated these results with other validation 
evidence using the Open Targets Platform and a case study focused on the top-10 
predicted therapeutic targets for lung cancer.

Cardiometabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, 
have a high public health burden. Understanding the genetically determined 
regulation of proteins that are dysregulated in disease can help to dissect the 
complex biology underpinning them. Here, we perform a protein quantitative trait 
locus (pQTL) analysis of 248 serum proteins relevant to cardiometabolic 
processes in 2893 individuals. Meta-analyzing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data 
from two Greek cohorts, MANOLIS (n = 1356; 22.5× WGS) and Pomak (n = 1537; 18.4× 
WGS), we detect 301 independently associated pQTL variants for 170 proteins, 
including 12 rare variants (minor allele frequency < 1%). We additionally find 
15 pQTL variants that are rare in non-Finnish European populations but have 
drifted up in the frequency in the discovery cohorts here. We identify proteins 
causally associated with cardiometabolic traits, including Mep1b for 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and describe a knock-out (KO) Mep1b mouse 
model. Our findings furnish insights into the genetic architecture of the serum 
proteome, identify new protein-disease relationships and demonstrate the 
importance of isolated populations in pQTL analysis.

Associations between human genetic variation and clinical phenotypes have become 
a foundation of biomedical research. Most repositories of these data seek to be 
disease-agnostic and therefore lack disease-focused views. The Type 2 Diabetes 
Knowledge Portal (T2DKP) is a public resource of genetic datasets and genomic 
annotations dedicated to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related traits. Here, we seek 
to make the T2DKP more accessible to prospective users and more useful to 
existing users. First, we evaluate the T2DKP's comprehensiveness by comparing 
its datasets with those of other repositories. Second, we describe how 
researchers unfamiliar with human genetic data can begin using and correctly 
interpreting them via the T2DKP. Third, we describe how existing users can 
extend their current workflows to use the full suite of tools offered by the 
T2DKP. We finally discuss the lessons offered by the T2DKP toward the goal of 
democratizing access to complex disease genetic results.

SUMMARY: The outbreak of Mpox virus (MPXV) infection in May 2022 is declared a 
global health emergency by WHO. A total of 84 330 cases have been confirmed as 
of 5 January 2023 and the numbers are on the rise. The MPXV pathophysiology and 
its underlying mechanisms are unfortunately not yet understood. Likewise, the 
knowledge of biochemicals and drugs used against MPXV and their downstream 
effects is sparse. In this work, using Knowledge Graph (KG) representations we 
have depicted chemical and biological aspects of MPXV. To achieve this, we have 
collected and rationally assembled several biological study results, assays, 
drug candidates and pre-clinical evidence to form a dynamic and comprehensive 
network. The KG is compliant with FAIR annotations allowing seamless 
transformation and integration to/with other formats and infrastructures.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The programmatic scripts for Mpox KG are 
publicly available at https://github.com/Fraunhofer-ITMP/mpox-kg. It is hosted 
publicly at https://doi.org/10.18119/N9SG7D.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics

Mutations in a diverse set of driver genes increase the fitness of 
haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), leading to clonal haematopoiesis1. These 
lesions are precursors for blood cancers2-6, but the basis of their fitness 
advantage remains largely unknown, partly owing to a paucity of large cohorts in 
which the clonal expansion rate has been assessed by longitudinal sampling. 
Here, to circumvent this limitation, we developed a method to infer the 
expansion rate from data from a single time point. We applied this method to 
5,071 people with clonal haematopoiesis. A genome-wide association study 
revealed that a common inherited polymorphism in the TCL1A promoter was 
associated with a slower expansion rate in clonal haematopoiesis overall, but 
the effect varied by driver gene. Those carrying this protective allele 
exhibited markedly reduced growth rates or prevalence of clones with driver 
mutations in TET2, ASXL1, SF3B1 and SRSF2, but this effect was not seen 
in clones with driver mutations in DNMT3A. TCL1A was not expressed in normal or 
DNMT3A-mutated HSCs, but the introduction of mutations in TET2 or ASXL1 led to 
the expression of TCL1A protein and the expansion of HSCs in vitro. The 
protective allele restricted TCL1A expression and expansion of mutant HSCs, as 
did experimental knockdown of TCL1A expression. Forced expression of TCL1A 
promoted the expansion of human HSCs in vitro and mouse HSCs in vivo. Our 
results indicate that the fitness advantage of several commonly mutated driver 
genes in clonal haematopoiesis may be mediated by TCL1A activation.

PURPOSE: Zhizi-Bopi decoction (ZZBPD) is a classic herbal formula with wide 
clinical applications in treating liver diseases including hepatitis B. However, 
the mechanism needs to be elucidated.
METHODS: Chemical components of ZZBPD were identified by ultra-high-performance 
liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC-TOF-MS). Then we used network pharmacology to identify their potential 
targets. Network construction, coupled with protein-protein interaction and 
enrichment analysis was used to identify representative components and core 
targets. Finally, molecular docking simulation was conducted to further refine 
the drug-target interaction.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight active compounds were identified in ZZBPD, 
targeting 779 genes/proteins, among which 174 were related to hepatitis B. ZZBPD 
mainly influences the progression of hepatitis B through the hepatitis B pathway 
(hsa05161) via core anti-HBV targets (AKT1, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, SRC, TNF, MAPK1, and 
MAPK3). Enrichment analysis indicated that ZZBPD can also potentially regulate 
lipid metabolism and enhance cell survival. Molecular docking suggested that the 
representative active compounds can bind to the core anti-HBV targets with high 
affinity.
CONCLUSION: The potential molecular mechanisms of ZZBPD in hepatitis B treatment 
were identified using network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches. The 
results serve as an important basis for the modernization of ZZBPD.

Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to 
be a critical factor in tumor development and cancer progression. Although 
established EGFR inhibitors have been effective in the treatment of cancer, they 
are associated with several side effects. As a result, there is an urgent need 
to develop novel EGFR inhibitors that can effectively target the receptor while 
causing no adverse side effects. Here, the bioactive compounds of Glycyrrhiza 
glabra and established EGFR inhibitors have been screened against the EGFR 
catalytic site. The compounds LTS0058805, LTS0114552, LTS0128805, LTS0174203, 
LTS0007447, and LTS0164690 exhibited binding energies to the EGFR that were 
comparable to those of established EGFR inhibitors. Further, these hit compounds 
were observed to interact with critical residues of the EGFR, suggesting their 
potential as inhibitors of the receptor. In addition, these hits possess good 
drug-like properties and merit further exploration for their potential 
application in cancer management.

Advancements in deep plasma proteomics are enabling high-resolution measurement 
of plasma proteoforms, which may reveal a rich source of novel biomarkers 
previously concealed by aggregated protein methods. Here, we analyze 188 plasma 
proteomes from non-small cell lung cancer subjects (NSCLC) and controls to 
identify NSCLC-associated protein isoforms by examining differentially abundant 
peptides as a proxy for isoform-specific exon usage. We find four proteins 
comprised of peptides with opposite patterns of abundance between cancer and 
control subjects. One of these proteins, BMP1, has known isoforms that can 
explain this differential pattern, for which the abundance of the 
NSCLC-associated isoform increases with stage of NSCLC progression. The presence 
of cancer and control-associated isoforms suggests differential regulation of 
BMP1 isoforms. The identified BMP1 isoforms have known functional differences, 
which may reveal insights into mechanisms impacting NSCLC disease progression.

Incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined by a diagnosed age 
under 50 years, is increasing, but its heterogeneous etiologies that differ from 
general CRC remain undetermined. We initially characterize the genome, 
epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome of tumors from 79 patients in a Chinese 
CRC cohort. Data for an additional 126 EOCRC subjects are obtained from the 
International Cancer Genome Consortium Chinese cohort and The Cancer Genome 
Atlas European cohort. We observe that early-onset tumors have a high tumor 
mutation burden; increased DNA repair features by mutational signature 3 and 
multi-layer pathway enrichments; strong perturbations at effects of DNA 
methylation and somatic copy-number alteration on gene expression; and 
upregulated immune infiltration as hot tumors underlying immunophenotypes. 
Notably, LMTK3 exhibits ancestral mutation disparity, potentially being a 
functional modulator and biomarker that drives molecular alterations in EOCRC 
development and immunotherapies. This integrative omics study provides valuable 
knowledge for precision oncology of CRC.

BACKGROUND: A key histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 
presence of neurofibrillary tangles of aggregated microtubule-associated protein 
tau in neurons. Anle138b is a small molecule which has previously shown efficacy 
in mice in reducing tau aggregates and rescuing AD disease phenotypes.
METHODS: In this work, we employed bioinformatics analysis-including pathway 
enrichment and causal reasoning-of an in vitro tauopathy model. The model 
consisted of cultured rat cortical neurons either unseeded or seeded with tau 
aggregates derived from human AD patients, both of which were treated with 
Anle138b to generate hypotheses for its mode of action. In parallel, we used a 
collection of human target prediction models to predict direct targets of 
Anle138b based on its chemical structure.
RESULTS: Combining the different approaches, we found evidence supporting the 
hypothesis that the action of Anle138b involves several processes which are key 
to AD progression, including cholesterol homeostasis and neuroinflammation. On 
the pathway level, we found significantly enriched pathways related to these two 
processes including those entitled "Superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis" 
and "Granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis". With causal reasoning, we inferred 
differential activity of SREBF1/2 (involved in cholesterol regulation) and 
mediators of the inflammatory response such as NFKB1 and RELA. Notably, our 
findings were also observed in Anle138b-treated unseeded neurons, meaning that 
the inferred processes are independent of tau pathology and thus represent the 
direct action of the compound in the cellular system. Through structure-based 
ligand-target prediction, we predicted the intracellular cholesterol carrier 
NPC1 as well as NF-κB subunits as potential targets of Anle138b, with 
structurally similar compounds in the model training set known to target the 
same proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has generated feasible hypotheses for the potential 
mechanism of action of Anle138b, which will enable the development of future 
molecular interventions aiming to reduce tau pathology in AD patients.

The 3-dimensional spatial and 2-dimensional frontal QRS-T angles are measures 
derived from the vectorcardiogram. They are independent risk predictors for 
arrhythmia, but the underlying biology is unknown. Using multi-ancestry 
genome-wide association studies we identify 61 (58 previously unreported) loci 
for the spatial QRS-T angle (N = 118,780) and 11 for the frontal QRS-T angle 
(N = 159,715). Seven out of the 61 spatial QRS-T angle loci have not been 
reported for other electrocardiographic measures. Enrichments are observed in 
pathways related to cardiac and vascular development, muscle contraction, and 
hypertrophy. Pairwise genome-wide association studies with classical ECG traits 
identify shared genetic influences with PR interval and QRS 
duration. Phenome-wide scanning indicate associations with atrial fibrillation, 
atrioventricular block and arterial embolism and genetically determined QRS-T 
angle measures are associated with fascicular and bundle branch block (and also 
atrioventricular block for the frontal QRS-T angle). We identify potential 
biology involved in the QRS-T angle and their genetic relationships with 
cardiovascular traits and diseases, may inform future research and risk 
prediction.

Generation of a molecular neuroanatomical map of the human prefrontal cortex 
reveals novel spatial domains and cell-cell interactions relevant for 
psychiatric disease. The molecular organization of the human neocortex has been 
historically studied in the context of its histological layers. However, 
emerging spatial transcriptomic technologies have enabled unbiased 
identification of transcriptionally-defined spatial domains that move beyond 
classic cytoarchitecture. Here we used the Visium spatial gene expression 
platform to generate a data-driven molecular neuroanatomical atlas across the 
anterior-posterior axis of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). 
Integration with paired single nucleus RNA-sequencing data revealed distinct 
cell type compositions and cell-cell interactions across spatial domains. Using 
PsychENCODE and publicly available data, we map the enrichment of cell types and 
genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders to discrete spatial domains. 
Finally, we provide resources for the scientific community to explore these 
integrated spatial and single cell datasets at research.libd.org/spatialDLPFC/.

Herein, we report a proof-of-concept result of sex-specific protein corona 
compositions on the surface of silica NPs as a function of their size and 
porosity upon incubation with plasma proteins of female and male BALB/c mice. 
Our results demonstrate substantial differences between male and female protein 
corona profiles on the surface of silica nanoparticles. By comparing protein 
abundances between male and female protein coronas of mesoporous silica 
nanoparticles and Stöber silica nanoparticles of ∼100, 50, and 100 nm in 
diameter, respectively, we detected 17, 4, and 4 distinct proteins, 
respectively, that were found at significantly different concentrations for 
these constructs. These initial findings demonstrate that animal sex can 
influence protein corona formation on silica NPs as a function of the 
physicochemical properties. A more thorough consideration of the role of plasma 
sex would enable nanomedicine community to design and develop safer and more 
efficient diagnostic and therapeutic nanomedicine products for both sexes.

Modeling biological mechanisms is a key for disease understanding and 
drug-target identification. However, formulating quantitative models in the 
field of Alzheimer's Disease is challenged by a lack of detailed knowledge of 
relevant biochemical processes. Additionally, fitting differential equation 
systems usually requires time resolved data and the possibility to perform 
intervention experiments, which is difficult in neurological disorders. This 
work addresses these challenges by employing the recently published Variational 
Autoencoder Modular Bayesian Networks (VAMBN) method, which we here trained on 
combined clinical and patient level gene expression data while incorporating a 
disease focused knowledge graph. Our approach, called iVAMBN, resulted in a 
quantitative model that allowed us to simulate a down-expression of the putative 
drug target CD33, including potential impact on cognitive impairment and brain 
pathophysiology. Experimental validation demonstrated a high overlap of 
molecular mechanism predicted to be altered by CD33 perturbation with cell line 
data. Altogether, our modeling approach may help to select promising drug 
targets.

Extracellular vesicles (EV) are membranous particles secreted by all cells and 
found in body fluids. Established EV contents include a variety of RNA species, 
proteins, lipids and metabolites that are considered to reflect the 
physiological status of their parental cells. However, to date, little is known 
about cell-type enriched EV cargo in complex EV mixtures, especially in urine. 
To test whether EV secretion from distinct human kidney cells in culture differ 
and can recapitulate findings in normal urine, we comprehensively analysed EV 
components, (particularly miRNAs, long RNAs and protein) from conditionally 
immortalised human kidney cell lines (podocyte, glomerular endothelial, 
mesangial and proximal tubular cells) and compared to EV secreted in human 
urine. EV from cell culture media derived from immortalised kidney cells were 
isolated by hydrostatic filtration dialysis (HFD) and characterised by electron 
microscopy (EM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and Western blotting (WB). 
RNA was isolated from EV and subjected to miRNA and RNA sequencing and proteins 
were profiled by tandem mass tag proteomics. Representative sets of EV miRNAs, 
RNAs and proteins were detected in each cell type and compared to human urinary 
EV isolates (uEV), EV cargo database, kidney biopsy bulk RNA sequencing and 
proteomics, and single-cell transcriptomics. This revealed that a high 
proportion of the in vitro EV signatures were also found in in vivo datasets. 
Thus, highlighting the robustness of our in vitro model and showing that this 
approach enables the dissection of cell type specific EV cargo in biofluids and 
the potential identification of cell-type specific EV biomarkers of kidney 
disease.

OBJECTIVE: To infer potential mechanisms driving disease subtypes among patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we profiled the transcriptome of purified 
circulating monocytes and CD4 T-cells.
DESIGN: RNA extracted from purified monocytes and CD4 T-cells derived from the 
peripheral blood of 125 endoscopically active patients with IBD was sequenced 
using Illumina HiSeq 4000NGS. We used complementary supervised and unsupervised 
analytical methods to infer gene expression signatures associated with 
demographic/clinical features. Expression differences and specificity were 
validated by comparison with publicly available single cell datasets, 
tissue-specific expression and meta-analyses. Drug target information, 
druggability and adverse reaction records were used to prioritise disease 
subtype-specific therapeutic targets.
RESULTS: Unsupervised/supervised methods identified significant differences in 
the expression profiles of CD4 T-cells between patients with ileal Crohn's 
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Following a pathway-based 
classification (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic - AUROC=86%) 
between ileal-CD and UC patients, we identified MAPK and FOXO pathways to be 
downregulated in UC. Coexpression module/regulatory network analysis using 
systems-biology approaches revealed mediatory core transcription factors. We 
independently confirmed that a subset of the disease location-associated 
signature is characterised by T-cell-specific and location-specific expression. 
Integration of drug-target information resulted in the discovery of several new 
(BCL6, GPR183, TNFAIP3) and repurposable drug targets (TUBB2A, PRKCQ) for ileal 
CD as well as novel targets (NAPEPLD, SLC35A1) for UC.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic profiling of circulating CD4 T-cells in patients 
with IBD demonstrated marked molecular differences between the IBD-spectrum 
extremities (UC and predominantly ileal CD, sandwiching colonic CD), which could 
help in prioritising particular drug targets for IBD subtypes.

Problematic alcohol use (PAU) is a leading cause of death and disability 
worldwide. To improve our understanding of the genetics of PAU, we conducted a 
large cross-ancestry meta-analysis of PAU in 1,079,947 individuals. We observed 
a high degree of cross-ancestral similarity in the genetic architecture of PAU 
and identified 110 independent risk variants in within- and cross-ancestry 
analyses. Cross-ancestry fine-mapping improved the identification of likely 
causal variants. Prioritizing genes through gene expression and/or chromatin 
interaction in brain tissues identified multiple genes associated with PAU. We 
identified existing medications for potential pharmacological studies by drug 
repurposing analysis. Cross-ancestry polygenic risk scores (PRS) showed better 
performance in independent sample than single-ancestry PRS. Genetic correlations 
between PAU and other traits were observed in multiple ancestries, with other 
substance use traits having the highest correlations. The analysis of diverse 
ancestries contributed significantly to the findings, and fills an important gap 
in the literature.

Existing phenotype ontologies were originally developed to represent phenotypes 
that manifest as a character state in relation to a wild-type or other 
reference. However, these do not include the phenotypic trait or attribute 
categories required for the annotation of genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS), Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mappings or any population-focused 
measurable trait data. Moreover, variations in gene expression in response to 
environmental disturbances even without any genetic alterations can also be 
associated with particular biological attributes. The integration of trait and 
biological attribute information with an ever increasing body of chemical, 
environmental and biological data greatly facilitates computational analyses and 
it is also highly relevant to biomedical and clinical applications. The Ontology 
of Biological Attributes (OBA) is a formalised, species-independent collection 
of interoperable phenotypic trait categories that is intended to fulfil a data 
integration role. OBA is a standardised representational framework for 
observable attributes that are characteristics of biological entities, 
organisms, or parts of organisms. OBA has a modular design which provides 
several benefits for users and data integrators, including an automated and 
meaningful classification of trait terms computed on the basis of logical 
inferences drawn from domain-specific ontologies for cells, anatomical and other 
relevant entities. The logical axioms in OBA also provide a previously missing 
bridge that can computationally link Mendelian phenotypes with GWAS and 
quantitative traits. The term components in OBA provide semantic links and 
enable knowledge and data integration across specialised research community 
boundaries, thereby breaking silos.

Outcomes for most patients with Ewing sarcoma (ES) have remained unchanged for 
the last 30 years, emphasising the need for more effective and tolerable 
treatments. We have hypothesised that using small-molecule inhibitors to kill 
the self-renewing chemotherapy-resistant cells (Ewing sarcoma cancer stem-like 
cells; ES-CSCs) responsible for progression and relapse could improve outcomes 
and minimise treatment-induced morbidities. For the first time, we demonstrate 
that ABCG1, a potential oncogene in some cancers, is highly expressed in ES-CSCs 
independently of CD133. Using functional models, transcriptomics and a bespoke 
in silico drug-repurposing pipeline, we have prioritised a group of tractable 
small-molecule inhibitors for further preclinical studies. Consistent with the 
cellular origin of ES, 21 candidate molecular targets of pluripotency, stemness 
and chemoresistance were identified. Small-molecule inhibitors to 13 of the 21 
molecular targets (62%) were identified. POU5F1/OCT4 was the most promising new 
therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma, interacting with 10 of the 21 prioritised 
molecular targets and meriting further study. The majority of small-molecule 
inhibitors (72%) target one of two drug efflux proteins, p-glycoprotein (n = 
168) or MRP1 (n = 13). In summary, we have identified a novel cell surface 
marker of ES-CSCs and cancer/non-cancer drugs to targets expressed by these 
cells that are worthy of further preclinical evaluation. If effective in 
preclinical models, these drugs and drug combinations might be repurposed for 
clinical evaluation in patients with ES.

Richter syndrome (RS) is the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL) into aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL). We characterize 58 primary human RS samples by genome-wide DNA 
methylation and whole-transcriptome profiling. Our comprehensive approach 
determines RS DNA methylation profile and unravels a CLL epigenetic imprint, 
allowing CLL-RS clonal relationship assessment without the need of the initial 
CLL tumor DNA. DNA methylation- and transcriptomic-based classifiers were 
developed, and testing on landmark DLBCL datasets identifies a poor-prognosis, 
activated B-cell-like DLBCL subset in 111/1772 samples. The classification 
robustly identifies phenotypes very similar to RS with a specific genomic 
profile, accounting for 4.3-8.3% of de novo DLBCLs. In this work, RS multi-omics 
characterization determines oncogenic mechanisms, establishes a surrogate marker 
for CLL-RS clonal relationship, and provides a clinically relevant classifier 
for a subset of primary "RS-type DLBCL" with unfavorable prognosis.

Chronic nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) has been shown to be 
significantly higher in GPA patients when compared to healthy subjects, as well 
as being associated with increased endonasal activity and disease relapse. The 
aim of this study was to investigate SA involvement in GPA by applying a 
network-based analysis (NBA) approach to publicly available nasal transcriptomic 
data. Using these data, our NBA pipeline generated a proteinase 3 (PR3) positive 
ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) disease network integrating differentially 
expressed genes, dysregulated transcription factors (TFs), disease-specific 
genes derived from GWAS studies, drug-target and protein-protein interactions. 
The PR3+ AAV disease network captured genes previously reported to be 
dysregulated in AAV associated. A subnetwork focussing on interactions between 
SA virulence factors and enriched biological processes revealed potential 
mechanisms for SA's involvement in PR3+ AAV. Immunosuppressant treatment reduced 
differential expression and absolute TF activities in this subnetwork for 
patients with inactive nasal disease but not active nasal disease symptoms at 
the time of sampling. The disease network generated identified the key molecular 
signatures and highlighted the associated biological processes in PR3+ AAV and 
revealed potential mechanisms for SA to affect these processes.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) comprising ulcerative colitis, Crohn's 
disease and microscopic colitis are characterized by chronic inflammation of the 
gastrointestinal tract. IBD has spread around the world and is becoming more 
prevalent at an alarming rate in developing countries whose societies have 
become more westernized. Cell therapy, intestinal microecology, apheresis 
therapy, exosome therapy and small molecules are emerging therapeutic options 
for IBD. Currently, it is thought that low-molecular-mass substances with good 
oral bio-availability and the ability to permeate the cell membrane to regulate 
the action of elements of the inflammatory signaling pathway are effective 
therapeutic options for the treatment of IBD. Several small molecule inhibitors 
are being developed as a promising alternative for IBD therapy. The use of 
highly efficient and time-saving techniques, such as computational methods, is 
still a viable option for the development of these small molecule drugs. The 
computer-aided (in silico) discovery approach is one drug development technique 
that has mostly proven efficacy. Computational approaches when combined with 
traditional drug development methodology dramatically boost the likelihood of 
drug discovery in a sustainable and cost-effective manner. This review focuses 
on the modern drug discovery approaches for the design of novel IBD drugs with 
an emphasis on the role of computational methods. Some computational approaches 
to IBD genomic studies, target identification, and virtual screening for the 
discovery of new drugs and in the repurposing of existing drugs are discussed.

The Open Targets Platform (https://platform.opentargets.org/) is an open source 
resource to systematically assist drug target identification and prioritisation 
using publicly available data. Since our last update, we have reimagined, 
redesigned, and rebuilt the Platform in order to streamline data integration and 
harmonisation, expand the ways in which users can explore the data, and improve 
the user experience. The gene-disease causal evidence has been enhanced and 
expanded to better capture disease causality across rare, common, and somatic 
diseases. For target and drug annotations, we have incorporated new features 
that help assess target safety and tractability, including genetic constraint, 
PROTACtability assessments, and AlphaFold structure predictions. We have also 
introduced new machine learning applications for knowledge extraction from the 
published literature, clinical trial information, and drug labels. The new 
technologies and frameworks introduced since the last update will ease the 
introduction of new features and the creation of separate instances of the 
Platform adapted to user requirements. Our new Community forum, expanded 
training materials, and outreach programme support our users in a range of use 
cases.

The term moonlighting proteins refers to those proteins that present alternative 
functions performed by a single polypeptide chain acquired throughout evolution 
(called canonical and moonlighting, respectively). Over 78% of moonlighting 
proteins are involved in human diseases, 48% are targeted by current drugs, and 
over 25% of them are involved in the virulence of pathogenic microorganisms. 
These facts encouraged us to study the link between the functions of 
moonlighting proteins and disease. We found a large number of moonlighting 
functions activated by pathological conditions that are highly involved in 
disease development and progression. The factors that activate some moonlighting 
functions take place only in pathological conditions, such as specific cellular 
translocations or changes in protein structure. Some moonlighting functions are 
involved in disease promotion while others are involved in curbing it. The 
disease-impairing moonlighting functions attempt to restore the homeostasis, or 
to reduce the damage linked to the imbalance caused by the disease. The 
disease-promoting moonlighting functions primarily involve the immune system, 
mesenchyme cross-talk, or excessive tissue proliferation. We often find 
moonlighting functions linked to the canonical function in a pathological 
context. Moonlighting functions are especially coordinated in inflammation and 
cancer. Wound healing and epithelial to mesenchymal transition are very 
representative. They involve multiple moonlighting proteins with a different 
role in each phase of the process, contributing to the current-phase phenotype 
or promoting a phase switch, mitigating the damage or intensifying the 
remodeling. All of this implies a new level of complexity in the study of 
pathology genesis, progression, and treatment. The specific protein function 
involved in a patient's progress or that is affected by a drug must be 
elucidated for the correct treatment of diseases.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Notwithstanding the 
huge investments in drug development, only one disease-modifying treatment has 
been recently approved. Here we present a single-cell-led systems biology 
pipeline for the identification of drug repurposing candidates. Using 
single-cell RNA sequencing data of brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer's 
disease, genome-wide association study results, and multiple gene annotation 
resources, we built a multi-cellular Alzheimer's disease molecular network that 
we leveraged for gaining cell-specific insights into Alzheimer's disease 
pathophysiology and for the identification of drug repurposing candidates. Our 
computational approach pointed out 54 candidate drugs, mainly targeting MAPK and 
IGF1R signaling pathways, which could be further evaluated for their potential 
as Alzheimer's disease therapy.

The multi-system involvement and high heterogeneity of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) pose great challenges to its diagnosis and treatment. The 
purpose of the current study is to identify genes and pathways involved in the 
pathogenesis of SLE. High throughput sequencing was performed on the PBMCs from 
SLE patients. We conducted differential gene analysis, gene ontology (GO) 
analysis, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis, and 
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) verification. Protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) analysis, alternative splicing analysis, and disease correlation analysis 
were conducted on some key pathogenic genes as well. Furthermore, si-CDC6 was 
used for transfection and cell proliferation was monitored using a cell counting 
kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. We identified 2495 differential genes (1494 upregulated and 
1001 downregulated) in SLE patients compared with healthy controls. The 
significantly upregulated genes were enriched in the biological process-related 
GO terms of the cell cycle, response to stress, and chromosome organization. 
KEGG enrichment analysis revealed 7 significantly upregulated pathways including 
SLE, alcoholism, viral carcinogenesis, cell cycle, proteasome, malaria, and 
transcriptional misregulation in cancer. We successfully verified some 
differential genes on the SLE pathway and the cell cycle pathway. CDC6, a key 
gene in the cell cycle pathway, had remarkably higher MXE alternative splicing 
events in SLE patients than that in controls, which may explain its significant 
upregulation in SLE patients. We found that CDC6 participates in the 
pathogenesis of many proliferation-related diseases and its levels are 
positively correlated with the severity of SLE. Knockdown of CDC6 suppressed the 
proliferation of Hela cells and PBMCs from SLE patients in vitro. We identified 
SLE-related genes and their alternative splicing events. The cell cycle pathway 
and the cell cycle-related biological processes are over-activated in SLE 
patients. We revealed a higher incidence of MXE events of CDC6, which may lead 
to its high expression in SLE patients. Upregulated cell cycle signaling and 
CDC6 may be related to the hyperproliferation and pathogenesis of SLE.

Several psychosocial, sleep/circadian, and cardiometabolic disorders have 
intricately interconnected pathologies involving melatonin disruption. 
Therefore, we hypothesize that melatonin could be a therapeutic target for 
treating potential comorbid diseases associated with this triad of 
psychosocial-sleep/circadian-cardiometabolic disorders. We investigated 
melatonin's target prediction and tractability for this triad of disorders. The 
melatonin's target prediction for the proposed 
psychosocial-sleep/circadian-cardiometabolic disorder triad was investigated 
using databases from Europe PMC, ChEMBL, Open Targets Genetics, Phenodigm, and 
PheWAS. The association scores for melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 with this 
disorder triad were explored for evidence of target-disease predictions. The 
potential of melatonin as a tractable target in managing the disorder triad was 
investigated using supervised machine learning to identify melatonin activities 
in cardiovascular, neuronal, and metabolic assays at the cell, tissue, and 
organism levels in a curated ChEMBL database. Target-disease visualization was 
done by graphs created using "igraph" library-based scripts and displayed using 
the Gephi ForceAtlas algorithm. The combined Europe PMC (data type: text 
mining), ChEMBL (data type: drugs), Open Targets Genetics Portal (data type: 
genetic associations), PhenoDigm (data type: animal models), and PheWAS (data 
type: genetic associations) databases yielded types and varying levels of 
evidence for melatonin-disease triad correlations. Of the investigated 
databases, 235 association scores of melatonin receptors with the targeted 
diseases were greater than 0.2; to classify the evidence per disease class: 37% 
listed psychosocial disorders, 9% sleep/circadian disorders, and 54% 
cardiometabolic disorders. Using supervised machine learning, 546 
cardiovascular, neuronal, or metabolic experimental assays with predicted or 
measured melatonin activity scores were identified in the ChEMBL curated 
database. Of 248 registered trials, 144 phase I to IV trials for melatonin or 
agonists have been completed, of which 33.3% were for psychosocial disorders, 
59.7% were for sleep/circadian disorders, and 6.9% were for cardiometabolic 
disorders. Melatonin's druggability was evidenced by evaluating target 
prediction and tractability for the triad of 
psychosocial-sleep/circadian-cardiometabolic disorders. While melatonin research 
and development in sleep/circadian and psychosocial disorders is more advanced, 
as evidenced by melatonin association scores, substantial evidence on melatonin 
discovery in cardiovascular and metabolic disorders supports continued R&D in 
cardiometabolic disorders, as evidenced by melatonin activity scores. A 
multiplatform analysis provided an integrative assessment of the target-disease 
investigations that may justify further translational research.

Delivering better care for patients with bladder cancer (BC) necessitates the 
development of novel therapeutic strategies that address both the high disease 
heterogeneity and the limitations of the current therapeutic modalities, such as 
drug low efficacy and patient resistance acquisition. Drug repurposing is a 
cost-effective strategy that targets the reuse of existing drugs for new 
therapeutic purposes. Such a strategy could open new avenues toward more 
effective BC treatment. BC patients' multi-omics signatures can be used to guide 
the investigation of existing drugs that show an effective therapeutic potential 
through drug repurposing. In this book chapter, we present an integrated 
multilayer approach that includes cross-omics analyses from publicly available 
transcriptomics and proteomics data derived from BC tissues and cell lines that 
were investigated for the development of disease-specific signatures. These 
signatures are subsequently used as input for a signature-based repurposing 
approach using the Connectivity Map (CMap) tool. We further explain the steps 
that may be followed to identify and select existing drugs of increased 
potential for repurposing in BC patients.

BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) has benefited from genomic analyses, including those that leverage 
polygenic risk score (PRS) models of disease. The use of functional annotation 
has been able to improve the power of genomic models.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to leverage genomic functional annotations to build 
tissue-specific AD PRS models and study their relationship with AD and its 
biomarkers.
METHODS: We built 13 tissue-specific AD PRS and studied the scores' 
relationships with AD diagnosis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid, CSF tau, and 
other CSF biomarkers in two longitudinal cohort studies of AD.
RESULTS: The AD PRS model that was most predictive of AD diagnosis (even without 
APOE) was the liver AD PRS: n = 1,115; odds ratio = 2.15 (1.67-2.78), 
p = 3.62×10-9. The liver AD PRS was also statistically significantly associated 
with cerebrospinal fluid biomarker evidence of amyloid-β (Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio, 
p = 3.53×10-6) and the phosphorylated tau:amyloid-β ratio (p = 1.45×10-5).
CONCLUSION: These findings provide further evidence of the role of the 
liver-functional genome in AD and the benefits of incorporating functional 
annotation into genomic research.

MOTIVATION: Identifying appropriate pharmacotherapy options from genomics 
results is a significant challenge in personalized oncology. However, 
computational methods for prioritizing drugs are underdeveloped. With the 
hypothesis that network-based approaches can improve the performance by 
extending the use of potential drug targets beyond direct interactions, we 
devised two network-based methods for personalized pharmacotherapy 
prioritization in cancer.
RESULTS: We developed novel personalized drug prioritization approaches, 
PANACEA: PersonAlized Network-based Anti-Cancer therapy EvaluAtion. In PANACEA, 
initially, the protein interaction network is extended with drugs, and a 
driverness score is assigned to each altered gene. For scoring drugs, either (i) 
the 'distance-based' method, incorporating the shortest distance between drugs 
and altered genes, and driverness scores, or (ii) the 'propagation' method 
involving the propagation of driverness scores via a random walk with restart 
framework is performed. We evaluated PANACEA using multiple datasets, and 
demonstrated that (i) the top-ranking drugs are relevant for cancer 
pharmacotherapy using TCGA data; (ii) drugs that cancer cell lines are sensitive 
to are identified using GDSC data; and (iii) PANACEA can perform adequately in 
the clinical setting using cases with known drug responses. We also illustrate 
that the proposed methods outperform iCAGES and PanDrugs, two previous 
personalized drug prioritization approaches.

Population isolates such as those in Finland benefit genetic research because 
deleterious alleles are often concentrated on a small number of low-frequency 
variants (0.1% ≤ minor allele frequency < 5%). These variants survived the 
founding bottleneck rather than being distributed over a large number of 
ultrarare variants. Although this effect is well established in Mendelian 
genetics, its value in common disease genetics is less explored1,2. FinnGen aims 
to study the genome and national health register data of 500,000 Finnish 
individuals. Given the relatively high median age of participants (63 years) and 
the substantial fraction of hospital-based recruitment, FinnGen is enriched for 
disease end points. Here we analyse data from 224,737 participants from FinnGen 
and study 15 diseases that have previously been investigated in large 
genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also include meta-analyses of 
biobank data from Estonia and the United Kingdom. We identified 30 new 
associations, primarily low-frequency variants, enriched in the Finnish 
population. A GWAS of 1,932 diseases also identified 2,733 genome-wide 
significant associations (893 phenome-wide significant (PWS), P < 2.6 × 10-11) 
at 2,496 (771 PWS) independent loci with 807 (247 PWS) end points. Among these, 
fine-mapping implicated 148 (73 PWS) coding variants associated with 83 (42 PWS) 
end points. Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of <5% in non-Finnish 
European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in 
Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to 
find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, 
high impact variants.

Since early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed the world, resulting in 
more than half a billion infections and over 6 million deaths within a 28-month 
period. Knowledge about the disease remains largely disjointed, especially when 
considering the molecular mechanisms driving the diversity of clinical 
manifestations and symptoms. Despite the recent availability of vaccines, there 
remains an urgent need to develop effective treatments for cases of severe 
disease, especially in the face of novel virus variants. The complexity of the 
situation is exacerbated by the emergence of COVID-19 as a complex and 
multifaceted systemic disease affecting independent tissues and organs 
throughout the body. The development of effective treatment strategies is 
therefore predicated on an integrated understanding of the underlying disease 
mechanisms and their potentially causative link to the diversity of observed 
clinical phenotypes. To address this need, we utilized a computational 
technology (the Dataome platform) to build an integrated clinico-molecular view 
on the most important COVID-19 clinical phenotypes. Our results provide the 
first integrated, whole-patient model of COVID-19 symptomatology that connects 
the molecular lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2 with microvesicle-mediated intercellular 
communication and the contact activation and kallikrein-kinin systems. The model 
not only explains the clinical pleiotropy of COVID-19, but also provides an 
evidence-driven framework for drug development/repurposing and the 
identification of critical risk factors. The associated knowledge is provided in 
the form of the open source COVID-19 Explorer 
(https://covid19.molecularhealth.com), enabling the global community to explore 
and analyze the key molecular features of systemic COVID-19 and associated 
implications for research priorities and therapeutic strategies. Our work 
suggests that knowledge modeling solutions may offer important utility in 
expediting the global response to future health emergencies.

BACKGROUND: CD161 has been linked to the appearance and development of various 
cancers.
METHODS: The mutation map and the variation of CNVs and SNVs of CD161 were 
displayed according to cBioportal and GSCALite. We also evaluated the pathway 
enrichment and drug sensitivity of CD161 according to GSCALite. We performed a 
single-cell sequencing analysis of cancer cells and T cells in melanoma. The 
cell communication patterns related to CD161 were further explored. Multiplex 
immunofluorescence staining of tissue microarrays was used to detect the 
association between CD161 expression and macrophages and T cells.
RESULTS: A high CD161 level was related to neoantigens expression, pathway 
enrichment, and drug sensitivity. In addition, single-cell sequencing analysis 
showed that CD161 was mainly expressed in T cells, M1 and M2 Macrophages, 
neoplastic, microglial cells, neurons, and cancer cells in many tumor types. 
Further study on pseudotime trajectories and functional annotation of CD161 
proved the critical role of CD161 in tumor progression and T cell immunity in 
melanoma. Multiplex immunofluorescence revealed that CD161 is closely correlated 
with the immune infiltration of T cells and macrophages in multiple cancers. In 
addition, high CD161 expression predicted a favorable immunotherapy response.
CONCLUSION: CD161 is involved in the immune infiltration of T cells and 
macrophages and might be a promising target for tumor immunotherapy.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease 
with limited treatment options. The widely distributed plant Aloe vera has shown 
protective effects against NASH in animals, yet the precise mechanism remains 
unknown. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the 
anti-NASH effects of Aloe vera using a network pharmacology and molecular 
docking approach. By searching online databases and analyzing the Gene 
Expression Omnibus dataset, we obtained 260 Aloe vera-NASH common targets. Gene 
Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses showed 
that the common targets were strongly associated with the key pathological 
processes implicated in NASH, including lipid and glucose metabolism, 
inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and liver fibrosis. Four core 
proteins, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNFα), transcription factor c-Jun, and tumor suppressor protein p53, were 
identified from compound-target-pathway and protein-protein interaction 
networks. Molecular docking analysis verified that the active ingredients of 
Aloe vera were able to interact with the core proteins, especially AKT1 and 
TNFα. The results demonstrate the multi-compound, multi-target, and 
multi-pathway mechanisms of Aloe vera against NASH. Our study has shown the 
scientific basis for further experiments in terms of the mechanism to develop 
Aloe vera-based natural products as complementary treatments for NASH. 
Furthermore, it identifies novel drug candidates based on the structures of Aloe 
vera's active compounds.

INTRODUCTION: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic condition 
characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of the esophagus which leads to 
esophageal dysfunction with common symptoms including vomiting, feeding 
difficulty, dysphagia, abdominal pain. Current main treatment options of EoE 
include dietary elimination and swallowed steroids. Diet elimination approach 
could lead to identifying the trigger food(s), but it often requires repeated 
upper endoscopy with general anesthesia and potentially could negatively affect 
nutrition intake and growth of the child and individuals' quality of life. 
Although the swallowed steroid treatment of effective, the EoE will universally 
recur after discontinuation of the treatment. Digestive Tea formula (DTF) has 
been used by the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practice to improve GI 
symptoms in EoE patients, including abdominal pain, GE reflux, and abnormal 
bowel movement. Previously, a flavonoid small molecule compound 7, 4 dihydroxy 
flavone (DHF) from Glycyrrhiza uralensis in DTF inhibited eotaxin, Th2 cytokine 
and IgE production in vitro and in vivo.
METHOD: This study comprehensively evaluates the potential therapeutic and 
immunological mechanisms underlying DHF improvement of symptoms related to EoE 
using computational modeling, including target mining, gene ontology enrichment, 
pathway analyses, protein-protein interaction analyses, in silico molecular 
docking and dynamic simulation followed by ex-vivo target validation by qRT-PCR 
using cultured human esophagus biopsy specimen with or without DHF from patients 
with EoE.
RESULTS: Computational analyses defined 29 common targets of DHF on EoE, among 
which TNF-α, IL-6, IL1β, MAPK1, MAPK3 and AKT1 were most important. Docking 
analysis and dynamic simulation revealed that DHF directly binds TNF-α with a 
free binding energy of -7.7 kcal/mol with greater stability and flexibility. 
Subsequently, in the human esophagus biopsy culture system, significant 
reduction in levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL1-β was found in the supernatant 
of biopsy sample cultured with DHF. Furthermore, the gene expression profile 
showed significant reduction in levels of TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6, CCND and MAPK1 in 
the esophagus biopsy sample cultured with DHF.
DISCUSSION: Taken together, the current study provides us an insight into the 
molecular mechanisms underlying multi-targeted benefits of DHF in the treatment 
of EoE and paves the way for facilitating more effective EoE therapies.

Background: Severe spermatogenic failure (SPGF) represents one of the most 
relevant causes of male infertility. This pathological condition can lead to 
extreme abnormalities in the seminal sperm count, such as severe oligozoospermia 
(SO) or non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Most cases of SPGF have an unknown 
aetiology, and it is known that this idiopathic form of male infertility 
represents a complex condition. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether 
common genetic variation in TEX15, which encodes a key player in 
spermatogenesis, is involved in the susceptibility to idiopathic SPGF. Materials 
and Methods: We designed a genetic association study comprising a total of 727 
SPGF cases (including 527 NOA and 200 SO) and 1,058 unaffected men from the 
Iberian Peninsula. Following a tagging strategy, three tag single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) of TEX15 (rs1362912, rs323342, and rs323346) were selected 
for genotyping using TaqMan probes. Case-control association tests were then 
performed by logistic regression models. In silico analyses were also carried 
out to shed light into the putative functional implications of the studied 
variants. Results: A significant increase in TEX15-rs1362912 minor allele 
frequency (MAF) was observed in the group of SO patients (MAF = 0.0842) compared 
to either the control cohort (MAF = 0.0468, OR = 1.90, p = 7.47E-03) or the NOA 
group (MAF = 0.0472, OR = 1.83, p = 1.23E-02). The genotype distribution of the 
SO population was also different from those of both control (p = 1.14E-02) and 
NOA groups (p = 4.33-02). The analysis of functional annotations of the human 
genome suggested that the effect of the SO-associated TEX15 variants is likely 
exerted by alteration of the binding affinity of crucial transcription factors 
for spermatogenesis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that common variation in 
TEX15 is involved in the genetic predisposition to SO, thus supporting the 
notion of idiopathic SPGF as a complex trait.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (anti-TNFs) represent a cornerstone of 
the treatment of various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and are among the 
most commercially successful therapeutic agents. Knowledge of TNF binding 
partners is critical for identification of the factors able to affect clinical 
efficacy of the anti-TNFs. Here, we report that among eighteen representatives 
of the multifunctional S100 protein family, only S100A11, S100A12 and S100A13 
interact with the soluble form of TNF (sTNF) in vitro. The lowest equilibrium 
dissociation constants (Kd) for the complexes with monomeric sTNF determined 
using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy range from 2 nM to 28 nM. The 
apparent Kd values for the complexes of multimeric sTNF with S100A11/A12 
estimated from fluorimetric titrations are 0.1-0.3 µM. S100A12/A13 suppress the 
cytotoxic activity of sTNF against Huh-7 cells, as evidenced by the MTT assay. 
Structural modeling indicates that the sTNF-S100 interactions may interfere with 
the sTNF recognition by the therapeutic anti-TNFs. Bioinformatics analysis 
reveals dysregulation of TNF and S100A11/A12/A13 in numerous disorders. Overall, 
we have shown a novel potential regulatory role of the extracellular forms of 
specific S100 proteins that may affect the efficacy of anti-TNF treatment in 
various diseases.

BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a 
debilitating chronic disease that lacks known pathogenesis, distinctive 
diagnostic criteria, and effective treatment options. Understanding the genetic 
(and other) risk factors associated with the disease would begin to help to 
alleviate some of these issues for patients.
METHODS: We applied both GWAS and the PrecisionLife combinatorial analytics 
platform to analyze ME/CFS cohorts from UK Biobank, including the Pain 
Questionnaire cohort, in a case-control design with 1000 cycles of fully random 
permutation. Results from this study were supported by a series of replication 
and cohort comparison experiments, including use of disjoint Verbal Interview 
CFS, post-viral fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia cohorts also derived from UK 
Biobank, and compared results for overlap and reproducibility.
RESULTS: Combinatorial analysis revealed 199 SNPs mapping to 14 genes that were 
significantly associated with 91% of the cases in the ME/CFS population. These 
SNPs were found to stratify by shared cases into 15 clusters (communities) made 
up of 84 high-order combinations of between 3 and 5 SNPs. p-values for these 
communities range from 2.3 × 10-10 to 1.6 × 10-72. Many of the genes identified 
are linked to the key cellular mechanisms hypothesized to underpin ME/CFS, 
including vulnerabilities to stress and/or infection, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
sleep disturbance and autoimmune development. We identified 3 of the critical 
SNPs replicated in the post-viral fatigue syndrome cohort and 2 SNPs replicated 
in the fibromyalgia cohort. We also noted similarities with genes associated 
with multiple sclerosis and long COVID, which share some symptoms and 
potentially a viral infection trigger with ME/CFS.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first detailed genetic insights into the 
pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning ME/CFS and offers new approaches for 
better diagnosis and treatment of patients.

Obesity is a significant risk factor for several chronic non-communicable 
diseases, being closely related to Diabetes Mellitus. Computer modeling 
techniques favor the understanding of interaction mechanisms between specific 
targets and substances of interest, optimizing drug development. In this 
article, the protocol of two protocols of systematic reviews are described for 
identifying therapeutic targets and models for treating obesity or diabetes 
mellitus investigated in silico. The protocol is by the guidelines from the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes Protocols 
(PRISMA-P) and was published in the International Prospective Register of 
Systematic Reviews database (PROSPERO: CRD42022353808). Search strategies will 
be developed based on the combination of descriptors and executed in the 
following databases: PubMed; ScienceDirect; Scopus; Web of Science; Virtual 
Health Library; EMBASE. Only original in silico studies with molecular dynamics, 
molecular docking, or both will be inserted. Two trained researchers will 
independently select the articles, extract the data, and assess the risk of 
bias. The quality will be assessed through an adapted version of the 
Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) and the 
risk of bias using a checklist obtained from separate literature sources. The 
implementation of this protocol will result in the elaboration of two systematic 
reviews identifying the therapeutic targets for treating obesity (review 1) or 
diabetes mellitus (review 2) used in computer simulation studies and their 
models. The systematization of knowledge about these treatment targets and their 
in silico structures is fundamental, primarily because computer simulation 
contributes to more accurate planning of future either in vitro or in vivo 
studies. Therefore, the reviews developed from this protocol will guide 
decision-making regarding the choice of targets/models in future research 
focused on therapeutics of obesity or Diabetes Mellitus contributing to mitigate 
of factors such as costs, time, and necessity of in vitro and/or in vivo assays.

BACKGROUND: Activated cardiac fibroblasts (CF) play a central role in cardiac 
fibrosis, a condition associated with most cardiovascular diseases. Conversion 
of quiescent into activated CF sustains heart integrity upon injury. However, 
permanence of CF in active state inflicts deleterious heart function effects. 
Mechanisms underlying this cell state conversion are still not fully disclosed, 
contributing to a limited target space and lack of effective anti-fibrotic 
therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To prioritize targets for drug development, we studied CF 
remodeling upon activation at transcriptomic and proteomic levels, using three 
different cell sources: primary adult CF (aHCF), primary fetal CF (fHCF), and 
induced pluripotent stem cells derived CF (hiPSC-CF).
RESULTS: All cell sources showed a convergent response upon activation, with 
clear morphological and molecular remodeling associated with cell-cell and 
cell-matrix interactions. Quantitative proteomic analysis identified known 
cardiac fibrosis markers, such as FN1, CCN2, and Serpine1, but also revealed 
targets not previously associated with this condition, including MRC2, IGFBP7, 
and NT5DC2.
CONCLUSION: Exploring such targets to modulate CF phenotype represents a 
valuable opportunity for development of anti-fibrotic therapies. Also, we 
demonstrate that hiPSC-CF is a suitable cell source for preclinical research, 
displaying significantly lower basal activation level relative to primary cells, 
while being able to elicit a convergent response upon stimuli.

Successful drug discovery is like finding oases of safety and efficacy in 
chemical and biological deserts. Screens in disease models, and other decision 
tools used in drug research and development (R&D), point towards oases when they 
score therapeutic candidates in a way that correlates with clinical utility in 
humans. Otherwise, they probably lead in the wrong direction. This line of 
thought can be quantified by using decision theory, in which 'predictive 
validity' is the correlation coefficient between the output of a decision tool 
and clinical utility across therapeutic candidates. Analyses based on this 
approach reveal that the detectability of good candidates is extremely sensitive 
to predictive validity, because the deserts are big and oases small. Both 
history and decision theory suggest that predictive validity is under-managed in 
drug R&D, not least because it is so hard to measure before projects succeed or 
fail later in the process. This article explains the influence of predictive 
validity on R&D productivity and discusses methods to evaluate and improve it, 
with the aim of supporting the application of more effective decision tools and 
catalysing investment in their creation.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a seronegative, chronic inflammatory arthritis 
with high genetic burden. A strong association with HLA-B27 has long been 
established, but to date its contribution to disease aetiology remains 
unresolved. Recent insights through genome wide studies reveal an increasing 
array of immunogenetic risk variants extraneous to the HLA complex in AS 
cohorts. These genetic traits build a complex profile of disease causality, 
highlighting several molecular pathways associated with the condition. This and 
other evidence strongly implicates T-cell-driven pathology, revolving around the 
T helper 17 cell subset as an important contributor to disease. This prominence 
of the T helper 17 cell subset has presented the opportunity for therapeutic 
intervention through inhibition of interleukins 17 and 23 which drive T helper 
17 activity. While targeting of interleukin 17 has proven effective, this 
success has not been replicated with interleukin 23 inhibition in AS patients. 
Evidence points to significant genetic diversity between AS patients which may, 
in part, explain the observed refractoriness among a proportion of patients. In 
this review we discuss the impact of genetics on our understanding of AS and its 
relationship with closely linked pathologies. We further explore how genetics 
can be used in the development of therapeutics and as a tool to assist in the 
diagnosis and management of patients. This evidence indicates that genetic 
profiling should play a role in the clinician's choice of therapy as part of a 
precision medicine strategy towards disease management.

Germinal center (GC) reaction greatly contributes to the humoral immune 
response, which begins in lymph nodes or other secondary lymphoid organs after 
follicular B cells are activated by T-dependent antigens. The GCs then serve as 
a platform for follicular B cells to complete clonal expansion and somatic 
hypermutation and then interact with follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and 
follicular helper T cells (Tfh). Through the interaction between the immune 
cells, significant processes of the humoral immune response are accomplished, 
such as antibody affinity maturation, class switching, and production of memory 
B cells and plasma cells. Cell positioning during the GC reaction is mainly 
mediated by the chemokine receptors and lipid receptors, which both belong to G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family. There are some orphan GPCRs whose 
endogenous ligands are unclear yet contribute to the regulation of GC reaction 
as well. This review will give an introduction on the ligands and functions of 
two types of GC-relating GPCRs-chemokine receptors like CXCR4 and CXCR5, as well 
as emerging de-orphanized GPCRs like GPR183, GPR174, and P2RY8. The roles these 
GPCRs play in several antibody-mediated autoimmune skin diseases will be also 
discussed, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pemphigus, scleroderma, 
and dermatomyositis. Besides, GPCRs are excellent drug targets due to the unique 
structure and vital functions. Therefore, this review is aimed at providing 
readers with a focused knowledge about the role that GPCRs play in GC reaction, 
as well as in provoking the development of GPCR-targeting agents for 
immune-mediated diseases besides autoimmune diseases.

While scientists can often infer the biological function of proteins from their 
3-dimensional quaternary structures, the gap between the number of known protein 
sequences and their experimentally determined structures keeps increasing. A 
potential solution to this problem is presented by ever more sophisticated 
computational protein modeling approaches. While often powerful on their own, 
most methods have strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, it benefits researchers 
to examine models from various model providers and perform comparative analysis 
to identify what models can best address their specific use cases. To make data 
from a large array of model providers more easily accessible to the broader 
scientific community, we established 3D-Beacons, a collaborative initiative to 
create a federated network with unified data access mechanisms. The 3D-Beacons 
Network allows researchers to collate coordinate files and metadata for 
experimentally determined and theoretical protein models from state-of-the-art 
and specialist model providers and also from the Protein Data Bank.

In recent years, a growing interest in the characterization of the molecular 
basis of psoriasis has been observed. However, despite the availability of a 
large amount of molecular data, many pathogenic mechanisms of psoriasis are 
still poorly understood. In this study, we performed an integrated analysis of 
23 public transcriptomic datasets encompassing both lesional and uninvolved skin 
samples from psoriasis patients. We defined comprehensive gene co-expression 
network models of psoriatic lesions and uninvolved skin. Moreover, we curated 
and exploited a wide range of functional information from multiple public 
sources in order to systematically annotate the inferred networks. The 
integrated analysis of transcriptomics data and co-expression networks 
highlighted genes that are frequently dysregulated and show aberrant patterns of 
connectivity in the psoriatic lesion compared with the unaffected skin. Our 
approach allowed us to also identify plausible, previously unknown, actors in 
the expression of the psoriasis phenotype. Finally, we characterized communities 
of co-expressed genes associated with relevant molecular functions and 
expression signatures of specific immune cell types associated with the 
psoriasis lesion. Overall, integrating experimental driven results with curated 
functional information from public repositories represents an efficient approach 
to empower knowledge generation about psoriasis and may be applicable to other 
complex diseases.

The druggability of targets is a crucial consideration in drug target selection. 
Here, we adopt a stochastic semi-supervised ML framework to develop DrugnomeAI, 
which estimates the druggability likelihood for every protein-coding gene in the 
human exome. DrugnomeAI integrates gene-level properties from 15 sources 
resulting in 324 features. The tool generates exome-wide predictions based on 
labelled sets of known drug targets (median AUC: 0.97), highlighting features 
from protein-protein interaction networks as top predictors. DrugnomeAI provides 
generic as well as specialised models stratified by disease type or drug 
therapeutic modality. The top-ranking DrugnomeAI genes were significantly 
enriched for genes previously selected for clinical development programs (p 
value < 1 × 10-308) and for genes achieving genome-wide significance in 
phenome-wide association studies of 450 K UK Biobank exomes for binary (p 
value = 1.7 × 10-5) and quantitative traits (p value = 1.6 × 10-7). We accompany 
our method with a web application ( http://drugnomeai.public.cgr.astrazeneca.com 
) to visualise the druggability predictions and the key features that define 
gene druggability, per disease type and modality.

BACKGROUND: In recent decades, increasing longevity (among other factors) has 
fostered a rise in Parkinson's disease incidence. Although not exhaustively 
studied in this devastating disease, the impact of sex represents a critical 
variable in Parkinson's disease as epidemiological and clinical features differ 
between males and females.
METHODS: To study sex bias in Parkinson's disease, we conducted a systematic 
review to select sex-labeled transcriptomic data from three relevant brain 
tissues: the frontal cortex, the striatum, and the substantia nigra. We 
performed differential expression analysis on each study chosen. Then we 
summarized the individual differential expression results with three 
tissue-specific meta-analyses and a global all-tissues meta-analysis. Finally, 
results from the meta-analysis were functionally characterized using different 
functional profiling approaches.
RESULTS: The tissue-specific meta-analyses linked Parkinson's disease to the 
enhanced expression of MED31 in the female frontal cortex and the dysregulation 
of 237 genes in the substantia nigra. The global meta-analysis detected 15 genes 
with sex-differential patterns in Parkinson's disease, which participate in 
mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, neuronal degeneration, and cell death. 
Furthermore, functional analyses identified pathways, protein-protein 
interaction networks, and transcription factors that differed by sex. While male 
patients exhibited changes in oxidative stress based on metal ions, 
inflammation, and angiogenesis, female patients exhibited dysfunctions in 
mitochondrial and lysosomal activity, antigen processing and presentation 
functions, and glutamic and purine metabolism. All results generated during this 
study are readily available by accessing an open web resource ( 
http://bioinfo.cipf.es/metafun-pd/ ) for consultation and reuse in further 
studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our in silico approach has highlighted sex-based differential 
mechanisms in typical Parkinson Disease hallmarks (inflammation, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and oxidative stress). Additionally, we have identified specific 
genes and transcription factors for male and female Parkinson Disease patients 
that represent potential candidates as biomarkers to diagnosis.

We performed collapsing analyses on 454,796 UK Biobank (UKB) exomes to detect 
gene-level associations with diabetes. Recessive carriers of nonsynonymous 
variants in MAP3K15 were 30% less likely to develop diabetes (P = 5.7 × 10-10) 
and had lower glycosylated hemoglobin (β = -0.14 SD units, P = 1.1 × 10-24). 
These associations were independent of body mass index, suggesting protection 
against insulin resistance even in the setting of obesity. We replicated these 
findings in 96,811 Admixed Americans in the Mexico City Prospective Study (P < 
0.05)Moreover, the protective effect of MAP3K15 variants was stronger in 
individuals who did not carry the Latino-enriched SLC16A11 risk haplotype (P = 
6.0 × 10-4). Separately, we identified a Finnish-enriched MAP3K15 
protein-truncating variant associated with decreased odds of both type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes (P < 0.05) in FinnGen. No adverse phenotypes were associated 
with protein-truncating MAP3K15 variants in the UKB, supporting this gene as a 
therapeutic target for diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Skull-base chordomas are rare malignant bone cancers originating 
from the remnant of the notochord. Survival is variable, and clinical or 
molecular factors cannot reliably predict their outcomes. This study therefore 
identified epigenetic subtypes that defined new chordoma epigenetic profiles and 
their corresponding characteristics.
METHODS: Methylation profiles of 46 chordoma-resected neoplasms between 2008 and 
2014, along with clinical information, were collected. K-means consensus 
clustering and principal component analysis were used to identify and validate 
the clusters. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, methylCIBERSORT 
algorithm, and copy number analysis were used to identify the characteristics of 
the clusters.
RESULTS: Unsupervised clustering analysis confirmed two clusters with a 
progression-free survival difference. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated 
that the early and late estrogen response pathways and the hypoxia pathway were 
activated whereas the inflammatory and interferon gamma responses were 
suppressed. Forty-six potential therapeutic targets corresponding to 
differentially methylated sites were identified from chordoma patients. 
Subgroups with a worse outcome were characterized by low immune cell 
infiltration, higher tumor purity, and higher stemness indices. Moreover, copy 
number amplifications mostly occurred in cluster 1 tumors and the high-risk 
group. Additionally, the presence of a CCNE1 deletion was exclusively found in 
the group of chordoma patients with better outcome, whereas RB1 and CDKN2A/2B 
deletions were mainly found in the group of chordoma patients with worse 
outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Chordoma prognostic epigenetic subtypes were identified, and their 
corresponding characteristics were found to be variable.

Proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) shows value in prioritizing drug 
targets in Europeans but with limited evidence in other ancestries. Here, we 
present a multi-ancestry proteome-wide MR analysis based on cross-population 
data from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI). We estimated the 
putative causal effects of 1,545 proteins on eight diseases in African (32,658) 
and European (1,219,993) ancestries and identified 45 and 7 protein-disease 
pairs with MR and genetic colocalization evidence in the two ancestries, 
respectively. A multi-ancestry MR comparison identified two protein-disease 
pairs with MR evidence in both ancestries and seven pairs with specific effects 
in the two ancestries separately. Integrating these MR signals with clinical 
trial evidence, we prioritized 16 pairs for investigation in future drug trials. 
Our results highlight the value of proteome-wide MR in informing the 
generalizability of drug targets for disease prevention across ancestries and 
illustrate the value of meta-analysis of biobanks in drug development.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miR) have proven to be promising biomarkers for several 
diseases due to their diverse functions, stability and tissue/organ-specific 
nature. Identification of new markers with high sensitivity and specificity will 
help in risk reduction in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with chest 
pain and also prevent future adverse outcomes. Hence the aim of this study was 
to perform a detailed in silico analysis for identifying the mechanistic role of 
miRs involved in the pathogenesis/prognosis of AMI for prospective evaluation in 
AMI patients.
METHODS: miR profiling data was extracted from GSE148153 and GSE24591 datasets 
using the GEO2R gene expression omnibus repository and analyzed using limma 
algorithm. Differentially expressed miRs were obtained by comparing MI patients 
with corresponding controls after multiple testing corrections. Data mining for 
identifying candidate miRs from published literature was also performed. Target 
prediction and gene enrichment was done using standard bioinformatics tools. 
Disease specific analysis was performed to identify target genes specific for 
AMI using open targets platform. Protein-protein interaction and pathway 
analysis was done using STRING database and Cytoscape platform.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The analysis revealed significant miRs like let-7b-5p, 
let-7c-5p, miR-4505, and miR-342-3p in important functions/pathways including 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT and the mammalian target of rapamycin, 
advanced glycation end products and its receptor and 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by directly targeting angiotensin II 
receptor type 1, forkhead box protein O1, etc. With this approach we were able 
to prioritize the miR candidates for a prospective clinical association study in 
AMI patients of south Indian origin.

Aqueous humor (AH) can be easily and safely used to evaluate disease-specific 
biomarkers in ocular disease. The aim of this study was to identify specific 
proteins biomarkers in the AH of retinoblastoma (RB) patients at various stages 
of the disease. We analyzed the proteome of 53 AH samples using high-resolution 
mass spectrometry. We grouped the samples according to active vitreous seeding 
(Group 1), active aqueous seeding (Group 2), naive RB (group 3), inactive RB 
(group 4), and congenital cataracts as the control (Group 5). We found a total 
of 889 proteins in all samples. Comparative parametric analyses among the 
different groups revealed three additional proteins expressed in the RB groups 
that were not expressed in the control group. These were histone H2B type 2-E 
(HISTH2B2E), InaD-like protein (PATJ), and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 V1 
(UBE2V1). Upon processing the data of our study with the OpenTarget Tool 
software, we found that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 
CD44 were more highly expressed in the RB groups. Our results provide a proteome 
database regarding AH related to RB disease that may be used as a source of 
biomarkers. Further prospective studies should validate our finding in a large 
cohort of RB patients.

Psoriasis and coronary artery disease (CAD) are related comorbidities that are 
well established, but whether a genetic basis underlies this is not well 
studied. We apply trans-disease meta-analysis to 11,024 psoriasis and 60,801 CAD 
cases, along with their associated controls, identifying one opposing and three 
shared genetic loci, which are confirmed through colocalization analysis. 
Combining results from Bayesian credible interval analysis with independent 
information from genomic, epigenomic, and spatial chromatin organization, we 
prioritize genes (including IFIH1 and IL23A) that have implications for common 
molecular mechanisms involved in psoriasis and CAD inflammatory signaling. 
Chronic systemic inflammation has been associated with CAD and myocardial 
infarction, and Mendelian randomization analysis finds that CAD as an exposure 
can have a significant causal effect on psoriasis (OR = 1.11; p = 3×10-6) 
following adjustment for BMI and waist-hip ratio. Together, these findings 
suggest that systemic inflammation which causes CAD can increase the risk of 
psoriasis.

Reading and writing are crucial life skills but roughly one in ten children are 
affected by dyslexia, which can persist into adulthood. Family studies of 
dyslexia suggest heritability up to 70%, yet few convincing genetic markers have 
been found. Here we performed a genome-wide association study of 51,800 adults 
self-reporting a dyslexia diagnosis and 1,087,070 controls and identified 42 
independent genome-wide significant loci: 15 in genes linked to cognitive 
ability/educational attainment, and 27 new and potentially more specific to 
dyslexia. We validated 23 loci (13 new) in independent cohorts of Chinese and 
European ancestry. Genetic etiology of dyslexia was similar between sexes, and 
genetic covariance with many traits was found, including ambidexterity, but not 
neuroanatomical measures of language-related circuitry. Dyslexia polygenic 
scores explained up to 6% of variance in reading traits, and might in future 
contribute to earlier identification and remediation of dyslexia.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of stroke - the second leading 
cause of death worldwide - were conducted predominantly in populations of 
European ancestry1,2. Here, in cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses of 110,182 
patients who have had a stroke (five ancestries, 33% non-European) and 1,503,898 
control individuals, we identify association signals for stroke and its subtypes 
at 89 (61 new) independent loci: 60 in primary inverse-variance-weighted 
analyses and 29 in secondary meta-regression and multitrait analyses. On the 
basis of internal cross-ancestry validation and an independent follow-up in 
89,084 additional cases of stroke (30% non-European) and 1,013,843 control 
individuals, 87% of the primary stroke risk loci and 60% of the secondary stroke 
risk loci were replicated (P < 0.05). Effect sizes were highly correlated across 
ancestries. Cross-ancestry fine-mapping, in silico mutagenesis analysis3, and 
transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association analyses revealed putative 
causal genes (such as SH3PXD2A and FURIN) and variants (such as at GRK5 and 
NOS3). Using a three-pronged approach4, we provide genetic evidence for putative 
drug effects, highlighting F11, KLKB1, PROC, GP1BA, LAMC2 and VCAM1 as possible 
targets, with drugs already under investigation for stroke for F11 and PROC. A 
polygenic score integrating cross-ancestry and ancestry-specific stroke GWASs 
with vascular-risk factor GWASs (integrative polygenic scores) strongly 
predicted ischaemic stroke in populations of European, East Asian and African 
ancestry5. Stroke genetic risk scores were predictive of ischaemic stroke 
independent of clinical risk factors in 52,600 clinical-trial participants with 
cardiometabolic disease. Our results provide insights to inform biology, reveal 
potential drug targets and derive genetic risk prediction tools across 
ancestries.

The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented global healthcare emergency 
prompting the exploration of new therapeutic avenues, including drug 
repurposing. A large number of ongoing studies revealed pervasive issues in 
clinical research, such as the lack of accessible and organised data. Moreover, 
current shortcomings in clinical studies highlighted the need for a 
multi-faceted approach to tackle this health crisis. Thus, we set out to explore 
and develop new strategies for drug repositioning by employing computational 
pharmacology, data mining, systems biology, and computational chemistry to 
advance shared efforts in identifying key targets, affected networks, and 
potential pharmaceutical intervention options. Our study revealed that 
formulating pharmacological strategies should rely on both therapeutic targets 
and their networks. We showed how data mining can reveal regulatory patterns, 
capture novel targets, alert about side-effects, and help identify new 
therapeutic avenues. We also highlighted the importance of the miRNA regulatory 
layer and how this information could be used to monitor disease progression or 
devise treatment strategies. Importantly, our work bridged the interactome with 
the chemical compound space to better understand the complex landscape of 
COVID-19 drugs. Machine and deep learning allowed us to showcase limitations in 
current chemical libraries for COVID-19 suggesting that both in silico and 
experimental analyses should be combined to retrieve therapeutically valuable 
compounds. Based on the gathered data, we strongly advocate for taking this 
opportunity to establish robust practices for treating today's and future 
infectious diseases by preparing solid analytical frameworks.

Genomics-driven drug discovery is indispensable for accelerating the development 
of novel therapeutic targets. However, the drug discovery framework based on 
evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has not been established, 
especially for cross-population GWAS meta-analysis. Here, we introduce a 
practical guideline for genomics-driven drug discovery for cross-population 
meta-analysis, as lessons from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative 
(GBMI). Our drug discovery framework encompassed three methodologies and was 
applied to the 13 common diseases targeted by GBMI (N mean = 1,329,242). 
Individual methodologies complementarily prioritized drugs and drug targets, 
which were systematically validated by referring previously known drug-disease 
relationships. Integration of the three methodologies provided a comprehensive 
catalog of candidate drugs for repositioning, nominating promising drug 
candidates targeting the genes involved in the coagulation process for venous 
thromboembolism and the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling pathway for 
gout. Our study highlighted key factors for successful genomics-driven drug 
discovery using cross-population meta-analyses.

Recent advances in RNA engineering have enabled the development of RNA-based 
therapeutics for a broad spectrum of applications. Developing RNA therapeutics 
start with targeted RNA screening and move to the drug design and optimization. 
However, existing target screening tools ignore noncoding RNAs and their 
disease-relevant regulatory relationships. And designing therapeutic RNAs 
encounters high computational complexity of multi-objective optimization to 
overcome the immunogenicity, instability and inefficient translational 
production. To unlock the therapeutic potential of noncoding RNAs and enable 
one-stop screening and design of therapeutic RNAs, we have built the platform 
TREAT. It incorporates 43,087,953 regulatory relationships between coding and 
noncoding genes from 81 biological networks under different physiological 
conditions. TREAT introduces graph representation learning with Random Walk 
Diffusions to perform disease-relevant target screening, in addition to the 
commonly utilized Topological Degree and PageRank algorithms. Design and 
optimization of large RNAs or interfering RNAs are both available. To reduce the 
computational complexity of multi-objective optimization for large RNA, we 
stratified the features into local and global features. The local features are 
evaluated on the fixed-length or dynamic-length local bins, whereas the latter 
are inspired by AI language models of protein sequence. Then the global 
assessment is performed on refined candidates, thus reducing the enormous search 
space. Overall, TREAT is a one-stop platform for the screening and designing of 
therapeutic RNAs, with particular attention to noncoding RNAs and cutting-edge 
AI technology embedded, leading the progress of innovative therapeutics for 
challenging diseases. TREAT is freely accessible at https://rna.org.cn/treat.

Opioid addiction (OA) is moderately heritable, yet only rs1799971, the A118G 
variant in OPRM1, has been identified as a genome-wide significant association 
with OA and independently replicated. We applied genomic structural equation 
modeling to conduct a GWAS of the new Genetics of Opioid Addiction Consortium 
(GENOA) data together with published studies (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 
Million Veteran Program, and Partners Health), comprising 23,367 cases and 
effective sample size of 88,114 individuals of European ancestry. Genetic 
correlations among the various OA phenotypes were uniformly high (rg > 0.9). We 
observed the strongest evidence to date for OPRM1: lead SNP rs9478500 
(p = 2.56 × 10-9). Gene-based analyses identified novel genome-wide significant 
associations with PPP6C and FURIN. Variants within these loci appear to be 
pleiotropic for addiction and related traits.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of 
lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) during cancer development. 
However, the abnormal expression and prognostic significance of pan-cancer have 
not been determined.
METHODS: We explored the expression level and prognostic value of LPCAT3 in 33 
cancers by bioinformatics techniques, and comprehensively studied the biological 
function and immune infiltration based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases as well as many online websites.
RESULTS: LPCAT3 is significantly upregulated in many cancers, and it is 
associated with prognosis. Pan-cancer Cox regression analysis indicated that the 
high expression of LPCAT3 was associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML), lower-grade glioma (LGG), ovarian cancer (OV), and uveal 
melanoma (UVM), while better prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma 
(KIRC) (all P<0.05). Further analysis indicated that higher LPCAT3 expression in 
most cancers markedly decreased the infiltration of immune cells, except diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC), AML, LGG, stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and UVM. 
In contrast, the expression level of LPCAT3 was positively correlated with most 
immune checkpoints in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), DLBC, LGG, liver 
hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and UVM. Additionally, LPCAT3 expression was 
associated with tumor mutational burden (TMB) in 4 cancer types, while 
microsatellite instability (MSI) was in 3 cancer types. Functional enrichment 
analysis showed LPCAT3 upregulation was highly associated with lipid metabolism 
and ferroptosis processes. In addition, the result of prediction drug response 
suggested that B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors and Midostaurin may be a 
potential treatment option for AML with low-LPCAT3 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: LPCAT3 expression is increased in multiple cancers. Overexpression 
of LPCAT3 is associated with poor prognosis and tumor immune microenvironment in 
many cancers, especially in AML. Our results showed that the oncogene of LPCAT3 
may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and/or therapeutic target in AML 
patients.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unique insights into the 
pathology and cellular origin of disease. We introduce single-cell disease 
relevance score (scDRS), an approach that links scRNA-seq with polygenic disease 
risk at single-cell resolution, independent of annotated cell types. scDRS 
identifies cells exhibiting excess expression across disease-associated genes 
implicated by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We applied scDRS to 74 
diseases/traits and 1.3 million single-cell gene-expression profiles across 31 
tissues/organs. Cell-type-level results broadly recapitulated known 
cell-type-disease associations. Individual-cell-level results identified 
subpopulations of disease-associated cells not captured by existing cell-type 
labels, including T cell subpopulations associated with inflammatory bowel 
disease, partially characterized by their effector-like states; neuron 
subpopulations associated with schizophrenia, partially characterized by their 
spatial locations; and hepatocyte subpopulations associated with triglyceride 
levels, partially characterized by their higher ploidy levels. Genes whose 
expression was correlated with the scDRS score across cells (reflecting 
coexpression with GWAS disease-associated genes) were strongly enriched for 
gold-standard drug target and Mendelian disease genes.

The concept of the druggable genome has been with us for 20 years. During this 
time, researchers have developed several methods and resources to help assess a 
target's druggability. In parallel, evidence for target-disease associations has 
been collated at scale by Open Targets. More recently, the Protein Data Bank in 
Europe (PDBe) have built a knowledge base matching per-residue annotations with 
available protein structure. While each resource is useful in isolation, we 
believe there is enormous potential in bringing all relevant data into a single 
knowledge graph, from gene-level to protein residue. Automation is vital for the 
processing and assessment of all available structures. We have developed 
scalable, automated workflows that provide hotspot-based druggability 
assessments for all available structures across large numbers of targets. 
Ultimately, we will run our method at a proteome scale, an ambition made more 
realistic by the arrival of AlphaFold 2. Bringing together annotations from the 
residue up to the gene level and building connections within the graph to 
represent pathways or protein-protein interactions will create complexity that 
mirrors the biological systems they represent. Such complexity is difficult for 
the human mind to utilise effectively, particularly at scale. We believe that 
graph-based AI methods will be able to expertly navigate such a knowledge graph, 
selecting the targets of the future.

BACKGROUND: Clinical classification of autistic patients based on current WHO 
criteria provides a valuable but simplified depiction of the true nature of the 
disorder. Our goal is to determine the biology of the disorder and the 
ASD-associated genes that lead to differences in the severity and variability of 
clinical features, which can enhance the ability to predict clinical outcomes.
METHOD: Novel Whole Exome Sequencing data from children (n = 33) with ASD were 
collected along with extended cognitive and linguistic assessments. A machine 
learning methodology and a literature-based approach took into consideration 
known effects of genetic variation on the translated proteins, linking them with 
specific ASD clinical manifestations, namely non-verbal IQ, memory, attention 
and oral language deficits.
RESULTS: Linear regression polygenic risk score results included the 
classification of severe and mild ASD samples with a 81.81% prediction accuracy. 
The literature-based approach revealed 14 genes present in all sub-phenotypes 
(independent of severity) and others which seem to impair individual ones, 
highlighting genetic profiles specific to mild and severe ASD, which concern 
non-verbal IQ, memory, attention and oral language skills.
CONCLUSIONS: These genes can potentially contribute toward a diagnostic gene-set 
for determining ASD severity. However, due to the limited number of patients in 
this study, our classification approach is mostly centered on the prediction and 
verification of these genes and does not hold a diagnostic nature per se. 
Substantial further experimentation is required to validate their role as 
diagnostic markers. The use of these genes as input for functional analysis 
highlights important biological processes and bridges the gap between genotype 
and phenotype in ASD.

Artificial intelligence (AI), currently a cutting-edge concept, has the 
potential to improve the quality of life of human beings. The fields of AI and 
biological research are becoming more intertwined, and methods for extracting 
and applying the information stored in live organisms are constantly being 
refined. As the field of AI matures with more trained algorithms, the potential 
of its application in epidemiology, the study of host-pathogen interactions and 
drug designing widens. AI is now being applied in several fields of drug 
discovery, customized medicine, gene editing, radiography, image processing and 
medication management. More precise diagnosis and cost-effective treatment will 
be possible in the near future due to the application of AI-based technologies. 
In the field of agriculture, farmers have reduced waste, increased output and 
decreased the amount of time it takes to bring their goods to market due to the 
application of advanced AI-based approaches. Moreover, with the use of AI 
through machine learning (ML) and deep-learning-based smart programs, one can 
modify the metabolic pathways of living systems to obtain the best possible 
outputs with the minimal inputs. Such efforts can improve the industrial strains 
of microbial species to maximize the yield in the bio-based industrial setup. 
This article summarizes the potentials of AI and their application to several 
fields of biology, such as medicine, agriculture, and bio-based industry.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) have been of great interest to scientists for a 
long time due to their multifactorial character. Among these pathologies, 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of special relevance, and despite the existence of 
approved drugs for its treatment, there is still no efficient pharmacological 
therapy to stop, slow, or repair neurodegeneration. Existing drugs have certain 
disadvantages, such as lack of efficacy and side effects. Therefore, there is a 
real need to discover new drugs that can deal with this problem. However, as AD 
is multifactorial in nature with so many physiological pathways involved, the 
most effective approach to modulate more than one of them in a relevant manner 
and without undesirable consequences is through polypharmacology. In this field, 
there has been significant progress in recent years in terms of 
pharmacoinformatics tools that allow the discovery of bioactive molecules with 
polypharmacological profiles without the need to spend a long time and excessive 
resources on complex experimental designs, making the drug design and 
development pipeline more efficient. In this review, we present from different 
perspectives how pharmacoinformatics tools can be useful when drug design 
programs are designed to tackle complex diseases such as AD, highlighting 
essential concepts, showing the relevance of artificial intelligence and new 
trends, as well as different databases and software with their main results, 
emphasizing the importance of coupling wet and dry approaches in drug design and 
development processes.

Biomedical data is accumulating at a fast pace and integrating it into a unified 
framework is a major challenge, so that multiple views of a given biological 
event can be considered simultaneously. Here we present the Bioteque, a resource 
of unprecedented size and scope that contains pre-calculated biomedical 
descriptors derived from a gigantic knowledge graph, displaying more than 450 
thousand biological entities and 30 million relationships between them. The 
Bioteque integrates, harmonizes, and formats data collected from over 150 data 
sources, including 12 biological entities (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs) linked 
by 67 types of associations (e.g., 'drug treats disease', 'gene interacts with 
gene'). We show how Bioteque descriptors facilitate the assessment of 
high-throughput protein-protein interactome data, the prediction of drug 
response and new repurposing opportunities, and demonstrate that they can be 
used off-the-shelf in downstream machine learning tasks without loss of 
performance with respect to using original data. The Bioteque thus offers a 
thoroughly processed, tractable, and highly optimized assembly of the biomedical 
knowledge available in the public domain.

Big Data pervades nearly all areas of life sciences, yet the analysis of large 
integrated data sets remains a major challenge. Moreover, the field of life 
sciences is highly fragmented and, consequently, so is its data, knowledge, and 
standards. This, in turn, makes integrated data analysis and knowledge gathering 
across sub-fields a demanding task. At the same time, the integration of various 
research angles and data types is crucial for modelling the complexity of 
organisms and biological processes in a holistic manner. This is especially 
valid in the context of drug development and chemical safety assessment where 
computational methods can provide solutions for the urgent need of fast, 
effective, and sustainable approaches. At the same time, such computational 
methods require the development of methodologies suitable for an integrated and 
data centred Big Data view. Here we discuss Knowledge Graphs (KG) as a solution 
to a data centred analysis approach for drug and chemical development and safety 
assessment. KGs are knowledge bases, data analysis engines, and knowledge 
discovery systems all in one, allowing them to be used from simple data 
retrieval, over meta-analysis to complex predictive and knowledge discovery 
systems. Therefore, KGs have immense potential to advance the data centred 
approach, the re-usability, and informativity of data. Furthermore, they can 
improve the power of analysis, and the complexity of modelled processes, all 
while providing knowledge in a natively human understandable network data model.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (CoV) disease (COVID-19) identified in Wuhan, China, in 
2019, is mainly characterized by atypical pneumonia and severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) and is caused by SARS CoV-2, which belongs to the Coronaviridae 
family. Determining the underlying disease mechanisms is central to the 
identification and development of COVID-19-specific drugs for effective 
treatment and prevention of human-to-human transmission, disease complications, 
and deaths.
METHODS: Here, next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) data were obtained using 
Illumina Next Seq 500 from SARS CoV-infected A549 cells and mock-treated A549 
cells from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE147507), and quality control 
(QC) was assessed before RNA Seq analysis using CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were imported into BioJupies to decipher 
COVID-19 induced signaling pathways and small molecules derived from chemical 
synthesis or natural sources to mimic or reverse COVID -19 specific gene 
signatures. In addition, iPathwayGuide was used to identify COVID-19-specific 
signaling pathways, as well as drugs and natural products with anti-COVID-19 
potential.
RESULTS: Here, we identified the potential activation of upstream regulators 
such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2), interferon 
regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), and interferon beta (IFNβ), interleukin-1 beta 
(IL-1β), and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). COVID-19 infection activated 
key infectious disease-specific immune-related signaling pathways such as 
influenza A, viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptors, 
measles, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and IL-17 signaling pathway. Besides, we 
identified drugs such as prednisolone, methylprednisolone, diclofenac, compound 
JQ1, and natural products such as Withaferin-A and JinFuKang as candidates for 
further experimental validation of COVID-19 therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have used the in silico next-generation knowledge 
discovery (NGKD) methods to discover COVID-19-associated pathways and specific 
therapeutics that have the potential to ameliorate the disease pathologies 
associated with COVID-19.

Phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) may be an oncogene that plays an 
important role in various cancer types. However, there are still many gaps in 
the expression of PSAT1 gene and its biological impact in different types of 
tumors. Here, we performed an integrated pan-cancer analysis to explore the 
potential molecular mechanisms of PSAT1 in cancers. We found that most human 
tumors express higher levels of PSAT1 than normal tissues, and that higher PSAT1 
expression is associated with worse prognosis in Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), 
Pan-kidney cohort (KIPAN) and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), etc. In BRCA 
cases, the prognosis of patients with altered PSAT1 was worse than that of 
patients without alteration. In addition, PSAT1 hypermethylation is associated 
with T cell dysfunction and shortened survival time in BRCA. The Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis showed that PSAT1 can be enriched into the 
classic signaling pathways of cancer such as mTORC1 signaling, MYC targets and 
JAK STAT3. Further analysis demonstrated that PSAT1 was enriched in immune 
related signaling pathways in LUAD and BRCA. The results of immunoassay showed 
that PSAT1 was associated with immune cell infiltration in multiple cancer 
species. Furthermore, expression of PSAT1 was correlated with both tumor 
mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) in BRCA. 
Additionally, a remarkable correlation was found between PSAT1 expression and 
TMB in LUAD, and the expression of PSAT1 was negatively correlated with the 
Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) value, suggesting a good effect of 
immunotherapy. Together, these data suggest that PSAT1 expression is associated 
with the clinical prognosis, DNA methylation, gene mutations, and immune cell 
infiltration, contributing to clarify the role of PSAT1 in tumorigenesis from a 
variety of perspectives. What's more, PSAT1 may be a new biomarker for survival 
and predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy for LUAD and BRCA.

Ren-Shen-Bai-Du Powder (RSBDP) is currently used for inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) therapy in China. However, its potential mechanism against IBD remains 
unknown. In this study, we initially identified potential targets of RSBDP 
against IBD through network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking. 
Afterwards, the DSS-induced colitis mice model was employed to assess the 
effects of RSBDP. The results of network pharmacology indicated that a total of 
39 main active ingredients in RSBDP generated 309 pairs of drug-ingredient and 
ingredient-target correspondences through 115 highly relevant targets of IBD. 
The primary ingredients (quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin, and 
sitosterol) exerted functions through multiple targets that include CYP1B1, 
CA4/7, and ESR1/2, etc. GO functional enrichment analysis revealed that the 
targets related to IBD were significantly enriched in the oxidation-reduction 
process, protein binding, and cytosol. Per the KEGG pathway analysis, pathways 
in cancer, adherens junction, and nitrogen metabolism were pivotal in the 
RSBDP’s treatment of IBD. Additionally, molecular docking demonstrated that a 
set of active ingredients and their targets displayed good bonding capabilities 
(e.g., kaempferol and AhR with combined energy < 5 kcal/mol). For the animal 
experiment, oral RSBDP promoted weight recovery, reduced intestinal 
inflammation, and decreased serum IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations in the DSS 
+ RSBDP group. Meanwhile, oral RSBDP significantly up-regulated the mRNA levels 
of CA7, CPY1B1, and PTPN11; in particular, the expression level of CYP1B1 in the 
DSS + RSBDP group was up-regulated by as high as 9-fold compared to the DSS 
group. Western blot results indicated that the protein levels of AKR1C1, PI3K, 
AKT, p-AKT, and Bcl-2 were significantly down-regulated, and Bax was 
significantly up-regulated in the DSS + RSBDP group. Compared to the DSS and 
control groups, the Bax/Bcl-2 value in the DSS + RSBDP group increased 4-fold 
and 8-fold, respectively, which suggested that oral RSBDP promotes apoptosis of 
intestinal epithelial cells. In short, this study established quercetin, 
kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin, and sitosterol as the primary key active 
ingredients of RSBDP that exert synergistic therapeutic effects against IBD 
through modulating the AhR/CYP1B1 and AKR1C1/PI3K/AKT pathways.

Diseases originate at the molecular-genetic layer, manifest through altered 
biochemical homeostasis, and develop symptoms later. Hence, symptomatic 
diagnosis is inadequate to explain the underlying molecular-genetic abnormality 
and individual genomic disparities. The current trends include molecular-genetic 
information relying on algorithms to recognize the disease subtypes through gene 
expressions. Despite their disposition toward disease-specific heterogeneity and 
cross-disease homogeneity, a gap still exists in describing the extent of 
homogeneity within the heterogeneous subpopulation of different diseases. They 
are limited to obtaining the holistic sense of the whole genome-based diagnosis 
resulting in inaccurate diagnosis and subsequent management. Addressing those 
ambiguities, our proposed framework, ReDisX, introduces a unique classification 
system for the patients based on their genomic signatures. In this study, it is 
a scalable machine learning algorithm deployed to re-categorize the patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis and coronary artery disease. It reveals heterogeneous 
subpopulations within a disease and homogenous subpopulations across different 
diseases. Besides, it identifies granzyme B (GZMB) as a 
subpopulation-differentiation marker that plausibly serves as a prominent 
indicator for GZMB-targeted drug repurposing. The ReDisX framework offers a 
novel strategy to redefine disease diagnosis through characterizing personalized 
genomic signatures. It may rejuvenate the landscape of precision and 
personalized diagnosis and a clue to drug repurposing.

Despite two years of intense global research activity, host genetic factors that 
predispose to a poorer prognosis of COVID-19 infection remain poorly understood. 
Here, we prioritise eight robust (e.g., ELF5) or suggestive but unreported 
(e.g., RAB2A) candidate protein mediators of COVID-19 outcomes by integrating 
results from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative with population-based plasma 
proteomics using statistical colocalisation. The transcription factor ELF5 
(ELF5) shows robust and directionally consistent associations across different 
outcome definitions, including a >4-fold higher risk (odds ratio: 4.88; 95%-CI: 
2.47-9.63; p-value < 5.0 × 10-6) for severe COVID-19 per 1 s.d. higher 
genetically predicted plasma ELF5. We show that ELF5 is specifically expressed 
in epithelial cells of the respiratory system, such as secretory and alveolar 
type 2 cells, using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. These 
cells are also likely targets of SARS-CoV-2 by colocalisation with key host 
factors, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In summary, large-scale human genetic 
studies together with gene expression at single-cell resolution highlight ELF5 
as a risk gene for severe COVID-19, supporting a role of epithelial cells of the 
respiratory system in the adverse host response to SARS-CoV-2.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent cause of mortality and morbidity. 
The molecular drivers of HF are still largely unknown.
RESULTS: We aimed to identify circulating proteins causally associated with HF 
by leveraging genome-wide genetic association data for HF including 47,309 cases 
and 930,014 controls. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with 
multiple cis instruments as well as network and enrichment analysis using data 
from blood protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) (2,965 blood proteins) 
measured in 3,301 individuals. Nineteen blood proteins were causally associated 
with HF, were not subject to reverse causality and were enriched in 
ligand-receptor and glycosylation molecules. Network pathway analysis of the 
blood proteins showed enrichment in NF-kappa B, TGF beta, lipid in 
atherosclerosis and fluid shear stress. Cross-phenotype analysis of HF 
identified genetic overlap with cardiovascular drugs, myocardial infarction, 
parental longevity and low-density cholesterol. Multi-trait MR identified causal 
associations between HF-associated blood proteins and cardiovascular outcomes. 
Multivariable MR showed that association of BAG3, MIF and APOA5 with HF were 
mediated by the blood pressure and coronary artery disease. According to the 
directional effect and biological action, 7 blood proteins are targets of 
existing drugs or are tractable for the development of novel therapeutics. Among 
the pathways, sialyl Lewis x and the activin type II receptor are potential 
druggable candidates.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrative MR analyses of the blood proteins identified 
causally-associated proteins with HF and revealed pleiotropy of the blood 
proteome with cardiovascular risk factors. Some of the proteins or pathway 
related mechanisms could be targeted as novel treatment approach in HF.

CD8A encodes the CD8 alpha chain of αβT cells, which has been proposed as a 
quantifiable indicator for the assessment of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) 
recruitment or activity and a robust biomarker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy 
responses. Nonetheless, the lack of research into the role of CD8A in tumor 
microenvironment predisposes to limitations in its clinical utilization. In the 
presented study, multiple computational tools were used to investigate the roles 
of CD8A in the pan-cancer study, revealing its essential associations with tumor 
immune infiltration, immunosuppressive environment formation, cancer 
progression, and therapy responses. Based on the pan-cancer cohorts of the 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, our results demonstrated the distinctive 
CD8A expression patterns in cancer tissues and its close associations with the 
prognosis and disease stage of cancer. We then found that CD8A was correlated 
with six major immune cell types, and immunosuppressive cells in multiple cancer 
types. Besides, epigenetic modifications of CD8A were related to CTL levels and 
T cell dysfunctional states, thereby affecting survival outcomes of specific 
cancer types. After that, we explored the co-occurrence patterns of CD8A 
mutation, thus identifying RMND5A, RNF103-CHMP3, CHMP3, CD8B, MRPL35, MAT2A, 
RGPD1, RGPD2, REEP1, and ANAPC1P1 genes, which co-occurred mutations with CD8A, 
and are concomitantly implicated in the regulation of cancer-related pathways. 
Finally, we tested CD8A as a therapeutic biomarker for multiple antitumor 
agents' or compounds' responsiveness on various cancer cell lines and cancer 
cohorts. Our findings denoted the underlying mechanics of CD8A in reflecting the 
T-cell-inflamed profiles, which has potential as a biomarker in cancer 
diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic responses.

Due to the explosion of cancer genome data and the urgent needs for cancer 
treatment, it is becoming increasingly important and necessary to easily and 
timely analyze and annotate cancer genomes. However, tumor heterogeneity is 
recognized as a serious barrier to annotate cancer genomes at the individual 
patient level. In addition, the interpretation and analysis of cancer 
multi-omics data rely heavily on existing database resources that are often 
located in different data centers or research institutions, which poses a huge 
challenge for data parsing. Here we present CCAS (Cancer genome Consensus 
Annotation System, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ccas/#/home), a one-stop and 
comprehensive annotation system for the individual patient at multi-omics level. 
CCAS integrates 20 widely recognized resources in the field to support data 
annotation of 10 categories of cancers covering 395 subtypes. Data from each 
resource are manually curated and standardized by using ontology frameworks. 
CCAS accepts data on single nucleotide variant/insertion or deletion, 
expression, copy number variation, and methylation level as input files to build 
a consensus annotation. Outputs are arranged in the forms of tables or figures 
and can be searched, sorted, and downloaded. Expanded panels with additional 
information are used for conciseness, and most figures are interactive to show 
additional information. Moreover, CCAS offers multidimensional annotation 
information, including mutation signature pattern, gene set enrichment analysis, 
pathways and clinical trial related information. These are helpful for 
intuitively understanding the molecular mechanisms of tumors and discovering key 
functional genes.

Discoidin, CUB, and LCCL domain-containing protein 2 (DCBLD2) is a two-domain 
transmembrane protein-coding gene located on chromosome 3, the protein expressed 
by which acts as the membrane receptor of semaphorin and vascular endothelial 
growth factor during the development of axons and blood vessels. Although 
several research evidences at the cellular and clinical levels have associated 
DCBLD2 with tumorigenesis, nothing is known regarding this gene from a 
pan-cancer standpoint. In this study, we systematically analyzed the influence 
of DCBLD2 on prognosis, cancer staging, immune characteristics, and drug 
sensitivity in a variety of cancers based on a unified and standardized 
pan-cancer dataset. In addition, we performed GO enrichment analyses and KEGG 
analyses of DCBLD2-related genes and DCBLD2-binding proteins. Our results showed 
that DCBLD2 is a potential oncogenic, immunological as well as a prognostic 
biomarker in terms of pan-cancer, and is expected to contribute to the 
improvement of tumor prognosis and the development of targeted therapy.

The aberrant protein disulfide isomerase A5 (PDIA5) expression was relevant to 
the poor prognosis of patients with human cancers. However, its relationship 
with the epigenetic and genetic alterations and its effect on tumor immunity is 
still lacking. In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed the immune 
infiltration role of PDIA5 in human cancers based on large-scale bioinformatics 
analyses and in vitro experiments. Obvious DNA methylation and moderate 
alteration frequency of PDIA5 were observed in human cancers. The expression 
level of PDIA5 was significantly correlated with infiltrated immune cells, 
immune pathways, and other immune signatures. We found that cancer cells and 
macrophages exhibited high PDIA5 expression in human cancers using the 
single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. We also demonstrated the interaction 
between PDIA5 and immune cells in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Multiplex 
immunofluorescence staining showed the upregulated expression level of PDIA5 and 
the increased number of M2 macrophage markers-CD163 positive cells in pan-cancer 
samples. Notably, PDIA5 silencing resulted in upregulated expression of PD-L1 
and SPP1 in U251 cells. Silencing of PDIA5 in hepG2 cells, U251 cells, and PC3 
cells contributed to a decline in their ability of proliferation, clone 
formation, and invasion and inhibited the migration of cocultured M2 
macrophages. Additionally, PDIA5 also displayed predictive value in the 
immunotherapy response of both murine and human cancer cohorts. Overall, our 
findings indicated that PDIA5 might be a potential target for immunotherapies in 
cancers.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a heterogeneous tumor made up of cell states that evolve 
over time. Here, we modeled tumor evolutionary trajectories during 
standard-of-care treatment using multi-omic single-cell analysis of a primary 
tumor sample, corresponding mouse xenografts subjected to standard of care 
therapy, and recurrent tumor at autopsy. We mined the multi-omic data with 
single-cell SYstems Genetics Network AnaLysis (scSYGNAL) to identify a network 
of 52 regulators that mediate treatment-induced shifts in xenograft tumor-cell 
states that were also reflected in recurrence. By integrating scSYGNAL-derived 
regulatory network information with transcription factor accessibility 
deviations derived from single-cell ATAC-seq data, we developed consensus 
networks that modulate cell state transitions across subpopulations of primary 
and recurrent tumor cells. Finally, by matching targeted therapies to active 
regulatory networks underlying tumor evolutionary trajectories, we provide a 
framework for applying single-cell-based precision medicine approaches to an 
individual patient in a concurrent, adjuvant, or recurrent setting.

BACKGROUND: CLEC5A is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily. It can activate 
macrophages and lead to a series of immune-inflammation reactions. Previous 
studies reveal the role of CLEC5A in infection and inflammation diseases.
METHOD: We acquire and analyze data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
database, Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, and other comprehensive 
databases via GSCALite, cBioPortal, and TIMER 2.0 platforms or software. 
Single-cell sequencing analysis was performed for quantifying the tumor 
microenvironment of several types of cancers.
RESULTS: CLEC5A is differentially expressed in a few cancer types, of which 
overexpression accompanies low overall survival of patients. DNA methylation 
mainly negatively correlates with CLEC5A expression. Moreover, CLEC5A is 
positively related to immune infiltration, including macrophages, 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Immune 
checkpoint genes are significantly associated with CLEC5A expression in diverse 
cancers. In addition, CLEC5A expression correlates with mismatch repair (MMR) in 
several cancers. Tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), 
and neoantigens show a positive association with CLEC5A expression in several 
cancers. Furthermore, CLEC5A in cancer correlates with signal transduction, the 
immune system, EMT, and apoptosis process. The drug sensitivity analysis screens 
out potential therapeutic agents associated with CLEC5A expression, including 
FR-180204, Tivozanib, OSI-930, Linifanib, AC220, VNLG/124, Bexarotene, 
omacetaxine mepesuccinate, narciclasine, leptomycin B, PHA-793887, LRRK2-IN-1, 
and CR-1-31B.
CONCLUSION: CLEC5A overexpresses in multiple cancers in contrast to normal 
tissues, and high CLEC5A expression predicts poor prognosis of patients and 
immune infiltration. CLEC5A is a potential prognostic biomarker of diverse 
cancers and a target for anti-tumor therapy.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the clonal expansion of a blood stem cell and its 
progeny driven by somatic driver mutations, affects over a third of people, yet 
remains poorly understood. Here we analyze genetic data from 200,453 UK Biobank 
participants to map the landscape of inherited predisposition to CH, increasing 
the number of germline associations with CH in European-ancestry populations 
from 4 to 14. Genes at new loci implicate DNA damage repair (PARP1, ATM, CHEK2), 
hematopoietic stem cell migration/homing (CD164) and myeloid oncogenesis 
(SETBP1). Several associations were CH-subtype-specific including variants at 
TCL1A and CD164 that had opposite associations with DNMT3A- versus TET2-mutant 
CH, the two most common CH subtypes, proposing key roles for these two loci in 
CH development. Mendelian randomization analyses showed that smoking and longer 
leukocyte telomere length are causal risk factors for CH and that genetic 
predisposition to CH increases risks of myeloproliferative neoplasia, 
nonhematological malignancies, atrial fibrillation and blood epigenetic ageing.

Gene regulatory networks ensure that important genes are expressed at precise 
levels. When gene expression is sufficiently perturbed, it can lead to disease. 
To understand how gene expression disruptions percolate through a network, we 
must first map connections between regulatory genes and their downstream 
targets. However, we lack comprehensive knowledge of the upstream regulators of 
most genes. Here, we developed an approach for systematic discovery of upstream 
regulators of critical immune factors-IL2RA, IL-2 and CTLA4-in primary human T 
cells. Then, we mapped the network of the target genes of these regulators and 
putative cis-regulatory elements using CRISPR perturbations, RNA-seq and 
ATAC-seq. These regulators form densely interconnected networks with extensive 
feedback loops. Furthermore, this network is enriched for immune-associated 
disease variants and genes. These results provide insight into how 
immune-associated disease genes are regulated in T cells and broader principles 
about the structure of human gene regulatory networks.

Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial tumor in children resulting 
in substantial morbidity and mortality. A deeper understanding of the NB tumor 
microenvironment (TME) remains an area of active research but there is a lack of 
reliable and biomimetic experimental models. This study utilizes a 3D 
bioprinting approach, in combination with NB spheroids, to create an in vitro 
vascular model of NB for exploring the tumor function within an endothelialized 
microenvironment. A gelatin methacryloyl (gelMA) bioink is used to create 
multi-channel cubic tumor analogues with high printing fidelity and mechanical 
tunability. Human-derived NB spheroids and human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (HUVECs) are incorporated into the biomanufactured gelMA and cocultured 
under static versus dynamic conditions, demonstrating high levels of survival 
and growth. Quantification of NB-EC integration and tumor cell migration 
suggested an increased aggressive behavior of NB when cultured in bioprinted 
endothelialized models, when cocultured with HUVECs, and also as a result of 
dynamic culture. This model also allowed for the assessment of metabolic, 
cytokine, and gene expression profiles of NB spheroids under varying TME 
conditions. These results establish a high throughput research enabling platform 
to study the TME-mediated cellular-molecular mechanisms of tumor growth, 
aggression, and response to therapy.

GnRH-I and GnIH are the key neuropeptides that regulate the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in mammals during aging. Polyamines are 
important aliphatic amines that are expressed in the brain and show variation 
with aging. The present study demonstrates evidence of variation in the level of 
expression of polyamines, GnRH-I and GnIH in the hypothalamus of female mice 
during aging. The study also suggests regulatory effects of polyamines over 
expression of the hypothalamic GnRH-I. The study shows a significant positive 
correlation between polyamines, its associated factors and GnRH-I along with 
significant negative correlation between polyamines, its associated factors and 
GnIH. This is the first study to report the effect of polyamines along with 
lactate or TNF-α or both on GnRH-I expression in GT1-7 cell line. TNF-α and 
lactate significantly decreased hypothalamic GnRH-I mRNA expression in GT1-7 
cells when treated for 24 h. Polyamines (putrescine and agmatine) in contrast, 
significantly increased GnRH-I mRNA expression in GT1-7 cells when treated for 
24 h. Also, polyamines increased GnRH-I mRNA expression when treated in presence 
of TNF-α or lactate thereby suggesting its neuro-protective role. This study 
also found 3809 differentially expressed genes through RNA-seq done between the 
hypothalamic GT1-7 cells treated with putrescine only versus TNF-α and 
putrescine. The present study suggests for the first time that putrescine 
treatment to TNFα-primed GT1-7 cells upregulates GnRH-I expression via 
regulation of several pathways such as calcium ion pathway, estrogen signaling, 
clock genes as well as regulating other metabolic process like neuronal 
differentiation and neurulation.

Inhalation of ambient PM2.5, shown to be able to cross the placenta, has been 
linked to adverse obstetric and postnatal metabolic health outcomes. The 
placenta regulates fetal growth and influences postnatal development via fetal 
programming. Placental gene expression may be influenced by intrauterine 
exposures to PM2.5. Herein, we explore whether maternal PM2.5 exposure during 
pregnancy alters placental gene expression related to lipid and glucose 
metabolism in a U.S. birth cohort, the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS). 
Average PM2.5 exposure level was estimated linking residential addresses and 
satellite data across the three trimesters using spatio-temporal models. Based 
on Gene Ontology annotations, we curated a list of 657 lipid and glucose 
metabolism genes. We conducted a two-staged analysis by leveraging placental 
RNA-Seq data from 148 subjects to identify top dysregulated metabolic genes 
associated with PM2.5 (Phase I) and then validated the results in placental 
samples from 415 participants of the cohort using RT-qPCR (Phase II). 
Associations between PM2.5 and placental gene expression were explored using 
multivariable linear regression models in the overall population and in 
sex-stratified analyses. The average level of PM2.5 exposure across pregnancy 
was 8.0μg/m3, which is below the national standard of 12μg/m3. Phase I revealed 
that expression levels of 32 out of the curated list of 657 genes were 
significantly associated with PM2.5 exposure (FDR P<0.01), 28 genes showed 
differential expression modified by sex of the infant. Five of these genes 
(ABHD3, ATP11A, CLTCL1, ST6GALNAC4 and PSCA) were validated using RT-qPCR. 
Associations were stronger in placentas from male births compared to females, 
indicating a sex-dependent effect. These genes are involved in inflammation, 
lipid transport, cell-cell communication or cell invasion. Our results suggest 
that gestational PM2.5 exposure may alter placental metabolic function. However, 
whether it confers long-term programming effects postnatally, especially in a 
sex-specific matter, warrants further studies.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) is a complex 
heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder for which mechanisms are poorly 
understood. To explore transcriptional changes underlying FTLD-TDP, we performed 
RNA-sequencing on 66 genetically unexplained FTLD-TDP patients, 24 FTLD-TDP 
patients with GRN mutations and 24 control participants. Using principal 
component analysis, hierarchical clustering, differential expression and 
coexpression network analyses, we showed that GRN mutation carriers and 
FTLD-TDP-A patients without a known mutation shared a common transcriptional 
signature that is independent of GRN loss-of-function. After combining both 
groups, differential expression as compared to the control group and 
coexpression analyses revealed alteration of processes related to immune 
response, synaptic transmission, RNA metabolism, angiogenesis and 
vesicle-mediated transport. Deconvolution of the data highlighted strong 
cellular alterations that were similar in FTLD-TDP-A and GRN mutation carriers 
with NSF as a potentially important player in both groups. We propose several 
potentially druggable pathways such as the GABAergic, GDNF and sphingolipid 
pathways. Our findings underline new disease mechanisms and strongly suggest 
that affected pathways in GRN mutation carriers extend beyond GRN and contribute 
to genetically unexplained forms of FTLD-TDP-A.

Sjögren's disease is a complex autoimmune disease with twelve established 
susceptibility loci. This genome-wide association study (GWAS) identifies ten 
novel genome-wide significant (GWS) regions in Sjögren's cases of European 
ancestry: CD247, NAB1, PTTG1-MIR146A, PRDM1-ATG5, TNFAIP3, XKR6, MAPT-CRHR1, 
RPTOR-CHMP6-BAIAP6, TYK2, SYNGR1. Polygenic risk scores yield predictability 
(AUROC = 0.71) and relative risk of 12.08. Interrogation of bioinformatics 
databases refine the associations, define local regulatory networks of GWS SNPs 
from the 95% credible set, and expand the implicated gene list to >40. Many GWS 
SNPs are eQTLs for genes within topologically associated domains in immune cells 
and/or eQTLs in the main target tissue, salivary glands.

Despite recent advances in therapy, multiple myeloma essentially remains an 
incurable malignancy. Targeting tumour-specific essential genes, which 
constitute a druggable dependency, potentially offers a strategy for developing 
new therapeutic agents to treat MM and overcome drug resistance. To explore this 
possibility, we analysed DepMap project data identifying 23 MM essential genes 
and examined the relationship between their expression and patient outcome in 
three independent series totalling 1503 cases. The expression of TCF3 and FLVCR1 
were both significantly associated with progression-free survival. IKBKB is 
already a drug target in other diseases, offering the prospect of repurposing to 
treat MM, while PIM2 is currently being investigated as a treatment for the 
disease. Our analysis supports the rationale of using large-scale genetic 
perturbation screens to guide the development of new therapeutic agents for MM.

The network approach is quickly becoming a fundamental building block of 
computational methods aiming at elucidating the mechanism of action (MoA) and 
therapeutic effect of drugs. By modeling the effect of drugs and diseases on 
different biological networks, it is possible to better explain the interplay 
between disease perturbations and drug targets as well as how drug compounds 
induce favorable biological responses and/or adverse effects. Omics technologies 
have been extensively used to generate the data needed to study the mechanisms 
of action of drugs and diseases. These data are often exploited to define 
condition-specific networks and to study whether drugs can reverse disease 
perturbations. In this review, we describe network data mining algorithms that 
are commonly used to study drug's MoA and to improve our understanding of the 
basis of chronic diseases. These methods can support fundamental stages of the 
drug development process, including the identification of putative drug targets, 
the in silico screening of drug compounds and drug combinations for the 
treatment of diseases. We also discuss recent studies using biological and 
omics-driven networks to search for possible repurposed FDA-approved drug 
treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19).

Recent genome-wide association studies uncovered part of blood pressure's 
heritability. However, there is still a vast gap between genetics and biology 
that needs to be bridged. Here, we followed up blood pressure genome-wide 
summary statistics of over 750,000 individuals, leveraging comprehensive 
epigenomic and transcriptomic data from blood with a follow-up in cardiovascular 
tissues to prioritise likely causal genes and underlying blood pressure 
mechanisms. We first prioritised genes based on coding consequences, multilayer 
molecular associations, blood pressure-associated expression levels, and 
coregulation evidence. Next, we followed up the prioritised genes in multilayer 
studies of genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, functional enrichment, 
and their potential suitability as drug targets. Our analyses yielded 1880 
likely causal genes for blood pressure, tens of which are targets of the 
available licensed drugs. We identified 34 novel genes for blood pressure, 
supported by more than one source of biological evidence. Twenty-eight (82%) of 
these new genes were successfully replicated by transcriptome-wide association 
analyses in a large independent cohort (n = ~220,000). We also found a 
substantial mediating role for epigenetic regulation of the prioritised genes. 
Our results provide new insights into genetic regulation of blood pressure in 
terms of likely causal genes and involved biological pathways offering 
opportunities for future translation into clinical practice.

Endometriosis is a condition characterized by implants of endometrial tissues 
into extrauterine sites, mostly within the pelvic peritoneum. The prevalence of 
endometriosis is under-diagnosed and is estimated to account for 5-10% of all 
women of reproductive age. The goal of this study was to develop a model for 
endometriosis based on the UK-biobank (UKB) and re-assess the contribution of 
known risk factors to endometriosis. We partitioned the data into those 
diagnosed with endometriosis (5924; ICD-10: N80) and a control group (142,723). 
We included over 1000 variables from the UKB covering personal information about 
female health, lifestyle, self-reported data, genetic variants, and medical 
history prior to endometriosis diagnosis. We applied machine learning algorithms 
to train an endometriosis prediction model. The optimal prediction was achieved 
with the gradient boosting algorithms of CatBoost for the data-combined model 
with an area under the ROC curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.81. The same results were 
obtained for women from a mixed ethnicity population of the UKB (7112; ICD-10: 
N80). We discovered that, prior to being diagnosed with endometriosis, affected 
women had significantly more ICD-10 diagnoses than the average unaffected woman. 
We used SHAP, an explainable AI tool, to estimate the marginal impact of a 
feature, given all other features. The informative features ranked by SHAP 
values included irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the length of the menstrual 
cycle. We conclude that the rich population-based retrospective data from the 
UKB are valuable for developing unified machine learning endometriosis models 
despite the limitations of missing data, noisy medical input, and participant 
age. The informative features of the model may improve clinical utility for 
endometriosis diagnosis.

Integrative prioritisation promotes translational use of disease genetic 
findings in target discovery. I report 'PiER' 
(http://www.genetictargets.com/PiER), web-based facilities that support ab 
initio and real-time genetic target prioritisation through integrative use of 
human disease genetics, functional genomics and protein interactions. By design, 
the PiER features two facilities: elementary and combinatory. The elementary 
facility is designed to perform specific tasks, including three online tools: 
eV2CG, utilising functional genomics to link disease-associated variants 
(particularly located at the non-coding genome) to core genes likely responsible 
for genetic associations in disease; eCG2PG, using knowledge of protein 
interactions to 'network' core genes and additional peripheral genes, producing 
a ranked list of core and peripheral genes; and eCrosstalk, exploiting the 
information of pathway-derived interactions to identify highly-ranked genes 
mediating crosstalk between molecular pathways. Each of elementary tasks giving 
results is sequentially piped to the next one. By chaining together elementary 
tasks, the combinatory facility automates genetics-led and network-based 
integrative prioritisation for genetic targets at the gene level (cTGene) and at 
the crosstalk level (cTCrosstalk). Together with a tutorial-like booklet 
describing instructions on how to use, the PiER facilities meet multi-tasking 
needs to accelerate computational translational medicine that leverages human 
disease genetics and genomics for early-stage target discovery and drug 
repurposing.

INTRODUCTION: The creation of ProteomeXchange data workflows in 2012 transformed 
the field of proteomics, consisting of the standardization of data submission 
and dissemination and enabling the widespread reanalysis of public MS proteomics 
data worldwide. ProteomeXchange has triggered a growing trend toward public 
dissemination of proteomics data, facilitating the assessment, reuse, 
comparative analyses, and extraction of new findings from public datasets. By 
2022, the consortium is integrated by PRIDE, PeptideAtlas, MassIVE, jPOST, 
iProX, and Panorama Public.
AREAS COVERED: Here, we review and discuss the current ecosystem of resources, 
guidelines, and file formats for proteomics data dissemination and reanalysis. 
Special attention is drawn to new exciting quantitative and post-translational 
modification-oriented resources. The challenges and future directions on data 
depositions including the lack of metadata and cloud-based and high-performance 
software solutions for fast and reproducible reanalysis of the available data 
are discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: The success of ProteomeXchange and the amount of proteomics data 
available in the public domain have triggered the creation and/or growth of 
other protein knowledgebase resources. Data reuse is a leading, active, and 
evolving field; supporting the creation of new formats, tools, and workflows to 
rediscover and reshape the public proteomics data.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk loci for 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, how they confer PTSD risk 
remains unclear. We aimed to identify genes that confer PTSD risk through their 
effects on brain protein abundance to provide new insights into PTSD 
pathogenesis. To that end, we integrated human brain proteomes with PTSD GWAS 
results to perform a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of PTSD, followed by 
Mendelian randomization, using a discovery and confirmatory study design. Brain 
proteomes (N = 525) were profiled from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using 
mass spectrometry. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) PTSD GWAS (n = 186,689) was 
used for the discovery PWAS, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium PTSD GWAS 
(n = 174,659) was used for the confirmatory PWAS. To understand whether genes 
identified at the protein-level were also evident at the transcript-level, we 
performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using human brain 
transcriptomes (N = 888) and the MVP PTSD GWAS results. We identified 11 genes 
that contribute to PTSD pathogenesis via their respective cis-regulated brain 
protein abundance. Seven of 11 genes (64%) replicated in the confirmatory PWAS 
and 4 of 11 also had their cis-regulated brain mRNA levels associated with PTSD. 
High confidence level was assigned to 9 of 11 genes after considering evidence 
from the confirmatory PWAS and TWAS. Most of the identified genes are expressed 
in other PTSD-relevant brain regions and several are preferentially expressed in 
excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. These genes 
are novel, promising targets for mechanistic and therapeutic studies to find new 
treatments for PTSD.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled the discovery of 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with 
many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, many of the 
identified variants lie in non-coding regions, limiting the identification of 
mechanisms that contribute to autoimmune disease progression. To address this 
problem, we developed a variant filtering workflow called 3DFAACTS-SNP to link 
genetic variants to target genes in a cell-specific manner. Here, we use 
3DFAACTS-SNP to identify candidate SNPs and target genes associated with the 
loss of immune tolerance in regulatory T cells (Treg) in T1D.
RESULTS: Using 3DFAACTS-SNP, we identified from a list of 1228 previously 
fine-mapped variants, 36 SNPs with plausible Treg-specific mechanisms of action. 
The integration of cell type-specific chromosome conformation capture data in 
3DFAACTS-SNP identified 266 regulatory regions and 47 candidate target genes 
that interact with these variant-containing regions in Treg cells. We further 
demonstrated the utility of the workflow by applying it to three other SNP 
autoimmune datasets, identifying 16 Treg-centric candidate variants and 60 
interacting genes. Finally, we demonstrate the broad utility of 3DFAACTS-SNP for 
functional annotation of all known common (> 10% allele frequency) variants from 
the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identified 9376 candidate variants 
and 4968 candidate target genes, generating a list of potential sites for future 
T1D or other autoimmune disease research.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that it is possible to further prioritise variants 
that contribute to T1D based on regulatory function, and illustrate the power of 
using cell type-specific multi-omics datasets to determine disease mechanisms. 
Our workflow can be customised to any cell type for which the individual 
datasets for functional annotation have been generated, giving broad 
applicability and utility.

Many primary-tumor subregions exhibit low levels of molecular oxygen and 
restricted access to nutrients due to poor vascularization in the tissue, 
phenomenon known as hypoxia. Hypoxic tumors are able to regulate the expression 
of certain genes and signaling molecules in the microenvironment that shift it 
towards a more aggressive phenotype. The transcriptional landscape of the tumor 
favors malignant transformation of neighboring cells and their migration to 
distant sites. Herein, we focused on identifying key proteins that participate 
in the signaling crossroads between hypoxic environment and metastasis 
progression that remain poorly defined. To shed light on these mechanisms, we 
performed an integrated multi-omics analysis encompassing genomic/transcriptomic 
alterations of hypoxia-related genes and Buffa hypoxia scores across 17 
pancarcinomas taken from the PanCancer Atlas project from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas consortium, protein-protein interactome network, shortest paths from 
hypoxia-related proteins to metastatic and angiogenic phenotypes, and drugs 
involved in current clinical trials to treat the metastatic disease. As results, 
we identified 30 hypoxia-related proteins highly involved in metastasis and 
angiogenesis. This set of proteins, validated with the MSK-MET Project, could 
represent key targets for developing therapies. The upregulation of mRNA was the 
most prevalent alteration in all cancer types. The highest frequencies of 
genomic/transcriptomic alterations and hypoxia score belonged to tumor stage 4 
and positive metastatic status in all pancarcinomas. The most significantly 
associated signaling pathways were HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, thyroid hormone, ErbB, FoxO, 
mTOR, insulin, MAPK, Ras, AMPK, and VEGF. The interactome network revealed 
high-confidence interactions among hypoxic and metastatic proteins. The analysis 
of shortest paths revealed several ways to spread metastasis and angiogenesis 
from hypoxic proteins. Lastly, we identified 23 drugs enrolled in clinical 
trials focused on metastatic disease treatment. Six of them were involved in 
advanced-stage clinical trials: aflibercept, bevacizumab, cetuximab, erlotinib, 
ipatasertib, and panitumumab.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the leading 
risk factor, after age, is possession of the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele 
(APOE4). Approximately 50% of AD patients carry one or two copies of APOE4 but 
the mechanisms by which it confers risk are still unknown. APOE4 carriers are 
reported to demonstrate changes in brain structure, cognition, and 
neuropathology, but findings have been inconsistent across studies. In the 
present study, we used multi-modal data to characterise the effects of APOE4 on 
the brain, to investigate whether AD pathology manifests differently in APOE4 
carriers, and to determine if AD pathomechanisms are different between carriers 
and non-carriers. Brain structural differences in APOE4 carriers were 
characterised by applying machine learning to over 2000 brain MRI measurements 
from 33,384 non-demented UK biobank study participants. APOE4 carriers showed 
brain changes consistent with vascular dysfunction, such as reduced white matter 
integrity in posterior brain regions. The relationship between APOE4 and AD 
pathology was explored among the 1260 individuals from the Religious Orders 
Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). APOE4 status had a greater effect 
on amyloid than tau load, particularly amyloid in the posterior cortical 
regions. APOE status was also highly correlated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy 
(CAA). Bulk tissue brain transcriptomic data from ROSMAP and a similar dataset 
from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank showed that differentially expressed genes 
between the dementia and non-dementia groups were enriched for vascular-related 
processes (e.g., "angiogenesis") in APOE4 carriers only. Immune-related 
transcripts were more strongly correlated with AD pathology in APOE4 carriers 
with some transcripts such as TREM2 and positively correlated with pathology 
severity in APOE4 carriers, but negatively in non-carriers. Overall, cumulative 
evidence from the largest neuroimaging, pathology, and transcriptomic studies 
available suggests that vascular dysfunction is key to the development of AD in 
APOE4 carriers. However, further studies are required to tease out 
non-APOE4-specific mechanisms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. The relative 
contribution of the numerous underlying functional mechanisms is poorly 
understood. To comprehensively understand the context and distribution of 
pathways that contribute to AD, we performed text-mining to generate an 
exhaustive, systematic assessment of the breadth and diversity of biological 
pathways within a corpus of 206,324 dementia publication abstracts. A total of 
91% (325/335) of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways have 
publications containing an association via at least 5 studies, while 63% of 
pathway terms have at least 50 studies providing a clear association with AD. 
Despite major technological advances, the same set of top-ranked pathways have 
been consistently related to AD for 30 years, including AD, immune system, 
metabolic pathways, cholinergic synapse, long-term depression, proteasome, 
diabetes, cancer, and chemokine signaling. AD pathways studied appear biased: 
animal model and human subject studies prioritize different AD pathways. 
Surprisingly, human genetic discoveries and drug targeting are not enriched in 
the most frequently studied pathways. Our findings suggest that not only is this 
disorder incredibly complex, but that its functional reach is also nearly 
global. As a consequence of our study, research results can now be assessed in 
the context of the wider AD literature, supporting the design of drug therapies 
that target a broader range of mechanisms. The results of this study can be 
explored at www.adpathways.org.

INTRODUCTION: Up to 30% of individuals with hemophilia A develop inhibitors to 
replacement factor VIII (FVIII), rendering the treatment ineffective. The 
underlying mechanism of inhibitor development remains poorly understood. The My 
Life, Our Future Research Repository (MLOF RR) has gathered F8 and F9 mutational 
information, phenotypic data, and biological material from over 11,000 
participants with hemophilia A (HA) and B as well as carriers enrolled across US 
hemophilia treatment centers, including over 5,000 whole-genome sequences. 
Identifying genes associated with inhibitors may contribute to our understanding 
of why certain patients develop those neutralizing antibodies.
AIM AND METHODS: Here, we performed a genome-wide association study and 
gene-based analyses to identify genes associated with inhibitors in participants 
with HA from the MLOF RR.
RESULTS: We identify a genome-wide significant association within the human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus in participants with HA with F8 intronic 
inversions. HLA typing revealed independent associations with the HLA alleles 
major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 1 (HLA DRB1*15:01) and major 
histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ beta 1 (DQB1*03:03). Variant 
aggregation tests further identified low-frequency variants within GRID2IP 
(glutamate receptor, ionotropic, delta 2 [GRID2] interacting protein 1) 
significantly associated with inhibitors.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our study confirms the association of DRB1*15:01 with FVIII 
inhibitors and identifies a novel association of DQB1*03:03 in individuals with 
HA carrying intronic inversions of F8. In addition, our results implicate 
GRID2IP, encoding GRID2-interacting protein, with the development of inhibitors, 
and suggest an unrecognized role of this gene in autoimmunity.

BACKGROUND: Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 
numerous risk genes for lacunar stroke, but it is challenging to decipher how 
they confer risk for the disease. We employed an integrative analytical pipeline 
to efficiently transform genetic associations to identify novel proteins for 
lacunar stroke.
METHODS: We systematically integrated lacunar stroke genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) (N=7338) with human brain proteomes (N=376) to perform 
proteome-wide association studies (PWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and 
Bayesian colocalization. We also used an independent human brain proteomic 
dataset (N=152) to annotate the new genes.
RESULTS: We found that the protein abundance of seven genes (ICA1L, CAND2, 
ALDH2, MADD, MRVI1, CSPG4, and PTPN11) in the brain was associated with lacunar 
stroke. These seven genes were mainly expressed on the surface of glutamatergic 
neurons, GABAergic neurons, and astrocytes. Three genes (ICA1L, CAND2, ALDH2) 
were causal in lacunar stroke (P < 0.05/proteins identified for PWAS; posterior 
probability of hypothesis 4 ≥ 75 % for Bayesian colocalization), and they were 
linked with lacunar stroke in confirmatory PWAS and independent MR. We also 
found that ICA1L is related to lacunar stroke at the brain transcriptome level.
CONCLUSIONS: Our present proteomic findings have identified ICA1L, CAND2, and 
ALDH2 as compelling genes that may give key hints for future functional research 
and possible therapeutic targets for lacunar stroke.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, 
which significantly impact the quality of life. Transcriptome-wide association 
study (TWAS) was conducted to estimate both transcriptomic and genomic features 
of AD and detected significant associations between 31 expression quantitative 
loci and 25 genes. Our results replicated well-known genetic markers for AD, as 
well as 4 novel associated genes. Next, transcriptome meta-analysis was 
conducted with 5 studies retrieved from public databases and identified 5 
additional novel susceptibility genes for AD. Applying the connectivity map to 
the results from TWAS and meta-analysis, robustly enriched perturbations were 
identified and their chemical or functional properties were analyzed. Here, we 
report the first research on integrative approaches for an AD, combining TWAS 
and transcriptome meta-analysis. Together, our findings could provide a 
comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of AD and suggest 
potential drug candidates as alternative treatment options.

BACKGROUND: The Open Targets (OT) Platform integrates a wide range of data 
sources on target-disease associations to facilitate identification of potential 
therapeutic drug targets to treat human diseases. However, due to the complexity 
that targets are usually functionally pleiotropic and efficacious for multiple 
indications, challenges in identifying novel target to indication associations 
remain. Specifically, persistent need exists for new methods for integration of 
novel target-disease association evidence and biological knowledge bases via 
advanced computational methods. These offer promise for increasing power for 
identification of the most promising target-disease pairs for therapeutic 
development. Here we introduce a novel approach by integrating additional 
target-disease features with machine learning models to further uncover 
druggable disease to target indications.
RESULTS: We derived novel target-disease associations as supplemental features 
to OT platform-based associations using three data sources: (1) target tissue 
specificity from GTEx expression profiles; (2) target semantic similarities 
based on gene ontology; and (3) functional interactions among targets by 
embedding them from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Machine learning 
models were applied to evaluate feature importance and performance benchmarks 
for predicting targets with known drug indications. The evaluation results show 
the newly integrated features demonstrate higher importance than current 
features in OT. In addition, these also show superior performance over 
association benchmarks and may support discovery of novel therapeutic 
indications for highly pursued targets.
CONCLUSION: Our newly generated features can be used to represent additional 
underlying biological relatedness among targets and diseases to further empower 
improved performance for predicting novel indications for drug targets through 
advanced machine learning models. The proposed methodology enables a powerful 
new approach for systematic evaluation of drug targets with novel indications.

The condition known as 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating 
autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease caused by a deficiency of the 
ubiquitous protein survival of motor neuron (SMN), which is encoded by the SMN1 
and SMN2 genes. It is one of the most common pediatric recessive genetic 
diseases, and it represents the most common cause of hereditary infant 
mortality. After decades of intensive basic and clinical research efforts, and 
improvements in the standard of care, successful therapeutic milestones have 
been developed, delaying the progression of 5q SMA and increasing patient 
survival. At the same time, promising data from early-stage clinical trials have 
indicated that additional therapeutic options are likely to emerge in the near 
future. Here, we provide updated information on the molecular underpinnings of 
SMA; we also provide an overview of the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape 
for SMA, including SMN-targeted therapies, SMN-independent therapies, and 
combinational therapies that are likely to be key for the development of 
treatments that are effective across a patient's lifespan.

Shen Qi Wan (SQW) prescription has been used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) for thousands of years, but its pharmacological mechanism is still 
unclear. The network pharmacology method was used to reveal the potential 
pharmacological mechanism of SQW in the treatment of T2DM in this study. Nine 
core targets were identified through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, which were AKT1, INSR, SLC2A1, 
EGFR, PPARG, PPARA, GCK, NOS3, and PTPN1. Besides, this study found that SQW 
treated the T2DM through insulin resistance (has04931), insulin signaling 
pathway (has04910), adipocytokine signaling pathway (has04920), AMPK signaling 
pathway (has04152) and FoxO signaling pathway (has04068) via ingredient-hub 
target-pathway network analysis. Finally, molecular docking was used to verify 
the drug-target interaction network in this research. This study provides a 
certain explanation for treating T2DM by SQW prescription, and provides a 
certain angle and method for researchers to study the mechanism of TCM in the 
treatment of complex diseases.

Varicose veins affect one-third of Western society, with a significant subset of 
patients developing venous ulceration, costing $14.9 billion annually in the 
USA. Current management consists of either compression stockings, or surgical 
ablation for more advanced disease. Most varicose veins patients report a 
positive family history, and heritability is ~17%. We describe the largest 
two-stage genome-wide association study of varicose veins in 401,656 individuals 
from UK Biobank, and replication in 408,969 individuals from 23andMe (total 
135,514 cases and 675,111 controls). Forty-nine signals at 46 susceptibility 
loci were discovered. We map 237 genes to these loci, several of which are 
biologically plausible and tractable to therapeutic targeting. Pathway analysis 
identified enrichment in extracellular matrix biology, inflammation, 
(lymph)angiogenesis, vascular smooth muscle cell migration, and apoptosis. Using 
a polygenic risk score (PRS) derived in an independent cohort, we demonstrate 
its predictive utility and correlation with varicose veins surgery.

Metabolite levels measured in the human population are endophenotypes for 
biological processes. We combined sequencing data for 3,924 (whole-exome 
sequencing, WES, discovery) and 2,805 (whole-genome sequencing, WGS, 
replication) donors from a prospective cohort of blood donors in England. We 
used multiple approaches to select and aggregate rare genetic variants (minor 
allele frequency [MAF] < 0.1%) in protein-coding regions and tested their 
associations with 995 metabolites measured in plasma by using 
ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We 
identified 40 novel associations implicating rare coding variants (27 genes and 
38 metabolites), of which 28 (15 genes and 28 metabolites) were replicated. We 
developed algorithms to prioritize putative driver variants at each locus and 
used mediation and Mendelian randomization analyses to test directionality at 
associations of metabolite and protein levels at the ACY1 locus. Overall, 66% of 
reported associations implicate gene targets of approved drugs or bioactive 
drug-like compounds, contributing to drug targets' validating efforts.

The characteristic lobulated nuclear morphology of granulocytes is partially 
determined by composition of nuclear envelope proteins. Abnormal nuclear 
morphology is primarily observed as an increased number of hypolobulated 
immature neutrophils, called band cells, during infection or in rare 
envelopathies like Pelger-Huët anomaly. To search for sequence variants 
affecting nuclear morphology of granulocytes, we performed a genome-wide 
association study using band neutrophil fraction from 88,101 Icelanders. We 
describe 13 sequence variants affecting band neutrophil fraction at nine loci. 
Five of the variants are at the Lamin B receptor (LBR) locus, encoding an inner 
nuclear membrane protein. Mutations in LBR are linked to Pelger-Huët anomaly. In 
addition, we identify cosegregation of a rare stop-gain sequence variant in LBR 
and Pelger Huët anomaly in an Icelandic eight generation pedigree, initially 
reported in 1963. Two of the other loci include genes which, like LBR, play a 
role in the nuclear membrane function and integrity. These GWAS results 
highlight the role proteins of the inner nuclear membrane have as important for 
neutrophil nuclear morphology.

We investigate the use of confidence scores to evaluate the accuracy of a given 
AlphaFold (AF2) protein model for drug discovery. Prediction of accuracy is 
improved by not considering confidence scores below 80 due to the effects of 
disorder. On a set of recent crystal structures, 95% are likely to have accurate 
folds. Conformational discordance in the training set has a much more 
significant effect on accuracy than sequence divergence. We propose criteria for 
models and residues that are possibly useful for virtual screening. Based on 
these criteria, AF2 provides models for half of understudied (dark) human

Target prioritization is essential for drug discovery and repositioning. 
Applying computational methods to analyze and process multi-omics data to find 
new drug targets is a practical approach for achieving this. Despite an 
increasing number of methods for generating datasets such as genomics, 
phenomics, and proteomics, attempts to integrate and mine such datasets remain 
limited in scope. Developing hybrid intelligence solutions that combine human 
intelligence in the scientific domain and disease biology with the ability to 
mine multiple databases simultaneously may help augment drug target discovery 
and identify novel drug-indication associations. We believe that integrating 
different data sources using a singular numerical scoring system in a hybrid 
intelligent framework could help to bridge these different omics layers and 
facilitate rapid drug target prioritization for studies in drug discovery, 
development or repositioning. Herein, we describe our prototype of the StarGazer 
pipeline which combines multi-source, multi-omics data with a novel target 
prioritization scoring system in an interactive Python-based Streamlit 
dashboard. StarGazer displays target prioritization scores for genes associated 
with 1844 phenotypic traits, and is available via 
https://github.com/AstraZeneca/StarGazer.

Despite progress in the development of standards for describing and exchanging 
scientific information, the lack of easy-to-use standards for mapping between 
different representations of the same or similar objects in different databases 
poses a major impediment to data integration and interoperability. Mappings 
often lack the metadata needed to be correctly interpreted and applied. For 
example, are two terms equivalent or merely related? Are they narrow or broad 
matches? Or are they associated in some other way? Such relationships between 
the mapped terms are often not documented, which leads to incorrect assumptions 
and makes them hard to use in scenarios that require a high degree of precision 
(such as diagnostics or risk prediction). Furthermore, the lack of descriptions 
of how mappings were done makes it hard to combine and reconcile mappings, 
particularly curated and automated ones. We have developed the Simple Standard 
for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) which addresses these problems by: (i) 
Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to describe metadata 
that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in mappings explicit. (ii) 
Defining an easy-to-use simple table-based format that can be integrated into 
existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or query ontologies, 
and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data principles. (iii) Implementing 
open and community-driven collaborative workflows that are designed to evolve 
the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping 
practices. (iv) Providing reference tools and software libraries for working 
with the standard. In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe 
several use cases in detail and survey some of the existing work on 
standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the goal of making mappings 
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). The SSSOM specification 
can be found at http://w3id.org/sssom/spec. Database URL:

Inflammatory responses of the intestinal epithelial barrier in patients with 
Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are associated 
with gut microbial alterations. At a community level, there is scarce 
mechanistic evidence on the effects of gut microbial alterations on host mucosal 
barrier responses. We used a computational microbe-host interaction prediction 
framework based on network diffusion and systems biology to integrate publicly 
available paired gut microbial and intestinal gene expression datasets. The 
ileal signaling network potentially modulated by the microbiota was enriched 
with immune-related pathways such as those associated with IL-4, IL-2, IL-13, 
NFkB, and toll-like receptors. We identified bacterial proteins eliciting 
post-translational modifications on host receptors, resulting in the 
de-repression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via critical hub proteins such as 
NFkB. The signaling networks were over-represented with CD associated genes and 
CD drug targets. Using datasets generated from our validation cohorts, we 
confirmed some of the results.

BACKGROUND: The molecular basis of airway remodelling in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) remains poorly understood. We identified gene 
expression signatures associated with chest computed tomography (CT) scan airway 
measures to understand molecular pathways associated with airway disease.
METHODS: In 2396 subjects in the COPDGene Study, we examined the relationship 
between quantitative CT airway phenotypes and blood transcriptomes to identify 
airway disease-specific genes and to define an airway wall thickness (AWT) gene 
set score. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify 
associations of the AWT score with clinical phenotypes, bronchial gene 
expression and genetic variants.
RESULTS: Type 1 interferon (IFN)-induced genes were consistently associated with 
AWT, square root wall area of a hypothetical airway with 10 mm internal 
perimeter (Pi10) and wall area percentage, with the strongest enrichment in AWT. 
A score derived from 18 genes whose expression was associated with AWT was 
associated with COPD-related phenotypes including reduced lung function (forced 
expiratory volume in 1 s percentage predicted β= -3.4; p<0.05) and increased 
exacerbations (incidence rate ratio 1.7; p<0.05). The AWT score was reproducibly 
associated with AWT in bronchial samples from 23 subjects (β=3.22; p<0.05). The 
blood AWT score was associated with genetic variant rs876039, an expression 
quantitative trait locus for IKZF1, a gene that regulates IFN signalling and is 
associated with inflammatory diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: A gene expression signature with IFN-stimulated genes from 
peripheral blood and bronchial brushings is associated with CT AWT, lung 
function and exacerbations. Shared genes and genetic associations suggest viral 
responses and/or autoimmune dysregulation as potential underlying mechanisms of 
airway disease in COPD.

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory oral disease that affects approximately 
42% of adults 30 years of age or older in the United States. In response to 
microbial dysbiosis within the periodontal pockets surrounding teeth, the host 
immune system generates an inflammatory environment in which soft tissue and 
alveolar bone destruction occur. The objective of this study was to identify 
diagnostic biomarkers and the mechanistic drivers of inflammation in 
periodontitis to identify drugs that may be repurposed to treat chronic 
inflammation. A meta-analysis comprised of two independent RNA-seq datasets was 
performed. RNA-seq analysis, signal pathway impact analysis, protein-protein 
interaction analysis, and drug target analysis were performed to identify the 
critical pathways and key players that initiate inflammation in periodontitis as 
well as to predict potential drug targets. Seventy-eight differentially 
expressed genes, 10 significantly impacted signaling pathways, and 10 hub 
proteins in periodontal gingival tissue were identified. The top 10 drugs that 
may be repurposed for treating periodontitis were then predicted from the gene 
expression and pathway data. The efficacy of these drugs in treating 
periodontitis has yet to be investigated. However, this analysis indicates that 
these drugs may serve as potential therapeutics to treat inflammation in 
gingival tissue affected by periodontitis.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe fibrotic lung disease 
characterized by irreversible scarring of the lung parenchyma leading to 
dyspnea, progressive decline in lung function, and respiratory failure. We 
analyzed lung transcriptomic data from independent IPF cohorts using weighted 
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify gene modules based on 
their preservation status in these cohorts. The consensus gene modules were 
characterized by leveraging existing clinical and molecular data such as lung 
function, biological processes, pathways, and lung cell types. From a total of 
32 consensus gene modules identified, two modules were found to be significantly 
correlated with the disease, lung function, and preserved in other IPF datasets. 
The upregulated gene module was enriched for extracellular matrix, collagen 
metabolic process, and BMP signaling while the downregulated module consisted of 
genes associated with tube morphogenesis, blood vessel development, and cell 
migration. Using a combination of connectivity-based and trait-based 
significance measures, we identified and prioritized 103 "hub" genes (including 
25 secretory candidate biomarkers) by their similarity to known IPF genetic 
markers. Our validation studies demonstrate the dysregulated expression of 
CRABP2, a retinol-binding protein, in multiple lung cells of IPF, and its 
correlation with the decline in lung function.

BACKGROUND: Identifying the causal genes at the risk loci and elucidating their 
roles in schizophrenia (SCZ) pathogenesis remain significant challenges. To 
explore risk variants associated with gene expression in the human brain and to 
identify genes whose expression change may contribute to the susceptibility of 
SCZ, here we report a comprehensive integrative study on SCZ.
METHODS: We systematically integrated the genetic associations from a 
large-scale SCZ GWAS (N = 56,418) and brain expression quantitative trait loci 
(eQTL) data (N = 175) using a Bayesian statistical framework (Sherlock) and 
Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR). We also measured brain 
structure of 86 first-episode antipsychotic-naive schizophrenia patients and 152 
healthy controls with the structural MRI.
RESULTS: Both Sherlock (P = 3. 38 × 10-6) and SMR (P = 1. 90 × 10-8) analyses 
showed that TYW5 mRNA expression was significantly associated with risk of SCZ. 
Brain-based studies also identified a significant association between TYW5 
protein abundance and SCZ. The single-nucleotide polymorphism rs203772 showed 
significant association with SCZ and the risk allele is associated with higher 
transcriptional level of TYW5 in the prefrontal cortex. We further found that 
TYW5 was significantly upregulated in the brain tissues of SCZ cases compared 
with controls. In addition, TYW5 expression was also significantly higher in 
neurons induced from pluripotent stem cells of schizophrenia cases compared with 
controls. Finally, combining analysis of genotyping and MRI data showed that 
rs203772 was significantly associated with gray matter volume of the right 
middle frontal gyrus and left precuneus.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that TYW5 is a risk gene for SCZ. Our results provide 
useful information toward a better understanding of the genetic mechanism of 
TYW5 in risk of SCZ.

Aim: Molecular alterations in drug targets may result in differential drug 
activity. Therefore, the authors aimed to characterize how molecular alterations 
in drug targets were assessed during drug development. Materials & methods: The 
authors analyzed nonclinical and clinical study reports submitted to the US FDA 
for novel drugs approved in 2020 to determine if in vitro studies, animal models 
or clinical studies assessed molecular alterations in the drug target. Results & 
conclusion: Assessment of the impact of molecular alterations in drug targets on 
drug activity varies considerably depending on the type of assessment and 
therapeutic area. Premarket assessment of drug target molecular alterations is 
common in the oncology setting, less frequent in the genetic disease setting and 
rare for other diseases.

Promising drug development efforts may frequently fail due to unintended adverse 
reactions. Several methods have been developed to analyze such data, aiming to 
improve pharmacovigilance and drug safety. In this work, we provide a brief 
review of key directions to quantitatively analyzing adverse events and explore 
the potential of augmenting these methods using additional molecular data 
descriptors. We argue that molecular expansion of adverse event data may provide 
a path to improving the insights gained through more traditional 
pharmacovigilance approaches. Examples include the ability to assess statistical 
relevance with respect to underlying biomolecular mechanisms, the ability to 
generate plausible causative hypotheses and/or confirmation where possible, the 
ability to computationally study potential clinical trial designs and/or 
results, as well as the further provision of advanced features incorporated in 
innovative methods, such as machine learning. In summary, molecular data 
expansion provides an elegant way to extend mechanistic modeling, systems 
pharmacology, and patient-centered approaches for the assessment of drug safety. 
We anticipate that such advances in real-world data informatics and outcome 
analytics will help to better inform public health, via the improved ability to 
prospectively understand and predict various types of drug-induced molecular 
perturbations and adverse events.

BACKGROUND: For the most part, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have only 
partially explained the heritability of complex diseases. One of their 
limitations is to assume independent contributions of individual variants to the 
phenotype. Many tools have therefore been developed to investigate the 
interactions between distant loci, or epistasis. Among them, the recently 
proposed EpiGWAS models the interactions between a target variant and the rest 
of the genome. However, applying this approach to studying interactions along 
all genes of a disease map is not straightforward. Here, we propose a pipeline 
to that effect, which we illustrate by investigating a multiple sclerosis GWAS 
dataset from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 through 19 disease 
maps from the MetaCore pathway database.
RESULTS: For each disease map, we build an epistatic network by connecting the 
genes that are deemed to interact. These networks tend to be connected, 
complementary to the disease maps and contain hubs. In addition, we report 4 
epistatic gene pairs involving missense variants, and 25 gene pairs with a 
deleterious epistatic effect mediated by eQTLs. Among these, we highlight the 
interaction of GLI-1 and SUFU, and of IP10 and NF-[Formula: see text]B, as they 
both match known biological interactions. The latter pair is particularly 
promising for therapeutic development, as both genes have known inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showcases the ability of EpiGWAS to uncover biologically 
interpretable epistatic interactions that are potentially actionable for the 
development of combination therapy.

Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease mediated by interferon (IFN-γ) in 
concert with cell adhesion molecules and chemokines. Thymoquinone (TQ), a 
flavonoid derived from Nigella sativa, is reported to have anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, and cardiovascular protective properties. We evaluated the effects 
of TQ on the key pathogenic stages of atherosclerosis, including cell viability, 
inflammatory gene expression, cell migration, and cholesterol efflux, on human 
THP-1 macrophages in-vitro. Moreover, in-silico analysis was performed to 
predict the molecular targets and signaling mechanisms. We demonstrated that TQ 
treatment had no effect on cell viability and decreased the expression of 
monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 
(ICAM-1) in response to IFN-γ. In addition, we have also demonstrated that the 
THP-1 cell migration was inhibited by TQ in the absence or presence of MCP-1. 
Thymoquinone had no effect on cholesterol efflux from monocytes. In-silico 
analysis also identified several putative targets for TQ that are associated 
with inflammatory diseases and associated signaling pathways. Collectively, 
these results suggest that TQ has anti-inflammatory effects and may be a 
potential nutraceutical candidate for the prevention and treatment of 
atherosclerosis.

Identifying cellular functions dysregulated by disease-associated variants could 
implicate novel pathways for drug targeting or modulation in cell therapies. 
However, follow-up studies can be challenging if disease-relevant cell types are 
difficult to sample. Variants associated with immune diseases point toward the 
role of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells). We mapped genetic regulation 
(quantitative trait loci [QTL]) of gene expression and chromatin activity in 
Treg cells, and we identified 133 colocalizing loci with immune disease 
variants. Colocalizations of immune disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
variants with expression QTLs (eQTLs) controlling the expression of CD28 and 
STAT5A, involved in Treg cell activation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling, 
support the contribution of Treg cells to the pathobiology of immune diseases. 
Finally, we identified seven known drug targets suitable for drug repurposing 
and suggested 63 targets with drug tractability evidence among the GWAS signals 
that colocalized with Treg cell QTLs. Our study is the first in-depth 
characterization of immune disease variant effects on Treg cell gene expression 
modulation and dysregulation of Treg cell function.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is one of the two categories of inflammatory bowel 
diseases that affect the gastrointestinal tract. The heritability estimate has 
been reported to be 0.75. Several genes linked to Crohn's disease risk have been 
identified using a plethora of strategies such as linkage-based studies, 
candidate gene association studies, and lately through genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, a compendium of all the genes 
that have been associated with CD is lacking.
METHODS: We conducted functional analyses of a gene set generated from a 
systematic review where genes potentially related to CD found in the literature 
were analyzed and classified depending on the genetic evidence reported and 
putative biological function. For this, we retrieved and analyzed 2496 abstracts 
comprising 1067 human genes plus 22 publications regarding 133 genes from GWAS 
Catalog. Then, each gene was curated and categorized according to the type of 
evidence associated with Crohn's disease.
RESULTS: We identified 126 genes associated with Crohn's disease risk by 
specific experiments. Additionally, 71 genes were recognized associated through 
GWAS alone, 18 to treatment response, 41 to disease complications, and 81 to 
related diseases. Bioinformatic analysis of the 126 genes supports their 
importance in Crohn's disease and highlights genes associated with specific 
aspects such as symptoms, drugs, and comorbidities. Importantly, most genes were 
not included in commercial genetic panels suggesting that Crohn's disease is 
genetically underdiagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a total of 126 genes from PubMed and 71 from GWAS 
that showed evidence of association to diagnosis, 18 to treatment response, and 
41 to disease complications in Crohn's disease. This prioritized gene catalog 
can be explored at http://victortrevino.bioinformatics.mx/CrohnDisease .

Throughout human evolutionary history, large-scale migrations have led to 
intermixing (i.e., admixture) between previously separated human groups. 
Although classical and recent work have shown that studying admixture can yield 
novel historical insights, the extent to which this process contributed to 
adaptation remains underexplored. Here, we introduce a novel statistical model, 
specific to admixed populations, that identifies loci under selection while 
determining whether the selection likely occurred post-admixture or prior to 
admixture in one of the ancestral source populations. Through extensive 
simulations, we show that this method is able to detect selection, even in 
recently formed admixed populations, and to accurately differentiate between 
selection occurring in the ancestral or admixed population. We apply this method 
to genome-wide SNP data of ∼4,000 individuals in five admixed Latin American 
cohorts from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Our approach replicates 
previous reports of selection in the human leukocyte antigen region that are 
consistent with selection post-admixture. We also report novel signals of 
selection in genomic regions spanning 47 genes, reinforcing many of these 
signals with an alternative, commonly used local-ancestry-inference approach. 
These signals include several genes involved in immunity, which may reflect 
responses to endemic pathogens of the Americas and to the challenge of 
infectious disease brought by European contact. In addition, some of the 
strongest signals inferred to be under selection in the Native American 
ancestral groups of modern Latin Americans overlap with genes implicated in 
energy metabolism phenotypes, plausibly reflecting adaptations to novel dietary 
sources available in the Americas.

Background: It is imperative to identify drugs that allow treating symptoms of 
severe COVID-19. Respiratory failure is the main cause of death in severe 
COVID-19 patients, and the host inflammatory response at the lungs remains 
poorly understood. Methods: Therefore, we retrieved data from post-mortem lungs 
from COVID-19 patients and performed in-depth in silico analyses of 
single-nucleus RNA sequencing data, inflammatory protein interactome network, 
and shortest pathways to physiological phenotypes to reveal potential 
therapeutic targets and drugs in advanced-stage COVID-19 clinical trials. 
Results: Herein, we analyzed transcriptomics data of 719 inflammatory response 
genes across 19 cell types (116,313 nuclei) from lung autopsies. The functional 
enrichment analysis of the 233 significantly expressed genes showed that the 
most relevant biological annotations were inflammatory response, innate immune 
response, cytokine production, interferon production, macrophage activation, 
blood coagulation, NLRP3 inflammasome complex, and the TLR, JAK-STAT, NF-κB, 
TNF, oncostatin M signaling pathways. Subsequently, we identified 34 essential 
inflammatory proteins with both high-confidence protein interactions and 
shortest pathways to inflammation, cell death, glycolysis, and angiogenesis. 
Conclusion: We propose three small molecules (baricitinib, eritoran, and 
montelukast) that can be considered for treating severe COVID-19 symptoms after 
being thoroughly evaluated in COVID-19 clinical trials.

The scientific knowledge about which genes are involved in which diseases grows 
rapidly, which makes it difficult to keep up with new publications and genetics 
datasets. The DISEASES database aims to provide a comprehensive overview by 
systematically integrating and assigning confidence scores to evidence for 
disease-gene associations from curated databases, genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) and automatic text mining of the biomedical literature. Here, we 
present a major update to this resource, which greatly increases the number of 
associations from all these sources. This is especially true for the text-mined 
associations, which have increased by at least 9-fold at all confidence cutoffs. 
We show that this dramatic increase is primarily due to adding full-text 
articles to the text corpus, secondarily due to improvements to both the disease 
and gene dictionaries used for named entity recognition, and only to a very 
small extent due to the growth in number of PubMed abstracts. DISEASES now also 
makes use of a new GWAS database, Target Illumination by GWAS Analytics, which 
considerably increased the number of GWAS-derived disease-gene associations. 
DISEASES itself is also integrated into several other databases and resources, 
including GeneCards/MalaCards, Pharos/Target Central Resource Database and the 
Cytoscape stringApp. All data in DISEASES are updated on a weekly basis and is 
available via a web interface at https://diseases.jensenlab.org, from where it 
can also be downloaded under open licenses. Database URL:

Gene expression can serve as a powerful predictor for disease progression and 
other phenotypes. Consequently, microarrays, which capture gene expression 
genome-wide, have been used widely over the past two decades to derive biomarker 
signatures for tasks such as cancer grading, prognosticating the formation of 
metastases, survival, and others. Each of these signatures was selected and 
optimized for a very specific phenotype, tissue type, and experimental set-up. 
While all of these differences may naturally contribute to very heterogeneous 
and different biomarker signatures, all cancers share characteristics regardless 
of particular cell types or tissue as summarized in the hallmarks of cancer. 
These commonalities could give rise to biomarker signatures, which perform well 
across different phenotypes, cell and tissue types. Here, we explore this 
possibility by employing a network-based approach for pan-cancer biomarker 
discovery. We implement a random surfer model, which integrates interaction, 
expression, and phenotypic information to rank genes by their suitability for 
outcome prediction. To evaluate our approach, we assembled 105 high-quality 
microarray datasets sampled from around 13,000 patients and covering 13 cancer 
types. We applied our approach (NetRank) to each dataset and aggregated 
individual signatures into one compact signature of 50 genes. This signature 
stands out for two reasons. First, in contrast to other signatures of the 105 
datasets, it is performant across nearly all cancer types and phenotypes. 
Second, It is interpretable, as the majority of genes are linked to the 
hallmarks of cancer in general and proliferation specifically. Many of the 
identified genes are cancer drivers with a known mutation burden linked to 
cancer. Overall, our work demonstrates the power of network-based approaches to 
compose robust, compact, and universal biomarker signatures for cancer outcome 
prediction.

BACKGROUND: Endometriosis, classically viewed as a localized disease, is 
increasingly recognized as a systemic disease with multi-organ effects. This 
disease is highlighted by systemic inflammation in affected organs and by high 
comorbidity with immune-mediated diseases.
RESULTS: We provide genomic evidence to support the recognition of endometriosis 
as an inflammatory systemic disease. This was achieved through our genomics-led 
target prioritization, called 'END', that leverages the value of multi-layered 
genomic datasets (including genome-wide associations in disease, regulatory 
genomics, and protein interactome). Our prioritization recovered existing 
proof-of-concept therapeutic targeting in endometriosis and outperformed 
competing prioritization approaches (Open Targets and Naïve prioritization). 
Target genes at the leading prioritization revealed molecular hallmarks (and 
possibly the cellular basis as well) that are consistent with systemic disease 
manifestations. Pathway crosstalk-based attack analysis identified the critical 
gene AKT1. In the context of this gene, we further identified genes that are 
already targeted by licensed medications in other diseases, such as ESR1. Such 
analysis was supported by current interests targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway 
in endometriosis and by the fact that therapeutic agents targeting ESR1 are now 
under active clinical trials in disease. The construction of cross-disease 
prioritization map enabled the identification of shared and distinct targets 
between endometriosis and immune-mediated diseases. Shared target genes 
identified opportunities for repurposing existing immunomodulators, particularly 
﻿disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (such as TNF, IL6 and IL6R blockades, 
and JAK inhibitors). Genes highly prioritized only in endometriosis revealed 
disease-specific therapeutic potentials of targeting neutrophil degranulation - 
the exocytosis that can facilitate metastasis-like spread to distant organs 
causing inflammatory-like microenvironments.
CONCLUSION: Improved target prioritization, along with an atlas of in silico 
predicted targets and repurposed drugs (available at 
https://23verse.github.io/end), provides genomic insights into endometriosis, 
reveals disease-specific therapeutic potentials, and expands the existing 
theories on the origin of disease.

Previous studies have shown that Poria cocos-based formulas combined with 
chemotherapy can improve the quality of life of ovarian cancer patients. 
However, the results are still controversial. We systematically searched the 
literature from eight databases to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Poria 
cocos-based formulas in combination with paclitaxel-carboplatin in treating 
ovarian cancer (OC). Subsequently, network pharmacology, molecular docking and 
cell experiments were performed to further verify the underlying molecular 
mechanism. Thirteen randomized controlled trials, including 922 patients with 
OC, were enrolled in the study. The results indicated that Poria cocos-based 
compounds combined with paclitaxel-carboplatin significantly improved patients' 
tumor response rate, traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score, Karnofsky 
Performance Scale, physical and social function, and reduced side effects of 
chemotherapy compared to the paclitaxel-carboplatin alone. According to the 
network pharmacological analysis, tumulosic acid were the most bioactive 
compounds of Poria cocos. BCL2L1 is highly expressed in OC and is associated 
with a worse prognosis which could become potential drug target. Functional 
enrichment analysis suggested that the anti-OC effect of Poria cocos may be 
related to PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The molecular docking results indicated 
that tumulosic acid might inhibit OC by regulating BCL2L1. Vitro experiment 
confirmed tumulosic acid that induced cell apoptosis by modulating PI3K/AKT 
signaling and BCL2L1. Our study may provide a clinical basis and theoretical 
rationale for combining Poria cocos-based formulas with chemotherapy for OC. In 
addition, the integrated pharmacological strategy proposed in our study provides 
an excellent example for exploring the mechanism of complex formulas.

Indication expansion aims to find new indications for existing targets in order 
to accelerate the process of launching a new drug for a disease on the market. 
The rapid increase in data types and data sources for computational drug 
discovery has fostered the use of semantic knowledge graphs (KGs) for indication 
expansion through target centric approaches, or in other words, target 
repositioning. Previously, we developed a novel method to construct a KG for 
indication expansion studies, with the aim of finding and justifying alternative 
indications for a target gene of interest. In contrast to other KGs, ours 
combines human-curated full-text literature and gene expression data from 
biomedical databases to encode relationships between genes, diseases, and 
tissues. Here, we assessed the suitability of our KG for explainable 
target-disease link prediction using a glass-box approach. To evaluate the 
predictive power of our KG, we applied shortest path with tissue information- 
and embedding-based prediction methods to a graph constructed with information 
published before or during 2010. We also obtained random baselines by applying 
the shortest path predictive methods to KGs with randomly shuffled node labels. 
Then, we evaluated the accuracy of the top predictions using gene-disease links 
reported after 2010. In addition, we investigated the contribution of the KG's 
tissue expression entity to the prediction performance. Our experiments showed 
that shortest path-based methods significantly outperform the random baselines 
and embedding-based methods outperform the shortest path predictions. 
Importantly, removing the tissue expression entity from the KG severely impacts 
the quality of the predictions, especially those produced by the embedding 
approaches. Finally, since the interpretability of the predictions is crucial in 
indication expansion, we highlight the advantages of our glass-box model through 
the examination of example candidate target-disease predictions.

University, Guangzhou, China.

BACKGROUND: RAD51, a critical protein for DNA repairment, has been found to 
associate with multiple cancer types, but, so far, a systematic pan-cancer 
analysis of RAD51 has not been done yet.
METHODS: Data were obtained from multiple open databases and genetic alteration, 
gene expression, survival association, functional enrichment, stemness, mutation 
association, immunity association, and drug therapy association of RAD51were 
analyzed. A prognostic model of RAD51 for overall glioma was constructed as an 
example application of RAD51 as a biomarker.
RESULTS: RAD51 was overexpressed in 28 types of cancers and was associated with 
worse overall survival in 11 cancer types. RAD51 correlated genes were enriched 
in cell cycle terms. RAD51 was associated with cancer stemness, tumor mutational 
burden, and multiple immunomodulators in different cancer types. RAD51 
expression was different across immune subtypes in 11 cancer types. RAD51 was 
closely associated with cancer immune microenvironments in some cancer types. 
Proliferating T cells was the cell type that expressed highest RAD51 across most 
of the cancer samples analyzed. RAD51 expression had an AUC of over 0.5 in 12 of 
the 23 ICB subcohorts. The Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion of 9 cancer 
types were different between RAD51 high and low groups. RAD51 expression showed 
negative correlations with the sensitivity of most drugs. A prognostic nomogram 
was constructed with a high confidence.
CONCLUSION: RAD51 is a clinical valuable biomarker for multiple cancer types, 
regarding its potential power for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic 
prediction.

BACKGROUND: THO complex members (THOCs) are essential for mRNA processing, 
transcription elongation, mRNA export and genome integrity, which may be 
associated with tumor. However, the significance of THO complex members in 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been clarified.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated expression levels, clinicopathological 
correlation, diagnostic and prognostic value, disease associations, 
co-expression network, functional enrichment, genetic variation, drug 
sensitivity, molecular targets, and immune infiltration of THOCs in HCC using 
UALCAN, ICGC, HPA, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, The Open Targets Platform database, 
GeneMANIA, WebGestalt, GSCALite, LinkedOmics, TIMER. Meanwhile, the mRNA 
expression levels of THOCs in HCC were verified by qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: THOCs were significantly up-regulated at the transcription level in 
HCC, and overexpression of THOCs was correlated with clinicopathological 
features. THOCs had potential diagnostic and prognostic value for HCC. THOCs 
could participate in apoptosis, regulate cell cycle, and were also involved in 
DNA damage response. Important cancer-related signaling pathways such as EMT, 
RAS/MAPK pathway and RKT pathway were also related to THOCs expression. In 
addition, the expression level of THOC1/2/6/7 was negatively correlated with 
drug resistance. And miRNA, kinase, and transcription factor targets associated 
with THOCs have been identified. Meanwhile, THOCs were associated with immune 
infiltration in HCC.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that THO complex members have important clinical 
significance for HCC and have potential clinical utility in diagnosis, treatment 
and prognosis.

The cardiac conduction system (CCS) comprises critical components responsible 
for the initiation, propagation, and coordination of the action potential. 
Aberrant CCS development can cause conduction abnormalities, including sick 
sinus syndrome, accessory pathways, and atrioventricular and bundle branch 
blocks. Gene Ontology (GO; http://geneontology.org/) is an invaluable global 
bioinformatics resource which provides structured, computable knowledge 
describing the functions of gene products. Many gene products are known to be 
involved in CCS development; however, this information is not comprehensively 
captured by GO. To address the needs of the heart development research 
community, this study aimed to describe the specific roles of proteins reported 
in the literature to be involved with CCS development and/or function. 14 
proteins were prioritized for GO annotation which led to the curation of 15 
peer-reviewed primary experimental articles using carefully selected GO terms. 
152 descriptive GO annotations, including those describing sinoatrial node and 
atrioventricular node development were created and submitted to the GO 
Consortium database. A functional enrichment analysis of 35 key CCS development 
proteins confirmed that this work has improved the in-silico interpretation of 
this CCS dataset. This work may improve future investigations of the CCS with 
application of high-throughput methods such as genome-wide association studies 
analysis, proteomics, and transcriptomics.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a systemic disease that may cause 
severe metabolic complications in multiple tissues including liver, kidney, and 
cardiovascular system. However, the underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment 
remain elusive. Our study shows that impairment of ACE2 pathway is a key factor 
linking virus infection to its secondary metabolic sequelae. By using 
structure-based high-throughput virtual screening and connectivity map database, 
followed with experimental validations, we identify imatinib, methazolamide, and 
harpagoside as direct enzymatic activators of ACE2. Imatinib and methazolamide 
remarkably improve metabolic perturbations in vivo in an ACE2-dependent manner 
under the insulin-resistant state and SARS-CoV-2-infected state. Moreover, viral 
entry is directly inhibited by these three compounds due to allosteric 
inhibition of ACE2 binding to spike protein on SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, our 
study shows that enzymatic activation of ACE2 via imatinib, methazolamide, or 
harpagoside may be a conceptually new strategy to treat metabolic sequelae of 
COVID-19.

Network-based approaches are becoming increasingly popular for drug discovery as 
they provide a systems-level overview of the mechanisms underlying disease 
pathophysiology. They have demonstrated significant early promise over other 
methods of biological data representation, such as in target discovery, side 
effect prediction and drug repurposing. In parallel, an explosion of -omics data 
for the deep characterization of biological systems routinely uncovers molecular 
signatures of disease for similar applications. Here, we present RPath, a novel 
algorithm that prioritizes drugs for a given disease by reasoning over causal 
paths in a knowledge graph (KG), guided by both drug-perturbed as well as 
disease-specific transcriptomic signatures. First, our approach identifies the 
causal paths that connect a drug to a particular disease. Next, it reasons over 
these paths to identify those that correlate with the transcriptional signatures 
observed in a drug-perturbation experiment, and anti-correlate to signatures 
observed in the disease of interest. The paths which match this signature 
profile are then proposed to represent the mechanism of action of the drug. We 
demonstrate how RPath consistently prioritizes clinically investigated 
drug-disease pairs on multiple datasets and KGs, achieving better performance 
over other similar methodologies. Furthermore, we present two case studies 
showing how one can deconvolute the predictions made by RPath as well as predict 
novel targets.

By combining 6 druggable genome resources, we identify 6,083 genes as potential 
druggable genes (PDGs). We characterize their expression, recurrent genomic 
alterations, cancer dependencies, and therapeutic potentials by integrating 
genome, functionome, and druggome profiles across cancers. 81.5% of PDGs are 
reliably expressed in major adult cancers, 46.9% show selective expression 
patterns, and 39.1% exhibit at least one recurrent genomic alteration. We 
annotate a total of 784 PDGs as dependent genes for cancer cell growth. We 
further quantify 16 cancer-related features and estimate a PDG cancer drug 
target score (PCDT score). PDGs with higher PCDT scores are significantly 
enriched for genes encoding kinases and histone modification enzymes. 
Importantly, we find that a considerable portion of high PCDT score PDGs are 
understudied genes, providing unexplored opportunities for drug development in 
oncology. By integrating the druggable genome and the cancer genome, our study 
thus generates a comprehensive blueprint of potential druggable genes across 
cancers.

The early diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and personalized therapy of lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a challenging issue. KCNQ1 (potassium 
voltage-gated channel subfamily Q Member 1) is implicated in long QT syndrome 
(LQTS) and cardiac arrhythmia, while its significance in LUAD remains unclear. 
In this study, we aimed to explore the significance of KCNQ1 in terms of 
clinical value, tumor immunity, underlying mechanisms, and a precision medicine 
approach by means of multi-omics analysis. The association of KCNQ1 with LUAD 
was first explored. Both altered variants and high expression of KCNQ1 in a 
TCGA-LUAD cohort indicated a favorable outcome. KCNQ1 levels had a negative 
correlation with tumor proliferation index Ki67 levels. siRNA-knockdown of KCNQ1 
promoted the migration ability of lung cancer cells. KCNQ1 levels were decreased 
in LUAD tissue compared to normal tissue. A receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve indicated good diagnostic efficiency of KCNQ1. High KCNQ1 is 
associated with an immunoactive profile of immune infiltration and 
immunomodulators and is involved in the inhibition of the cell cycle and DNA 
replication. Lapatinib was identified as a potent drug for LUAD in the context 
of low KCNQ1. This study unveiled the significance of KCNQ1 in diagnosis and 
prognosis and provided a corresponding precision medicine strategy for LUAD.

Interferon-β (IFN-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine secreted in response to various 
pathological conditions and is clinically used for therapy of multiple 
sclerosis. Its application for treatment of cancer, infections and pulmonary 
diseases is limited by incomplete understanding of regulatory mechanisms of its 
functioning. Recently, we reported that IFN-β activity is affected by 
interactions with S100A1, S100A4, S100A6, and S100P proteins, which are members 
of the S100 protein family of multifunctional Ca2+-binding proteins possessing 
cytokine-like activities (Int J Mol Sci. 2020;21(24):9473). Here we show that 
IFN-β interacts with one more representative of the S100 protein family, the 
S100B protein, involved in numerous oncological and neurological diseases. The 
use of chemical crosslinking, intrinsic fluorescence, and surface plasmon 
resonance spectroscopy revealed IFN-β binding to Ca2+-loaded dimeric and 
monomeric forms of the S100B protein. Calcium depletion blocks the S100B-IFN-β 
interaction. S100B monomerization increases its affinity to IFN-β by 2.7 orders 
of magnitude (equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex reaches 47 pM). 
Crystal violet assay demonstrated that combined application of IFN-β and S100B 
(5-25 nM) eliminates their inhibitory effects on MCF-7 cell viability. 
Bioinformatics analysis showed that the direct modulation of IFN-β activity by 
the S100B protein described here could be relevant to progression of multiple 
oncological and neurological diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a 
progressive loss of memory and a general cognitive decline leading to dementia. 
AD is characterized by changes in the behavior of the genome and can be traced 
across multiple brain regions and cell types. It is mainly associated with 
β-amyloid deposits and tau protein misfolding, leading to neurofibrillary 
tangles. In recent years, however, research has shown that there is a high 
complexity of mechanisms involved in AD neurophysiology and functional decline 
enabling its diverse presentation and allowing more questions to arise. In this 
study, we present a computational approach to facilitate brain region-specific 
analysis of genes and biological processes involved in the memory process in AD. 
Utilizing current genetic knowledge we provide a gene set of 265 
memory-associated genes in AD, combinations of which can be found co-expressed 
in 11 different brain regions along with their functional role. The identified 
genes participate in a spectrum of biological processes ranging from structural 
and neuronal communication to epigenetic alterations and immune system 
responses. These findings provide new insights into the molecular background of 
AD and can be used to bridge the genotype-phenotype gap and allow for new 
therapeutic hypotheses.

The human kinome plays a crucial role in several pathways. Its dysregulation has 
been linked to diverse central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders with a 
drastic impact on the aging population. Among them, tauopathies, such as 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Lobar degeneration (FTLD-tau), are 
neurodegenerative disorders pathologically defined by the presence of 
hyperphosphorylated tau-positive intracellular inclusions known as 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Compelling evidence has reported the great 
potential of the simultaneous modulation of multiple protein kinases (PKs) 
involved in abnormal tau phosphorylation through a concerted pharmacological 
approach to achieve a superior therapeutic effect relative to classic "one 
target, one drug" approaches. Here, we report on the identification and 
characterization of ARN25068 (4), a low nanomolar and well-balanced dual GSK-3β 
and FYN inhibitor, which also shows inhibitory activity against DYRK1A, an 
emerging target in AD and tauopathies. Computational and X-Ray studies highlight 
compound 4's typical H-bonding pattern of ATP-competitive inhibitors at the 
binding sites of all three PKs. In a tau phosphorylation assay on 
Tau0N4R-TM-tGFP U2OS cell line, 4 reduces the extent of tau phosphorylation, 
promoting tau-stabilized microtubule bundles. In conclusion, this compound 
emerges as a promising prototype for further SAR explorations to develop potent 
and well-balanced triple GSK-3β/FYN/DYRK1A inhibitors to tackle tau 
hyperphosphorylation.

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have elucidated the genetic components of 
Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, because the vast majority of GWAS association 
signals fall within non-coding regions, translating these results into an 
interpretable, mechanistic understanding of the disease etiology remains a major 
challenge in the field. In this review, we provide an overview of the approaches 
to prioritize putative causal variants and genes as well as summarise the 
primary findings of previous studies. We then discuss recent efforts to 
integrate multi-omics data to identify likely pathogenic cell types and 
biological pathways implicated in PD pathogenesis. We have compiled full summary 
statistics of cell-type, tissue, and phentoype enrichment analyses from multiple 
studies of PD GWAS and provided them in a standardized format as a resource for 
the research community (https://github.com/RajLabMSSM/PD_omics_review). Finally, 
we discuss the experimental, computational, and conceptual advances that will be 
necessary to fully elucidate the effects of functional variants and genes on 
cellular dysregulation and disease risk.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a multifactorial global disease, recognized as one 
of the leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Timely and 
correct diagnoses and effective treatments could significantly reduce incidence 
of complications and improve patient prognoses. In this study, seven 
unconventional differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (MAN2A2, TNFRSF12A, SPP1, 
CSNK1D, PLAUR, PFKFB3, and CXCL16, collectively termed the MTSCPPC signature) 
were identified through integrating DEGs from six MI microarray datasets. The 
pathological and theranostic roles of the MTSCPPC signature in MI were 
subsequently analyzed. We evaluated interactions of the MTSCPPC signature with 
ovatodiolide, a bioactive compound isolated from Anisomeles indica (L.) Kuntze, 
using in silico molecular docking tools and compared it to specific inhibitors 
of the members of the MTSCPPC signature. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 
the public databases revealed high expression levels of the MTSCPPC signature in 
immune cells of adult human hearts during an MI event. The MTSCPPC signature was 
significantly associated with the cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, 
chemokine signaling, immune and inflammatory responses, and metabolic 
dysregulation in MI. Analysis of a micro (mi)RNA regulatory network of the 
MTSCPPC signature suggested post-transcriptional activation and the roles of 
miRNAs in the pathology of MI. Our molecular docking analysis suggested a higher 
potential for ovatodiolide to target MAN2A2, CSNK1D, and TNFRSF12A. 
Collectively, the results derived from the present study further advance our 
understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms of MI and provide a potential 
MI theranostic signature with ovatodiolide as a therapeutic candidate.

Haematological traits are linked to cardiovascular, metabolic, infectious and 
immune disorders, as well as cancer. Here, we examine the role of genetic 
variation in shaping haematological traits in two isolated Mediterranean 
populations. Using whole-genome sequencing data at 22× depth for 1457 
individuals from Crete (MANOLIS) and 1617 from the Pomak villages in Greece, we 
carry out a genome-wide association scan for haematological traits using linear 
mixed models. We discover novel associations (p < 5 × 10-9) of five rare 
non-coding variants with alleles conferring effects of 1.44-2.63 units of 
standard deviation on red and white blood cell count, platelet and red cell 
distribution width. Moreover, 10.0% of individuals in the Pomak population and 
6.8% in MANOLIS carry a pathogenic mutation in the Haemoglobin Subunit Beta 
(HBB) gene. The mutational spectrum is highly diverse (10 different mutations). 
The most frequent mutation in MANOLIS is the common Mediterranean variant 
IVS-I-110 (G>A) (rs35004220). In the Pomak population, c.364C>A ("HbO-Arab", 
rs33946267) is most frequent (4.4% allele frequency). We demonstrate effects on 
haematological and other traits, including bilirubin, cholesterol, and, in 
MANOLIS, height and gestation age. We find less severe effects on red blood cell 
traits for HbS, HbO, and IVS-I-6 (T>C) compared to other b+ mutations. Overall, 
we uncover allelic diversity of HBB in Greek isolated populations and find an 
important role for additional rare variants outside of HBB.

Identification of the correct targets is a key element for successful drug 
development. However, there are limited approaches for predicting drug targets 
for specific diseases using omics data, and few have leveraged expression 
profiles from gene perturbations. We present a novel computational approach for 
drug target discovery based on machine learning (ML) models. ML models are first 
trained on drug-induced expression profiles with outcomes defined as whether the 
drug treats the studied disease. The goal is to "learn" the expression patterns 
associated with treatment. Then, the fitted ML models were applied to expression 
profiles from gene perturbations (overexpression (OE)/knockdown (KD)). We 
prioritized targets based on predicted probabilities from the ML model, which 
reflects treatment potential. The methodology was applied to predict targets for 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 
schizophrenia (SCZ). We validated our approach by evaluating whether the 
identified targets may 're-discover' known drug targets from an external 
database (OpenTargets). Indeed, we found evidence of significant enrichment 
across all diseases under study. A further literature search revealed that many 
candidates were supported by previous studies. For example, we predicted PSMB8 
inhibition to be associated with the treatment of RA, which was supported by a 
study showing that PSMB8 inhibitors (PR-957) ameliorated experimental RA in 
mice. In conclusion, we propose a new ML approach to integrate the expression 
profiles from drugs and gene perturbations and validated the framework. Our 
approach is flexible and may provide an independent source of information when 
prioritizing drug targets.

The pharmacological arsenal against the COVID-19 pandemic is largely based on 
generic anti-inflammatory strategies or poorly scalable solutions. Moreover, as 
the ongoing vaccination campaign is rolling slower than wished, affordable and 
effective therapeutics are needed. To this end, there is increasing attention 
toward computational methods for drug repositioning and de novo drug design. 
Here, multiple data-driven computational approaches are systematically 
integrated to perform a virtual screening and prioritize candidate drugs for the 
treatment of COVID-19. From the list of prioritized drugs, a subset of 
representative candidates to test in human cells is selected. Two compounds, 
7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib, show synergistic antiviral effects in 
vitro and strongly inhibit viral-induced syncytia formation. Moreover, since 
existing drug repositioning methods provide limited usable information for de 
novo drug design, the relevant chemical substructures of the identified drugs 
are extracted to provide a chemical vocabulary that may help to design new 
effective drugs.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a strong genetic predisposition. However, its risk 
genes remain incompletely identified. We developed an Alzheimer's brain gene 
network-based approach to predict AD-associated genes by leveraging the 
functional pattern of known AD-associated genes. Our constructed network 
outperformed existing networks in predicting AD genes. We then systematically 
validated the predictions using independent genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic 
data, neuropathological and clinical data. First, top-ranked genes were enriched 
in AD-associated pathways. Second, using external gene expression data from the 
Mount Sinai Brain Bank study, we found that the top-ranked genes were 
significantly associated with neuropathological and clinical traits, including 
the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score, Braak 
stage score and clinical dementia rating. The analysis of Alzheimer's brain 
single-cell RNA-seq data revealed cell-type-specific association of predicted 
genes with early pathology of AD. Third, by interrogating proteomic data in the 
Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project and Baltimore Longitudinal 
Study of Aging studies, we observed a significant association of protein 
expression level with cognitive function and AD clinical severity. The network, 
method and predictions could become a valuable resource to advance the 
identification of risk genes for AD.

Several factors, including advances in computational algorithms, the 
availability of high-performance computing hardware, and the assembly of large 
community-based databases, have led to the extensive application of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) in the biomedical domain for nearly 20 years. AI algorithms 
have attained expert-level performance in cancer research. However, only a few 
AI-based applications have been approved for use in the real world. Whether AI 
will eventually be capable of replacing medical experts has been a hot topic. In 
this article, we first summarize the cancer research status using AI in the past 
two decades, including the consensus on the procedure of AI based on an ideal 
paradigm and current efforts of the expertise and domain knowledge. Next, the 
available data of AI process in the biomedical domain are surveyed. Then, we 
review the methods and applications of AI in cancer clinical research 
categorized by the data types including radiographic imaging, cancer genome, 
medical records, drug information and biomedical literatures. At last, we 
discuss challenges in moving AI from theoretical research to real-world cancer 
research applications and the perspectives toward the future realization of AI 
participating cancer treatment.

Genome-wide association studies rely on the statistical inference of untyped 
variants, called imputation, to increase the coverage of genotyping arrays. 
However, the results are often suboptimal in populations underrepresented in 
existing reference panels and array designs, since the selected single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may fail to capture population-specific 
haplotype structures, hence the full extent of common genetic variation. Here, 
we propose to sequence the full genomes of a small subset of an underrepresented 
study cohort to inform the selection of population-specific add-on tag SNPs and 
to generate an internal population-specific imputation reference panel, such 
that the remaining array-genotyped cohort could be more accurately imputed. 
Using a Tanzania-based cohort as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the validity 
of our approach by showing improvements in imputation accuracy after the 
addition of our designed add-on tags to the base H3Africa array.

Erythropoietin (EPO) is a clinically significant four-helical cytokine, 
exhibiting erythropoietic, cytoprotective, immunomodulatory, and 
cancer-promoting activities. Despite vast knowledge on its signaling pathways 
and physiological effects, extracellular factors regulating EPO activity remain 
underexplored. Here we show by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, that 
among eighteen members of Ca2+-binding proteins of the S100 protein family 
studied, only S100A2, S100A6 and S100P proteins specifically recognize EPO with 
equilibrium dissociation constants ranging from 81 nM to 0.5 µM. The 
interactions occur exclusively under calcium excess. Bioinformatics analysis 
showed that the EPO-S100 interactions could be relevant to progression of 
neoplastic diseases, including cancer, and other diseases. The detailed 
knowledge of distinct physiological effects of the EPO-S100 interactions could 
favor development of more efficient clinical implications of EPO. Summing up our 
data with previous findings, we conclude that S100 proteins are potentially able 
to directly affect functional activities of specific members of all families of 
four-helical cytokines, and cytokines of other structural superfamilies.

BACKGROUND: LINCS, "Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures", 
and IDG, "Illuminating the Druggable Genome", are both NIH projects and 
consortia that have generated rich datasets for the study of the molecular basis 
of human health and disease. LINCS L1000 expression signatures provide unbiased 
systems/omics experimental evidence. IDG provides compiled and curated knowledge 
for illumination and prioritization of novel drug target hypotheses. Together, 
these resources can support a powerful new approach to identifying novel drug 
targets for complex diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which continues 
to inflict severe harm on human health, and resist traditional research 
approaches.
RESULTS: Integrating LINCS and IDG, we built the Knowledge Graph Analytics 
Platform (KGAP) to support an important use case: identification and 
prioritization of drug target hypotheses for associated diseases. The KGAP 
approach includes strong semantics interpretable by domain scientists and a 
robust, high performance implementation of a graph database and related 
analytical methods. Illustrating the value of our approach, we investigated 
results from queries relevant to PD. Approved PD drug indications from IDG's 
resource DrugCentral were used as starting points for evidence paths exploring 
chemogenomic space via LINCS expression signatures for associated genes, 
evaluated as target hypotheses by integration with IDG. The KG-analytic scoring 
function was validated against a gold standard dataset of genes associated with 
PD as elucidated, published mechanism-of-action drug targets, also from 
DrugCentral. IDG's resource TIN-X was used to rank and filter KGAP results for 
novel PD targets, and one, SYNGR3 (Synaptogyrin-3), was manually investigated 
further as a case study and plausible new drug target for PD.
CONCLUSIONS: The synergy of LINCS and IDG, via KG methods, empowers graph 
analytics methods for the investigation of the molecular basis of complex 
diseases, and specifically for identification and prioritization of novel drug 
targets. The KGAP approach enables downstream applications via integration with 
resources similarly aligned with modern KG methodology. The generality of the 
approach indicates that KGAP is applicable to many disease areas, in addition to 
PD, the focus of this paper.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous 
susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, utilizing GWAS and 
multi-omics data to identify high-confidence AD risk genes (ARGs) and druggable 
targets that can guide development of new therapeutics for patients suffering 
from AD has heretofore not been successful.
METHODS: To address this critical problem in the field, we have developed a 
network-based artificial intelligence framework that is capable of integrating 
multi-omics data along with human protein-protein interactome networks to 
accurately infer accurate drug targets impacted by GWAS-identified variants to 
identify new therapeutics. When applied to AD, this approach integrates GWAS 
findings, multi-omics data from brain samples of AD patients and AD transgenic 
animal models, drug-target networks, and the human protein-protein interactome, 
along with large-scale patient database validation and in vitro mechanistic 
observations in human microglia cells.
RESULTS: Through this approach, we identified 103 ARGs validated by various 
levels of pathobiological evidence in AD. Via network-based prediction and 
population-based validation, we then showed that three drugs (pioglitazone, 
febuxostat, and atenolol) are significantly associated with decreased risk of AD 
compared with matched control populations. Pioglitazone usage is significantly 
associated with decreased risk of AD (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.916, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.861-0.974, P = 0.005) in a retrospective case-control 
validation. Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) 
agonist used to treat type 2 diabetes, and propensity score matching cohort 
studies confirmed its association with reduced risk of AD in comparison to 
glipizide (HR = 0.921, 95% CI 0.862-0.984, P = 0.0159), an insulin secretagogue 
that is also used to treat type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments showed that 
pioglitazone downregulated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and 
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK5) in human microglia cells, supporting a possible 
mechanism-of-action for its beneficial effect in AD.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we present an integrated, network-based artificial 
intelligence methodology to rapidly translate GWAS findings and multi-omics data 
to genotype-informed therapeutic discovery in AD.

We describe a comprehensive and unique database 'Priority index' 
(Pi; http://pi.well.ox.ac.uk) of prioritized genes encoding potential 
therapeutic targets that encompasses all major immune-mediated diseases. We 
provide targets at the gene level, each receiving a 5-star rating supported 
by: genomic evidence arising from disease genome-wide associations and 
functional immunogenomics, annotation evidence using ontologies restricted to 
genes with genomic evidence, and network evidence from protein interactions. 
Target genes often act together in related molecular pathways. The underlying Pi 
approach is unique in identifying a network of highly rated genes that mediate 
pathway crosstalk. In the Pi website, disease-centric pages are specially 
designed to enable the users to browse a complete list of prioritized genes and 
also a manageable list of nodal genes at the pathway crosstalk level; both 
switchable by clicks. Moreover, target genes are cross-referenced and supported 
using additional information, particularly regarding tractability, including 
druggable pockets viewed in 3D within protein structures. Target genes highly 
rated across diseases suggest drug repurposing opportunity, while genes in 
a particular disease reveal disease-specific targeting potential. To facilitate 
the ease of such utility, cross-disease comparisons involving multiple diseases 
are also supported. This facility, together with the faceted search, enhances 
integrative mining of the Pi resource to accelerate early-stage 
therapeutic target identification and validation leveraging human genetics.

The Complex Portal (www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal) is a manually curated, 
encyclopaedic database of macromolecular complexes with known function from a 
range of model organisms. It summarizes complex composition, topology and 
function along with links to a large range of domain-specific resources (i.e. 
wwPDB, EMDB and Reactome). Since the last update in 2019, we have produced a 
first draft complexome for Escherichia coli, maintained and updated that of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, added over 40 coronavirus complexes and increased the 
human complexome to over 1100 complexes that include approximately 200 complexes 
that act as targets for viral proteins or are part of the immune system. The 
display of protein features in ComplexViewer has been improved and the 
participant table is now colour-coordinated with the nodes in ComplexViewer. 
Community collaboration has expanded, for example by contributing to an analysis 
of putative transcription cofactors and providing data accessible to semantic 
web tools through Wikidata which is now populated with manually curated Complex 
Portal content through a new bot. Our data license is now CC0 to encourage data 
reuse. Users are encouraged to get in touch, provide us with feedback and send 
curation requests through the 'Support' link.

Background: SLC30 family genes, also known as ZnT family genes, can keep 
cellular zinc levels within a physiological range by exporting zinc to 
extracellular space or by isolating zinc in the specific regions of cytoplasm 
when cellular zinc concentrations are elevated in human cells. There are growing 
evidences that dysregulated expression of SLC30 family genes can potentially 
influence tumorigenesis. However, the expression and prognostic value of SLC30 
family genes in cervical carcinoma are poorly characterized. Methods: In this 
study, we used many tools such as UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal, 
LinkedOmics, FunRich, Metascape, GeneMANIA, Open targets and TISIDB to perform 
bioinformatics analysis of SLC30 family genes in cervical carcinoma. Results: We 
found that the expression of SLC30A1/7/10 was significantly higher in cervical 
carcinoma than that in normal matched tissues, while SLC30A2/8 mRNA levels were 
decreased compared to normal tissues. For tumor stages, SLC30A1, SLC30A7 and 
SLC30A10 groups significantly varied. And a high expression of SLC30A1, SLC30A6, 
SLC30A8 and SLC30A10 was associated with worse overall survival in cervical 
carcinoma patients. Besides, we found that SLC30A1/10 may have a potential 
regulatory role in immune infiltration in cervical carcinoma. In addition, the 
results showed that the high expression of SLC30A1 was resistant to 79 drugs or 
small molecules; Two drugs (Neopeltolide and Tozasertib) can inhibit the high 
expression of SLC30A10 in cancers. Conclusion: SLC30A1 and SLC30A10 can be 
recognized as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets in 
cervical carcinoma.

Behavioral strategies require gating of premature responses to optimize 
outcomes. Several brain areas control impulsive actions, but the neuronal basis 
of natural variation in impulsivity between individuals remains largely unknown. 
Here, by combining a Go/No-Go behavioral assay with resting-state (rs) 
functional MRI in mice, we identified the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a known 
gate for motor control in the basal ganglia, as a major hotspot for trait 
impulsivity. In vivo recorded STN neural activity encoded impulsive action as a 
separable state from basic motor control, characterized by decoupled 
STN/substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) mesoscale networks. Optogenetic 
modulation of STN activity bidirectionally controlled impulsive behavior. 
Pharmacological and genetic manipulations showed that these impulsive actions 
are modulated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4) function in STN and 
its coupling to SNr in a behavioral trait-dependent manner, and independently of 
general motor function. In conclusion, STN circuitry multiplexes motor control 
and trait impulsivity, which are molecularly dissociated by mGlu4. This provides 
a potential mechanism for the genetic modulation of impulsive behavior, a 
clinically relevant predictor for developing psychiatric disorders associated 
with impulsivity.

SUMMARY: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) characterize the 
associations between genetic variation and gene expression to provide insights 
into tissue-specific gene regulation. Interactive visualization of 
tissue-specific eQTLs or splice QTLs (sQTLs) can facilitate our understanding of 
functional variants relevant to disease-related traits. However, combining the 
multi-dimensional nature of eQTLs/sQTLs into a concise and informative 
visualization is challenging. Existing QTL visualization tools provide useful 
ways to summarize the unprecedented scale of transcriptomic data but are not 
necessarily tailored to answer questions about the functional interpretations of 
trait-associated variants or other variants of interest. We developed FIVEx, an 
interactive eQTL/sQTL browser with an intuitive interface tailored to the 
functional interpretation of associated variants. It features the ability to 
navigate seamlessly between different data views while providing relevant 
tissue- and locus-specific information to offer users a better understanding of 
population-scale multi-tissue transcriptomic profiles. Our implementation of the 
FIVEx browser on the EBI eQTL catalogue, encompassing 16 publicly available 
RNA-seq studies, provides important insights for understanding potential 
tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms underlying trait-associated signals.

Approximately 450,000 cases of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are annually diagnosed 
worldwide, resulting in ~240,000 deaths. An augmented understanding of the 
common mechanisms of pathology among larger numbers of B-cell Non-Hodgkin's 
Lymphoma (BCNHL) patients is sorely needed. We consequently performed a large 
joint secondary transcriptomic analysis of the available BCNHL RNA-sequencing 
projects from GEO, consisting of 322 relevant samples across ten distinct public 
studies, to find common underlying mechanisms and biomarkers across multiple 
BCNHL subtypes and patient subpopulations; limitations may include lack of 
diversity in certain ethnicities and age groups and limited clinical subtype 
diversity due to sample availability. We found ~10,400 significant 
differentially expressed genes (FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05) and 33 
significantly modulated pathways (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05) when 
comparing BCNHL samples to non-diseased B-cell samples. Our findings included a 
significant class of proteoglycans not previously associated with lymphomas as 
well as significant modulation of genes that code for extracellular 
matrix-associated proteins. Our drug repurposing analysis predicted new 
candidates for repurposed drugs including ocriplasmin and collagenase. We also 
used a machine learning approach to identify robust BCNHL biomarkers that 
include YES1, FERMT2, and FAM98B, which have not previously been associated with 
BCNHL in the literature, but together provide ~99.9% combined specificity and 
sensitivity for differentiating lymphoma cells from healthy B-cells based on 
measurement of transcript expression levels in B-cells. This analysis supports 
past findings and validates existing knowledge while providing novel insights 
into the inner workings and mechanisms of transformed B-cell lymphomas that 
could give rise to improved diagnostics and/or therapeutics.

Genes and proteins form the basis of all cellular processes and ensure a smooth 
functioning of the human system. The diseases caused in humans can be either 
genetic in nature or may be caused due to external factors. Genetic diseases are 
mainly the result of any anomaly in gene/protein structure or function. This 
disruption interferes with the normal expression of cellular components. Against 
external factors, even though the immunogenicity of every individual protects 
them to a certain extent from infections, they are still susceptible to other 
disease-causing agents. Understanding the biological pathway/entities that could 
be targeted by specific drugs is an essential component of drug discovery. The 
traditional drug target discovery process is time-consuming and practically not 
feasible. A computational approach could provide speed and efficiency to the 
method. With the presence of vast biomedical literature, text mining also seems 
to be an obvious choice which could efficiently aid with other computational 
methods in identifying drug-gene targets. These could aid in initial stages of 
reviewing the disease components or can even aid parallel in extracting 
drug-disease-gene/protein relationships from literature. The present chapter 
aims at finding drug-gene interactions and how the information could be explored 
for drug interaction.

Stroke-related numbness and weakness (SRNW) are resultant symptoms of 
post-stroke sufferers. Existing research has supported the use of Huangqi Guizhi 
Wuwu Tang (HGWT) particularly for SRNW; however, their mechanisms of action have 
not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the 
mechanisms of action of HGWT components targeting SRNW-related proteins through 
a computational molecular docking approach. Target proteins associated with SRNW 
were identified through DrugBank database and Open Targets database. Chemical 
compounds from each herb of HGWT were identified from the Traditional Chinese 
Medicine Systems Pharmacology and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Autodock Vina was 
utilized and the cut-off criterion applied for protein-ligand complexes was a 
binding affinity score of ≤ -9.5 kcal/mol; selected protein-ligand complexes 
were identified using 3D and 2D structural analyses. The protein targets PDE5A 
and ESR1 have highlighted interactions with compounds (BS040, DZ006, DZ058, 
DZ118, and HQ066) which are the key molecules in the management of SRNW. PDE5A 
have bioactivity with the amino acid residues (Val230, Asn252, Gln133 and 
Thr166) throughout PDE5A-cGMP-PKG pathways which involved reduction in 
myofilament responsiveness. ESR1 were predicted to be critical active with site 
residue (Leu346, Glu419 and Leu387) and its proteoglycans pathway involving 
CD44v3/CD44 that activates rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) and ankyrin 
increasing vascular smooth muscle. In conclusion, HGWT may provide therapeutic 
benefits through strong interactions between herbal compounds and target 
proteins of PDE5A and ESR1. Further experimental studies are needed to 
unequivocally support this result which can be valuable to increase the quality 
of life of post-stroke patients. Keywords Herbal medicine, Complementary and 
alternative medicine, Natural product, Post-stroke, Computational analysis.

molecule generation, with a focus on the limitations of the application of AI 
therein and opportunities for improvement. Furthermore, we discuss the broader 
challenges imposed by AI in translating theoretical practice to real-world drug

This review provides the feasible literature on drug discovery through ML tools 
and techniques that are enforced in every phase of drug development to 
accelerate the research process and deduce the risk and expenditure in clinical 
trials. Machine learning techniques improve the decision-making in 
pharmaceutical data across various applications like QSAR analysis, hit 
discoveries, de novo drug architectures to retrieve accurate outcomes. Target 
validation, prognostic biomarkers, digital pathology are considered under 
problem statements in this review. ML challenges must be applicable for the main 
cause of inadequacy in interpretability outcomes that may restrict the 
applications in drug discovery. In clinical trials, absolute and methodological 
data must be generated to tackle many puzzles in validating ML techniques, 
improving decision-making, promoting awareness in ML approaches, and deducing 
risk failures in drug discovery.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate potential genetic biomarkers of peri-implantitis and 
target genes for the therapy of peri-implantitis by bioinformatics analysis of 
publicly available data.
METHODS: The GSE33774 microarray dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 
peri-implantitis and healthy gingival tissues were identified using the GEO2R 
tool. GO enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the DAVID database and the 
Metascape tool, and the results were expressed as a bubble diagram. The 
protein-protein interaction network of DEGs was constructed using the Search 
Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) and visualized using 
Cytoscape. The hub genes were screened by the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape. The 
potential target genes associated with peri-implantitis were obtained from the 
DisGeNET database and the Open Targets Platform. The intersecting genes were 
identified using the Venn diagram web tool.
RESULTS: Between the peri-implantitis group and the healthy group, 205 DEGs were 
investigated including 140 upregulated genes and 65 downregulated genes. These 
DEGs were mainly enriched in functions such as the immune response, inflammatory 
response, cell adhesion, receptor activity, and protease binding. The results of 
KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly involved in the 
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, pathways in cancer, and the PI3K-Akt 
signaling pathway. The intersecting genes, including IL6, TLR4, FN1, IL1β, 
CXCL8, MMP9, and SPP1, were revealed as potential genetic biomarkers and target 
genes of peri-implantitis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides supportive evidence that IL6, TLR4, FN1, IL1β, 
CXCL8, MMP9, and SPP1 might be used as potential target biomarkers for 
peri-implantitis which may provide further therapeutic potentials for 
peri-implantitis.

Background: Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is the third leading cause of 
cancer-related death and the sixth most common solid tumor worldwide. In the 
tumor microenvironment, the cross-talk between cancer cells, immune cells, and 
stromal cells exerts significant effects on neoplasia and tumor development and 
is modulated in part by chemokines. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligands (CCL) can 
directly target tumor cells and stromal cells, and they have been shown to 
regulate tumor cell proliferation, cancer stem-like cell properties, cancer 
invasiveness and metastasis, which directly and indirectly affect tumor immunity 
and influence cancer progression, therapy and patient outcomes. However, the 
prognostic values of chemokines CCL in LIHC have not been clarified. Methods: In 
this study, we comprehensively analyzed the relationship between transcriptional 
chemokines CCL and disease progression of LIHC using the ONCOMINE dataset, 
GEPIA, UALCAN, STRING, WebGestalt, GeneMANIA, TRRUST, DAVID 6.8, LinkedOmics, 
TIMER, GSCALite, and Open Targets. We validated the protein levels of chemokines 
CCL through western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: The transcriptional 
levels of CCL5/8/11/13/15/18/20/21/25/26/27/28 in LIHC tissues were 
significantly elevated while CCL2/3/4/14/23/24 were significantly reduced. A 
significant correlation was found between the expression of CCL14/25 and the 
pathological stage of LIHC patients. LIHC patients with low transcriptional 
levels of CCL14/21 were associated with a significantly poor prognosis. The 
functions of differentially expressed chemokines CCL were primarily related to 
the chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and 
TNF-α signaling pathway. Our data suggested that RELA/REL, NFKB1, STAT1/3/6, 
IRF3, SPI1, and JUN were key transcription factors for chemokines CCL. We found 
significant correlations among the expression of chemokines CCL and the 
infiltration of six types of immune cells (B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, 
macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells) and immune checkpoints (PD-1. 
PD-L1, and CTLA-4). The western blot and immunohistochemistry results showed 
that protein expression levels of CCL5 and CCL20 were upregulated in LIHC. CCL5 
and CCL20 were significantly correlated with the clinical outcome of patients 
with LIHC, and could be negatively regulated by some drugs or small molecules. 
Conclusions: Our results may provide novel insights for the potential suitable 
targets of immunological therapy and prognostic biomarkers for LIHC.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), oxidative stress (OS) is implicated in the 
neurodegenerative processes that occur from the beginning of the disease. 
Unchecked OS initiates a vicious circle caused by its crosstalk with 
inflammation, leading to demyelination, axonal damage and neuronal loss. The 
failure of MS antioxidant therapies relying on the use of endogenous and natural 
compounds drives the application of novel approaches to assess target relevance 
to the disease prior to preclinical testing of new drug candidates. To identify 
drugs that can act as regulators of intracellular oxidative homeostasis, we 
applied an in silico approach that links genome-wide MS associations and 
molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to proteins of the OS pathway. We found 
10 drugs with both central nervous system and oral bioavailability, targeting 
five out of the 21 top-scoring hits, including arginine methyltransferase 
(CARM1), which was first linked to MS. In particular, the direction of brain 
expression QTLs for CARM1 and protein kinase MAPK1 enabled us to select BIIB021 
and PEITC drugs with the required target modulation. Our study highlights 
OS-related molecules regulated by functional MS variants that could be targeted 
by existing drugs as a supplement to the approved disease-modifying treatments.

Background: White blood cell (WBC) traits and their subtypes such as basophil 
count (Bas), eosinophil count (Eos), lymphocyte count (Lym), monocyte count 
(Mon), and neutrophil counts (Neu) are known to be associated with diseases such 
as stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and coronary heart disease. Methods: We 
meta-analyze summary statistics from genome-wide association studies in 17,802 
participants from the African Partnership for Chronic Disease Research (APCDR) 
and African ancestry individuals from the Blood Cell Consortium (BCX2) using 
GWAMA. We further carried out a Bayesian fine mapping to identify causal 
variants driving the association with WBC subtypes. To access the causal 
relationship between WBC subtypes and asthma, we conducted a two-sample 
Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summary statistics of the Consortium 
on Asthma among African Ancestry Populations (CAAPA: n cases = 7,009, n control 
= 7,645) as our outcome phenotype. Results: Our metanalysis identified 269 loci 
at a genome-wide significant value of (p = 5 × 10-9) in a composite of the WBC 
subtypes while the Bayesian fine-mapping analysis identified genetic variants 
that are more causal than the sentinel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We 
found for the first time five novel genes (LOC126987/MTCO3P14, LINC01525, 
GAPDHP32/HSD3BP3, FLG-AS1/HMGN3P1, and TRK-CTT13-1/MGST3) not previously 
reported to be associated with any WBC subtype. Our MR analysis showed that Mon 
(IVW estimate = 0.38, CI: 0.221, 0.539, p < 0.001), Neu (IVW estimate = 0.189, 
CI: 0.133, 0.245, p < 0.001), and WBCc (IVW estimate = 0.185, CI: 0.108, 0.262, 
p < 0.001) are associated with increased risk of asthma. However, there was no 
evidence of causal relationship between Lym and asthma risk. Conclusion: This 
study provides insight into the relationship between some WBC subtypes and 
asthma and potential route in the treatment of asthma and may further inform a 
new therapeutic approach.

Despite the increasing global burden of neurological disorders, there is a lack 
of effective diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Proteins are often 
dysregulated in disease and have a strong genetic component. Here, we carry out 
a protein quantitative trait locus analysis of 184 neurologically-relevant 
proteins, using whole genome sequencing data from two isolated population-based 
cohorts (N = 2893). In doing so, we elucidate the genetic landscape of the 
circulating proteome and its connection to neurological disorders. We detect 214 
independently-associated variants for 107 proteins, the majority of which (76%) 
are cis-acting, including 114 variants that have not been previously identified. 
Using two-sample Mendelian randomisation, we identify causal associations 
between serum CD33 and Alzheimer's disease, GPNMB and Parkinson's disease, and 
MSR1 and schizophrenia, describing their clinical potential and highlighting 
drug repurposing opportunities.

We developed an endophenotype disease module-based methodology for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) drug repurposing and identified sildenafil as a potential disease 
risk modifier. Based on retrospective case-control pharmacoepidemiologic 
analyses of insurance claims data for 7.23 million individuals, we found that 
sildenafil usage was significantly associated with a 69% reduced risk of AD 
(hazard ratio = 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.39, P<1.0×10-8). Propensity 
score stratified analyses confirmed that sildenafil is significantly associated 
with a decreased risk of AD across all four drug cohorts we tested (diltiazem, 
glimepiride, losartan and metformin) after adjusting age, sex, race, and disease 
comorbidities. We also found that sildenafil increases neurite growth and 
decreases phospho-tau expression in AD patient-induced pluripotent stem 
cells-derived neuron models, supporting mechanistically its potential beneficial 
effect in Alzheimer's disease. The association between sildenafil use and 
decreased incidence of AD does not establish causality or its direction, which 
requires a randomized clinical trial approach.

Cell-surface proteins (SPs) are a rich source of immune and targeted therapies. 
By systematically integrating single-cell and bulk genomics, functional studies 
and target actionability, in the present study we comprehensively identify and 
annotate genes encoding SPs (GESPs) pan-cancer. We characterize GESP expression 
patterns, recurrent genomic alterations, essentiality, receptor-ligand 
interactions and therapeutic potential. We also find that mRNA expression of 
GESPs is cancer-type specific and positively correlates with protein expression, 
and that certain GESP subgroups function as common or specific essential genes 
for tumor cell growth. We also predict receptor-ligand interactions 
substantially deregulated in cancer and, using systems biology approaches, we 
identify cancer-specific GESPs with therapeutic potential. We have made this 
resource available through the Cancer Surfaceome Atlas ( 
http://fcgportal.org/TCSA ) within the Functional Cancer Genome data portal.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a rare but serious 
drug-related adverse event. To identify pharmacogenomic markers of MRONJ 
associated with bisphosphonate therapy, we conducted a genomewide association 
study (GWAS) meta-analysis followed by functional analysis of 5,008 individuals 
of European ancestry treated with bisphosphonates, which includes the largest 
number of MRONJ cases to date (444 cases and 4,564 controls). Discovery GWAS was 
performed in randomly selected 70% of the patients with cancer and replication 
GWAS was performed in the remaining 30% of the patients with cancer treated with 
intravenous bisphosphonates followed by meta-analysis of all 3,639 patients with 
cancer. GWAS was also performed in 1,369 patients with osteoporosis treated with 
oral bisphosphonates. The lead single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2736308 
on chromosome 8, was associated with an increased risk of MRONJ with an odds 
ratio (OR) of 2.71 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.90-3.86 (P = 3.57*10-8 
) in the meta-analysis of patients with cancer. This SNP was validated in the 
MRONJ GWAS in patients with osteoporosis (OR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.55-4.09, 
P = 6.84*10-4 ). The meta-analysis combining patients with cancer and patients 
with osteoporosis yielded the same lead SNP rs2736308 on chromosome 8 as the top 
SNP (OR: 2.74, 95% CI: 2.09-3.39, P = 9.65*10-11 ). This locus is associated 
with regulation of the BLK, CTSB, and FDFT1 genes, which had been associated 
with bone mineral density. FDFT1 encodes a membrane-associated enzyme, which is 
implicated in the bisphosphonate pathway. This study provides insights into the 
potential mechanism of MRONJ.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this investigation was the detailed analysis of the human 
pulp proteome using the new picosecond infrared laser (PIRL)-based sampling 
technique, which is based on a completely different mechanism compared to 
mechanical sampling. Proteome analysis of healthy pulp can provide data to 
define changes in the proteome associated with dental disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Immediately after extraction of the entire, undamaged 
tooth, 15 wisdom teeth were deep frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at 
-80°C. Teeth were crushed, and the excised frozen pulps were conditioned for 
further analysis. The pulps were sampled using PIRL, and the aspirates digested 
with trypsin and analyzed with mass spectrometry. Pulp proteins were categorized 
according to their gene ontology terminus. Proteins identified exclusively in 
this study were searched in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) for gaining 
information about the main known localization and function.
RESULTS: A total of 1348 proteins were identified in this study. The comparison 
with prior studies showed a match of 72%. Twenty-eight percent of the proteins 
were identified exclusively in this study. Considering HPA, almost half of these 
proteins were assigned to tissues that could be pulp specific.
CONCLUSION: PIRL is releasing proteins from the dental pulp which are not 
dissolved by conventional sampling techniques. Clinical Relevance The presented 
data extend current knowledge on dental pulp proteomics in healthy teeth and can 
serve as a reference for studies on pulp proteomics in dental disease.

Scientific research consistently demonstrates that diseases may be delayed, 
treated, or even prevented and, thereby, health may be maintained with 
health-promoting functional food ingredients (FFIs). Consumers are increasingly 
demanding sound information about food, nutrition, nutrients, and their 
associated health benefits. Consequently, a nutrition industry is being formed 
around natural foods and FFIs, the economic growth of which is increasingly 
driven by consumer decisions. Information technology, in particular artificial 
intelligence (AI), is primed to vastly expand the pool of characterised and 
annotated FFIs available to consumers, by systematically discovering and 
characterising natural, efficacious, and safe bioactive ingredients (bioactives) 
that address specific health needs. However, FFI-producing companies are lagging 
in adopting AI technology for their ingredient development pipelines for several 
reasons, resulting in a lack of efficient means for large-scale and 
high-throughput molecular and functional ingredient characterisation. The 
arrival of the AI-led technological revolution allows for the comprehensive 
characterisation and understanding of the universe of FFI molecules, enabling 
the mining of the food and natural product space in an unprecedented manner. In 
turn, this expansion of bioactives dramatically increases the repertoire of FFIs 
available to the consumer, ultimately resulting in bioactives being specifically 
developed to target unmet health needs.

Nutrition appears to be an important environmental factor involved in the onset 
of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) through yet poorly understood biological 
mechanisms. Most studies focused on fat content in high caloric diets, while 
refined sugars represent up to 40% of caloric intake within industrialized 
countries and contribute to the growing epidemics of inflammatory diseases. 
Herein we aim to better understand the impact of a high-fat-high-sucrose diet on 
intestinal homeostasis in healthy conditions and the subsequent colitis risk. We 
investigated the early events and the potential reversibility of high caloric 
diet-induced damage in mice before experimental colitis. C57BL/6 mice were fed 
with a high-fat or high-fat high-sucrose or control diet before experimental 
colitis. In healthy mice, a high-fat high-sucrose diet induces a pre-IBD state 
characterized by gut microbiota dysbiosis with a total depletion of bacteria 
belonging to Barnesiella that is associated with subclinical endoscopic lesions. 
An overall down-regulation of the colonic transcriptome converged with broadly 
decreased immune cell populations in the mesenteric lymph nodes leading to the 
inability to respond to tissue injury. Such in-vivo effects on microbiome and 
transcriptome were partially restored when returning to normal chow. Long-term 
consumption of diet enriched in sucrose and fat predisposes mice to colitis. 
This enhanced risk is preceded by gut microbiota dysbiosis and transcriptional 
reprogramming of colonic genes related to IBD. Importantly, diet-induced 
transcriptome and microbiome disturbances are partially reversible after 
switching back to normal chow with persistent sequelae that may contribute to 
IBD predisposition in the general population.

Characterization of the genetic regulation of proteins is essential for 
understanding disease etiology and developing therapies. We identified 10,674 
genetic associations for 3892 plasma proteins to create a cis-anchored 
gene-protein-disease map of 1859 connections that highlights strong 
cross-disease biological convergence. This proteo-genomic map provides a 
framework to connect etiologically related diseases, to provide biological 
context for new or emerging disorders, and to integrate different biological 
domains to establish mechanisms for known gene-disease links. Our results 
identify proteo-genomic connections within and between diseases and establish 
the value of cis-protein variants for annotation of likely causal disease genes 
at loci identified in genome-wide association studies, thereby addressing a 
major barrier to experimental validation and clinical translation of genetic 
discoveries.

Typical clustering analysis for large-scale genomics data combines two 
unsupervised learning techniques: dimensionality reduction and clustering 
(DR-CL) methods. It has been demonstrated that transforming gene expression to 
pathway-level information can improve the robustness and interpretability of 
disease grouping results. This approach, referred to as biological 
knowledge-driven clustering (BK-CL) approach, is often neglected, due to a lack 
of tools enabling systematic comparisons with more established DR-based methods. 
Moreover, classic clustering metrics based on group separability tend to favor 
the DR-CL paradigm, which may increase the risk of identifying less actionable 
disease subtypes that have ambiguous biological and clinical explanations. 
Hence, there is a need for developing metrics that assess biological and 
clinical relevance. To facilitate the systematic analysis of BK-CL methods, we 
propose a computational protocol for quantitative analysis of clustering results 
derived from both DR-CL and BK-CL methods. Moreover, we propose a new BK-CL 
method that combines prior knowledge of disease relevant genes, network 
diffusion algorithms and gene set enrichment analysis to generate robust 
pathway-level information. Benchmarking studies were conducted to compare the 
grouping results from different DR-CL and BK-CL approaches with respect to 
standard clustering evaluation metrics, concordance with known subtypes, 
association with clinical outcomes and disease modules in co-expression networks 
of genes. No single approach dominated every metric, showing the importance 
multi-objective evaluation in clustering analysis. However, we demonstrated 
that, on gene expression data sets derived from TCGA samples, the BK-CL approach 
can find groupings that provide significant prognostic value in both breast and 
prostate cancers.

MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies can reveal important 
genotype-phenotype associations; however, data quality and interpretability 
issues must be addressed. For drug discovery scientists seeking to prioritize 
targets based on the available evidence, these issues go beyond the single 
study.
RESULTS: Here, we describe rational ranking, filtering and interpretation of 
inferred gene-trait associations and data aggregation across studies by 
leveraging existing curation and harmonization efforts. Each gene-trait 
association is evaluated for confidence, with scores derived solely from 
aggregated statistics, linking a protein-coding gene and phenotype. We propose a 
method for assessing confidence in gene-trait associations from evidence 
aggregated across studies, including a bibliometric assessment of scientific 
consensus based on the iCite relative citation ratio, and meanRank scores, to 
aggregate multivariate evidence.This method, intended for drug target hypothesis 
generation, scoring and ranking, has been implemented as an analytical pipeline, 
available as open source, with public datasets of results, and a web application 
designed for usability by drug discovery scientists.

Graph machine learning (GML) is receiving growing interest within the 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries for its ability to model 
biomolecular structures, the functional relationships between them, and 
integrate multi-omic datasets - amongst other data types. Herein, we present a 
multidisciplinary academic-industrial review of the topic within the context of 
drug discovery and development. After introducing key terms and modelling 
approaches, we move chronologically through the drug development pipeline to 
identify and summarize work incorporating: target identification, design of 
small molecules and biologics, and drug repurposing. Whilst the field is still 
emerging, key milestones including repurposed drugs entering in vivo studies, 
suggest GML will become a modelling framework of choice within biomedical 
machine learning.

Drug repositioning is a drug discovery strategy in which an existing drug is 
utilized as a therapeutic agent for a different disease. As information 
regarding the safety, pharmacokinetics, and formulation of existing drugs is 
already available, the cost and time required for drug development is reduced. 
Conventional drug repositioning has been dominated by a method involving the 
search for candidate drugs that act on the target molecules of an organism in a 
diseased state through basic research. However, recently, information hosted on 
medical information and life science databases have been used in translational 
research to bridge the gap between basic research in drug repositioning and 
clinical application. Here, we review an example of drug repositioning wherein 
candidate drugs were found and their mechanisms of action against a novel 
therapeutic target were identified via a basic research method that combines the 
findings retrieved from various medical and life science databases.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many variants associated 
with complex traits, but identifying the causal gene(s) is a major challenge. In 
the present study, we present an open resource that provides systematic fine 
mapping and gene prioritization across 133,441 published human GWAS loci. We 
integrate genetics (GWAS Catalog and UK Biobank) with transcriptomic, proteomic 
and epigenomic data, including systematic disease-disease and disease-molecular 
trait colocalization results across 92 cell types and tissues. We identify 729 
loci fine mapped to a single-coding causal variant and colocalized with a single 
gene. We trained a machine-learning model using the fine-mapped genetics and 
functional genomics data and 445 gold-standard curated GWAS loci to distinguish 
causal genes from neighboring genes, outperforming a naive distance-based model. 
Our prioritized genes were enriched for known approved drug targets (odds 
ratio = 8.1, 95% confidence interval = 5.7, 11.5). These results are publicly 
available through a web portal ( http://genetics.opentargets.org ), enabling 
users to easily prioritize genes at disease-associated loci and assess their 
potential as drug targets.

The study of parental lifespan has emerged as an innovative tool to advance 
aging biology and our understanding of the genetic architecture of human 
longevity and aging-associated diseases. Here, we leveraged summary statistics 
of a genome-wide association study including over one million parental lifespans 
to identify genetically regulated genes from the Genotype-Tissue Expression 
project. Through a combination of multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association 
analyses and genetic colocalization, we identified novel genes that may be 
associated with parental lifespan. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses also 
identified circulating proteins and metabolites causally associated with 
parental lifespan and chronic diseases offering new drug repositioning 
opportunities such as those targeting apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins. 
Liver expression of HP, the gene encoding haptoglobin, and plasma haptoglobin 
levels were causally linked with parental lifespan. Phenome-wide MR analyses 
were used to map genetically regulated genes, proteins and metabolites with 
other human traits as well as the disease-related phenome in the FinnGen cohorts 
(n = 135,638). Altogether, this study identified new candidate genes, 
circulating proteins and metabolites that may influence human aging as well as 
potential therapeutic targets for chronic diseases that warrant further 
investigation.

The FDA approval of imatinib in 2001 was a breakthrough in molecularly targeted 
cancer therapy and heralded the emergence of kinase inhibitors as a key drug 
class in the oncology area and beyond. Twenty years on, this article analyses 
the landscape of approved and investigational therapies that target kinases and 
trends within it, including the most popular targets of kinase inhibitors and 
their expanding range of indications. There are currently 71 small-molecule 
kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) approved by the FDA and an additional 16 SMKIs 
approved by other regulatory agencies. Although oncology is still the 
predominant area for their application, there have been important approvals for 
indications such as rheumatoid arthritis, and one-third of the SMKIs in clinical 
development address disorders beyond oncology. Information on clinical trials of 
SMKIs reveals that approximately 110 novel kinases are currently being explored 
as targets, which together with the approximately 45 targets of approved kinase 
inhibitors represent only about 30% of the human kinome, indicating that there 
are still substantial unexplored opportunities for this drug class. We also 
discuss trends in kinase inhibitor design, including the development of 
allosteric and covalent inhibitors, bifunctional inhibitors and chemical 
degraders.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify the potential circulating biomarkers of 
protein, mRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to differentiate the 
papillary thyroid cancers from benign thyroid tumors.
METHODS: The study population of 100 patients was classified into identification 
(10 patients with papillary thyroid cancers and 10 patients with benign thyroid 
tumors) and validation groups (45 patients with papillary thyroid cancers and 35 
patients with benign thyroid tumors). The Sengenics Immunome Protein 
Array-combined data mining approach using the Open Targets Platform was used to 
identify the putative protein biomarkers, and their expression validated using 
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Next-generation sequencing by Illumina 
HiSeq was used for the detection of dysregulated mRNAs and lncRNAs. The website 
Timer v2.0 helped identify the putative mRNA biomarkers, which were 
significantly over-expressed in papillary thyroid cancers than in adjacent 
normal thyroid tissue. The mRNA and lncRNA biomarker expression was validated by 
a real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Although putative protein and mRNA biomarkers have been identified, 
their serum expression could not be confirmed in the validation cohorts. In 
addition, seven lncRNAs (TCONS_00516490, TCONS_00336559, TCONS_00311568, 
TCONS_00321917, TCONS_00336522, TCONS_00282483, and TCONS_00494326) were 
identified and validated as significantly downregulated in patients with 
papillary thyroid cancers compared to those with benign thyroid tumors. These 
seven lncRNAs showed moderate accuracy based on the area under the curve 
(AUC = 0.736) of receiver operating characteristic in predicting the occurrence 
of papillary thyroid cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified seven downregulated circulating lncRNAs with the 
potential for predicting the occurrence of papillary thyroid cancers.

The multi-domain non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) is an oncogenic molecule that 
has been concomitantly implicated in the progression of coronavirus infection. 
However, its oncological role in lung cancer and whether it plays a role in 
modulating the tumor immune microenvironment is not properly understood. In the 
present in silico study, we demonstrated that NSP3 (SH2D3C) is associated with 
advanced stage and poor prognoses of lung cancer cohorts. Genetic alterations of 
NSP3 (SH2D3C) co-occurred inversely with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) 
alterations and elicited its pathological role via modulation of various 
components of the immune and inflammatory pathways in lung cancer. Our 
correlation analysis suggested that NSP3 (SH2D3C) promotes tumor immune evasion 
via dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes and T-cell exclusion mechanisms in lung 
cancer patients. NSP3 (SH2D3C) demonstrated a high predictive value and 
association with therapy resistance in lung cancer, hence serving as an 
attractive target for therapy exploration. We evaluated the in silico 
drug-likeness and NSP3 (SH2D3C) target efficacy of six organosulfur small 
molecules from Allium sativum using a molecular docking study. We found that the 
six organosulfur compounds demonstrated selective cytotoxic potential against 
cancer cell lines and good predictions for ADMET properties, drug-likeness, and 
safety profile. E-ajoene, alliin, diallyl sulfide, 2-vinyl-4H-1,3-dithiin, 
allicin, and S-allyl-cysteine docked well into the NSP3 (SH2D3C)-binding cavity 
with binding affinities ranging from -4.3~-6.70 Ă and random forest (RF) scores 
ranging from 4.31~5.26 pKd. However, S-allyl-cysteine interaction with NSP3 
(SH2D3C) is unfavorable and hence less susceptible to NSP3 ligandability. In 
conclusion, our study revealed that NSP3 is an important onco-immunological 
biomarker encompassing the tumor microenvironment, disease staging and prognosis 
in lung cancer and could serve as an attractive target for cancer therapy. The 
organosulfur compounds from A. sativum have molecular properties to efficiently 
interact with the binding site of NSP3 and are currently under vigorous 
preclinical study in our laboratory.

BACKGROUND: In spite of many years of research, our understanding of the 
molecular bases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still incomplete, and the medical 
treatments available mainly target the disease symptoms and are hardly 
effective. Indeed, the modulation of a single target (e.g., β-secretase) has 
proven to be insufficient to significantly alter the physiopathology of the 
disease, and we should therefore move from gene-centric to systemic therapeutic 
strategies, where AD-related changes are modulated globally.
METHODS: Here we present the complete characterization of three murine models of 
AD at different stages of the disease (i.e., onset, progression and advanced). 
We combined the cognitive assessment of these mice with histological analyses 
and full transcriptional and protein quantification profiling of the 
hippocampus. Additionally, we derived specific Aβ-related molecular AD 
signatures and looked for drugs able to globally revert them.
RESULTS: We found that AD models show accelerated aging and that factors 
specifically associated with Aβ pathology are involved. We discovered a few 
proteins whose abundance increases with AD progression, while the corresponding 
transcript levels remain stable, and showed that at least two of them (i.e., 
lfit3 and Syt11) co-localize with Aβ plaques in the brain. Finally, we found two 
NSAIDs (dexketoprofen and etodolac) and two anti-hypertensives (penbutolol and 
bendroflumethiazide) that overturn the cognitive impairment in AD mice while 
reducing Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and partially restoring the physiological 
levels of AD signature genes to wild-type levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The characterization of three AD mouse models at different disease 
stages provides an unprecedented view of AD pathology and how this differs from 
physiological aging. Moreover, our computational strategy to chemically revert 
AD signatures has shown that NSAID and anti-hypertensive drugs may still have an 
opportunity as anti-AD agents, challenging previous reports.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed sixteen risk loci for 
endoemtrial cancer but the identification of candidate susceptibility genes 
remains challenging. Here, we perform transcriptome-wide association study 
(TWAS) analyses using the largest endometrial cancer GWAS and gene expression 
from six relevant tissues, prioritizing eight candidate endometrial cancer 
susceptibility genes, one of which (EEFSEC) is located at a potentially novel 
endometrial cancer risk locus. We also show evidence of biologically relevant 
tissue-specific expression associations for CYP19A1 (adipose), HEY2 (ovary) and 
SKAP1 (whole blood). A phenome-wide association study demonstrates associations 
of candidate susceptibility genes with anthropometric, cardiovascular, diabetes, 
bone health and sex hormone traits that are related to endometrial cancer risk 
factors. Lastly, analysis of TWAS data highlights candidate compounds for 
endometrial cancer repurposing. In summary, this study reveals endometrial 
cancer susceptibility genes, including those with evidence of tissue 
specificity, providing insights into endometrial cancer aetiology and avenues 
for therapeutic development.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic 
variants that are associated with complex traits. However, a stringent 
significance threshold is required to identify robust genetic associations. 
Leveraging relevant auxiliary covariates has the potential to boost statistical 
power to exceed the significance threshold. Particularly, abundant pleiotropy 
and the non-random distribution of SNPs across various functional categories 
suggests that leveraging GWAS test statistics from related traits and/or 
functional genomic data may boost GWAS discovery. While type 1 error rate 
control has become standard in GWAS, control of the false discovery rate can be 
a more powerful approach. The conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) extends 
the standard FDR framework by conditioning on auxiliary data to call significant 
associations, but current implementations are restricted to auxiliary data 
satisfying specific parametric distributions, typically GWAS p-values for 
related traits. We relax these distributional assumptions, enabling an extension 
of the cFDR framework that supports auxiliary covariates from arbitrary 
continuous distributions ("Flexible cFDR"). Our method can be applied 
iteratively, thereby supporting multi-dimensional covariate data. Through 
simulations we show that Flexible cFDR increases sensitivity whilst controlling 
FDR after one or several iterations. We further demonstrate its practical 
potential through application to an asthma GWAS, leveraging various functional 
genomic data to find additional genetic associations for asthma, which we 
validate in the larger, independent, UK Biobank data resource.

Asthma affects more than 300 million people globally and is both under diagnosed 
and under treated. The most recent and largest genome-wide association study 
investigating moderate to severe asthma to date was carried out in 2019 and 
identified 25 independent signals. However, as new and in-depth downstream 
databases become available, the translational analysis of these signals into 
target genes and pathways is timely. In this study, unique (U-BIOPRED) and 
publicly available datasets (HaploReg, Open Target Genetics and GTEx) were 
investigated for the 25 GWAS signals to identify 37 candidate causal genes. 
Additional traits associated with these signals were identified through PheWAS 
using the UK Biobank resource, with asthma and eosinophilic traits amongst the 
strongest associated. Gene expression omnibus dataset examination identified 13 
candidate genes with altered expression profiles in the airways and blood of 
asthmatic subjects, including MUC5AC and STAT6. Gene expression analysis through 
publicly available datasets highlighted lung tissue cell specific expression, 
with both MUC5AC and SLC22A4 genes showing enriched expression in ciliated 
cells. Gene enrichment pathway and interaction analysis highlighted the 
dominance of the HLA-DQA1/A2/B1/B2 gene cluster across many immunological 
diseases including asthma, type I diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. 
Interaction and prediction analyses found IL33 and IL18R1 to be key 
co-localization partners for other genes, predicted that CD274 forms 
co-expression relationships with 13 other genes, including the HLA-DQA1/A2/B1/B2 
gene cluster and that MUC5AC and IL37 are co-expressed. Drug interaction 
analysis revealed that 11 of the candidate genes have an interaction with 
available therapeutics. This study provides significant insight into these GWAS 
signals in the context of cell expression, function, and disease relationship 
with the view of informing future research and drug development efforts for 
moderate-severe asthma.

Endometrial cancer (EC) mortality is directly associated with the presence of 
prognostic factors. Current stratification systems are not accurate enough to 
predict the outcome of patients. Therefore, identifying more accurate prognostic 
EC biomarkers is crucial. We aimed to validate 255 prognostic biomarkers 
identified in multiple studies and explore their prognostic application by 
analyzing them in TCGA and CPTAC datasets. We analyzed the mRNA and proteomic 
expression data to assess the statistical prognostic performance of the 255 
proteins. Significant biomarkers related to overall survival (OS) and 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) were combined and signatures generated. A total 
of 30 biomarkers were associated either to one or more of the following 
prognostic factors: histological type (n = 15), histological grade (n = 6), FIGO 
stage (n = 1), molecular classification (n = 16), or they were associated to OS 
(n = 11), and RFS (n = 5). A prognostic signature composed of 11 proteins 
increased the accuracy to predict OS (AUC = 0.827). The study validates and 
identifies new potential applications of 30 proteins as prognostic biomarkers 
and suggests to further study under-studied biomarkers such as TPX2, and 
confirms already used biomarkers such as MSH6, MSH2, or L1CAM. These results are 
expected to advance the quest for biomarkers to accurately assess the risk of EC 
patients.

OBJECTIVE: Osteosarcoma is one of the most common types of bone sarcoma with a 
poor prognosis. However, identifying the predictive factors that contribute to 
the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains a significant challenge.
METHODS: A public data series (GSE87437) was downloaded to identify 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed lncRNAs 
(DElncRNAs) between osteosarcoma patients that do and do not respond to 
preoperative chemotherapy. Subsequently, functional analysis of the 
transcriptome expression profile, regulatory networks of DEGs and DElncRNAs, 
competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) and protein-protein interaction networks were 
performed. Furthermore, the function, pathway, and survival analysis of hub 
genes was performed and drug and disease relationship prediction of DElncRNA was 
carried out.
RESULTS: A total of 626 DEGs, 26 DElncRNAs, and 18 hub genes were identified. 
However, only one gene and two lncRNAs were found to be suitable as candidate 
gene and lncRNAs respectively.
CONCLUSION: The DEGs, hub genes, candidate gene, and candidate lncRNAs screened 
out in this context were considered as potential biomarkers for the response to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy of osteosarcoma.

Familial melanoma accounts for 10% of cases, being CDKN2A the main high-risk 
gene. However, the mechanisms underlying melanomagenesis in these cases remain 
poorly understood. Our aim was to analyze the transcriptome of 
melanocyte-keratinocyte co-cultures derived from healthy skin from familial 
melanoma patients vs. controls, to unveil pathways involved in melanoma 
development in at-risk individuals. Accordingly, primary melanocyte-keratinocyte 
co-cultures were established from the healthy skin biopsies of 16 unrelated 
familial melanoma patients (8 CDKN2A mutant, 8 CDKN2A wild-type) and 7 healthy 
controls. Whole transcriptome was captured using the SurePrint G3 Human 
Microarray. Transcriptome analyses included: differential gene expression, 
functional enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We 
identified a gene profile associated with familial melanoma independently of 
CDKN2A germline status. Functional enrichment analysis of this profile showed a 
downregulation of pathways related to DNA repair and immune response in familial 
melanoma (P < 0.05). In addition, the PPI network analysis revealed a network 
that consisted of double-stranded DNA repair genes (including BRCA1, BRCA2, 
BRIP1, and FANCA), immune response genes, and regulation of chromosome 
segregation. The hub gene was BRCA1. In conclusion, the constitutive 
deregulation of BRCA1 pathway genes and the immune response in healthy skin 
could be a mechanism related to melanoma risk.

Amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) forms the 
amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) component of pathognomonic extracellular plaques of AD. 
Additional early cortical changes in AD include neuroinflammation and elevated 
iron levels. Activation of the innate immune system in the brain is a 
neuroprotective response to infection; however, persistent neuroinflammation is 
linked to AD neuropathology by uncertain mechanisms. Non-parametric machine 
learning analysis on transcriptomic data from a large neuropathologically 
characterised patient cohort revealed the acute phase protein lactoferrin (Lf) 
as the key predictor of amyloid pathology. In vitro studies showed that an 
interaction between APP and the iron-bound form of Lf secreted from activated 
microglia diverted neuronal APP endocytosis from the canonical 
clathrin-dependent pathway to one requiring ADP ribosylation factor 6 
trafficking. By rerouting APP recycling to the Rab11-positive compartment for 
amyloidogenic processing, Lf dramatically increased neuronal Aβ production. Lf 
emerges as a novel pharmacological target for AD that not only modulates APP 
processing but provides a link between Aβ production, neuroinflammation and iron 
dysregulation.

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are an emerging drug modality that may 
offer new opportunities to circumvent some of the limitations associated with 
traditional small-molecule therapeutics. By analogy with the concept of the 
'druggable genome', the question arises as to which potential drug targets might 
PROTAC-mediated protein degradation be most applicable. Here, we present a 
systematic approach to the assessment of the PROTAC tractability 
(PROTACtability) of protein targets using a series of criteria based on data and 
information from a diverse range of relevant publicly available resources. Our 
approach could support decision-making on whether or not a particular target may 
be amenable to modulation using a PROTAC. Using our approach, we identified 
1,067 proteins of the human proteome that have not yet been described in the 
literature as PROTAC targets that offer potential opportunities for future 
PROTAC-based efforts.

In the assembly of biological networks it is important to provide reliable 
interactions in an effort to have the most possible accurate representation of 
real-life systems. Commonly, the data used to build a network comes from diverse 
high-throughput essays, however most of the interaction data is available 
through scientific literature. This has become a challenge with the notable 
increase in scientific literature being published, as it is hard for human 
curators to track all recent discoveries without using efficient tools to help 
them identify these interactions in an automatic way. This can be surpassed by 
using text mining approaches which are capable of extracting knowledge from 
scientific documents. One of the most important tasks in text mining for 
biological network building is relation extraction, which identifies relations 
between the entities of interest. Many interaction databases already use text 
mining systems, and the development of these tools will lead to more reliable 
networks, as well as the possibility to personalize the networks by selecting 
the desired relations. This review will focus on different approaches of 
automatic information extraction from biomedical text that can be used to 
enhance existing networks or create new ones, such as deep learning 
state-of-the-art approaches, focusing on cancer disease as a case-study.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and disabling 
mental disorders worldwide. Among the symptoms of MDD, sleep disturbance such as 
insomnia is prominent, and the first reason patients may seek professional help. 
However, the underlying pathophysiology of this comorbidity is still elusive. 
Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unveil the 
genetic background of several psychiatric disorders, including MDD and insomnia. 
Identifying the shared genomic risk loci between comorbid psychiatric disorders 
could be a valuable strategy to understanding their comorbidity. This study 
seeks to identify the shared genes and biological pathways between MDD and 
insomnia based on their shared genetic variants. First, we performed a 
meta-analysis based on the GWAS summary statistics of MDD and insomnia obtained 
from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and UK Biobank, respectively. Next, we 
associated shared genetic variants to genes using two gene mapping strategies: 
(a) positional mapping based on genomic proximity and (b) expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping based on gene expression linkage across 
multiple tissues. As a result, a total of 719 shared genes were identified. Over 
half (51%) of them are protein-coding genes. Functional enrichment analysis 
shows that the most enriched biological pathways are related to epigenetic 
modification, sensory perception, and immunologic signatures. We also identified 
druggable targets using a network approach. Together, these results may provide 
insights into understanding the genetic predisposition and underlying biological 
pathways of comorbid MDD and insomnia symptoms.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of neurodegenerative 
dementia and affects nearly 50 million people worldwide. Early stage diagnosis 
of AD is challenging, and there is presently no effective treatment for AD. The 
specific genetic alterations and pathological mechanisms of the development and 
progression of dementia remain poorly understood. Therefore, identifying 
essential genes and molecular pathways that are associated with this disease's 
pathogenesis will help uncover potential treatments. In an attempt to achieve a 
more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AD, we 
integrated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from six microarray 
datasets of AD patients and controls. We identified ATPase H+ transporting V1 
subunit A (ATP6V1A), BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase IV (CAMK4), TOR signaling pathway regulator-like (TIPRL), and the 
translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70 (TOMM70) as upregulated DEGs 
common to the five datasets. Our analyses revealed that these genes exhibited 
brain-specific gene co-expression clustering with OPA1, ITFG1, OXCT1, ATP2A2, 
MAPK1, CDK14, MAP2K4, YWHAB, PARK2, CMAS, HSPA12A, and RGS17. Taking the mean 
relative expression levels of this geneset in different brain regions into 
account, we found that the frontal cortex (BA9) exhibited significantly (p < 
0.05) higher expression levels of these DEGs, while the hippocampus exhibited 
the lowest levels. These DEGs are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, 
inflammation processes, and various pathways involved in the pathogenesis of AD. 
Finally, our blood-brain barrier (BBB) predictions using the support vector 
machine (SVM) and LiCABEDS algorithm and molecular docking analysis suggested 
that antrocin is permeable to the BBB and exhibits robust ligand-receptor 
interactions with high binding affinities to CAMK4, TOMM70, and T1PRL. Our 
results also revealed good predictions for ADMET properties, drug-likeness, 
adherence to Lipinskís rules, and no alerts for pan-assay interference compounds 
(PAINS) Conclusions: These results suggest a new molecular signature for AD 
parthenogenesis and antrocin as a potential therapeutic agent. Further 
investigation is warranted.

Systems pharmacology employs computational and mathematical methods to study the 
network of interactions a drug may have within complex biological pathways. 
These tools are well suited for research on multitarget drugs, such as natural 
compounds, in diseases with complex etiologies, such as osteoarthritis (OA). The 
present study focuses on cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive constituent of 
cannabis, targeting over 60 distinct molecular targets as a potential treatment 
for OA, a degenerative joint disease leading to chronic pain with a neuropathic 
component. We successfully identified molecular targets of CBD that were 
relevant in the context of OA treatment with both beneficial and detrimental 
effects. Our findings were confirmed by in vivo and molecular studies. A key 
role of PPARγ in mediating the therapeutic potential of CBD was revealed, 
whereas upregulation of multiple transient receptor potential channels demasked 
CBD-induced heat hyperalgesia. Our findings pave the way for novel CBD-based 
therapy with improved therapeutic potential but also encourage the use of 
bioinformatic tools to predict the mechanism of action of CBD in different 
conditions. We have also created an accessible web tool for analogous analysis 
of CBD pharmacology in the context of any disease of interest and made it 
publicly available.

BACKGROUND: Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the two most 
prevalent lung cancer types, and their distinction requires different 
screenings, such as the visual inspection of histology slides by an expert 
pathologist, the analysis of gene expression or computer tomography scans, among 
others. In recent years, there has been an increasing gathering of biological 
data for decision support systems in the diagnosis (e.g. histology imaging, 
next-generation sequencing technologies data, clinical information, etc.). Using 
all these sources to design integrative classification approaches may improve 
the final diagnosis of a patient, in the same way that doctors can use multiple 
types of screenings to reach a final decision on the diagnosis. In this work, we 
present a late fusion classification model using histology and RNA-Seq data for 
adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma and healthy lung tissue.
RESULTS: The classification model improves results over using each source of 
information separately, being able to reduce the diagnosis error rate up to a 
64% over the isolate histology classifier and a 24% over the isolate gene 
expression classifier, reaching a mean F1-Score of 95.19% and a mean AUC of 
0.991.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a classification model using a late 
fusion methodology can considerably help clinicians in the diagnosis between the 
aforementioned lung cancer cancer subtypes over using each source of information 
separately. This approach can also be applied to any cancer type or disease with 
heterogeneous sources of information.

BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves complex genetic 
susceptibility that impacts pathways regulating host immunity and the target of 
autoimmune attack, insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. Interactions between 
risk variants and environmental factors result in significant heterogeneity in 
clinical presentation among those who develop T1D. Although genetic risk is 
dominated by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II and insulin (INS) gene 
loci, nearly 150 additional risk variants are significantly associated with the 
disease, including polymorphisms in immune checkpoint molecules, such as SIRPG.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this review, we summarize the literature related to the 
T1D-associated risk variants in SIRPG, which include a protein-coding variant 
(rs6043409, G>A; A263V) and an intronic polymorphism (rs2281808, C>T), and their 
potential impacts on the immunoregulatory signal regulatory protein (SIRP) 
family:CD47 signaling axis. We discuss how dysregulated expression or function 
of SIRPs and CD47 in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), T cells, natural killer 
(NK) cells, and pancreatic β-cells could potentially promote T1D development.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: We propose a hypothesis, supported by emerging genetic and 
functional immune studies, which states a loss of proper SIRP:CD47 signaling may 
result in increased lymphocyte activation and cytotoxicity and enhanced β-cell 
destruction. Thus, we present several novel therapeutic strategies for 
modulation of SIRPs and CD47 to intervene in T1D.

MAX dimerization (MXD) protein 3 (MXD3) is a member of the MXD family of 
basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine-zipper (bHLHZ) transcription factors that plays 
pivotal roles in cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. However, there 
is insufficient scientific evidence on the pathogenic roles of MXD3 in various 
cancers and whether MXD3 plays a role in the immuno-oncology context of the 
tumor microenvironment, pathogenesis, prognosis, and therapeutic response of 
different tumors through certain common molecular mechanisms; thus, we saw a 
need to conduct the present in silico pan-cancer study. Using various 
computational tools, we interrogated the role of MXD3 in tumor immune 
infiltration, immune evasion, tumor progression, therapy response, and prognosis 
of cohorts from various cancer types. Our results indicated that MXD3 was 
aberrantly expressed in almost all The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer types 
and subtypes and was associated with the tumor stage, metastasis, and worse 
prognoses of various cohorts. Our results also suggested that MXD3 is associated 
with tumor immune evasion via different mechanisms involving T-cell exclusion in 
different cancer types and by tumor infiltration of immune cells in thymoma 
(THYM), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSC). Methylation of MXD3 was inversely associated with messenger 
(m)RNA expression levels and mediated dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes and worse 
prognoses of cohorts from different cancer types. Finally, we found that genetic 
alterations and oncogenic features of MXD3 were concomitantly associated with 
deregulation of the DBN1, RAB24, SLC34A1, PRELID1, LMAN2, F12, GRK6, RGS14, 
PRR7, and PFN3 genes and were connected to phospholipid transport and ion 
homeostasis. Our results also suggested that MXD3 expression is associated with 
immune or chemotherapeutic outcomes in various cancers. In addition, higher MXD3 
expression levels were associated with decreased sensitivity of cancer cell 
lines to several mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors but 
led to increased activities of other kinase inhibitors, including Akt 
inhibitors. Interestingly, MXD3 exhibited higher predictive power for response 
outcomes and overall survival of immune checkpoint blockade sub-cohorts than 
three of seven standardized biomarkers. Altogether, our study strongly suggests 
that MXD3 is an immune-oncogenic molecule and could serve as a biomarker for 
cancer detection, prognosis, therapeutic design, and follow-up.

An individual's genetics can dramatically influence breast cancer (BC) risk. 
Although clinical measures for prevention do exist, non-invasive personalized 
measures for reducing BC risk are limited. Commonly used medications are a 
promising set of modifiable factors, but no previous study has explored whether 
a range of widely taken approved drugs modulate BC genetics. In this study, we 
describe a quantitative framework for exploring the interaction between the 
genetic susceptibility of BC and medication usage among UK Biobank women. We 
computed BC polygenic scores (PGSs) that summarize BC genetic risk and find that 
the PGS explains nearly three-times greater variation in disease risk within 
corticosteroid users compared to non-users. We map 35 genes significantly 
interacting with corticosteroid use (FDR < 0.1), highlighting the transcription 
factor NRF2 as a common regulator of gene-corticosteroid interactions in BC. 
Finally, we discover a regulatory variant strongly stratifying BC risk according 
to corticosteroid use. Within risk allele carriers, 18.2% of women taking 
corticosteroids developed BC, compared to 5.1% of the non-users (with an HR = 
3.41 per-allele within corticosteroid users). In comparison, there are no 
differences in BC risk within the reference allele homozygotes. Overall, this 
work highlights the clinical relevance of gene-drug interactions in disease risk 
and provides a roadmap for repurposing biobanks in drug repositioning and 
precision medicine.

Underlying mechanisms of multi-organ manifestations and exacerbated inflammation 
in COVID-19 are yet to be delineated. The hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 triggering 
autoimmunity is gaining attention and, in the present study, we have identified 
28 human proteins harbouring regions homologous to SARS-CoV-2 peptides that 
could possibly be acting as autoantigens in COVID-19 patients displaying 
autoimmune conditions. Interestingly, these conserved regions are amongst the 
experimentally validated B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The reported 
human proteins have demonstrated presence of autoantibodies against them in 
typical autoimmune conditions which may explain the frequent occurrence of 
autoimmune conditions following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the proposed 
autoantigens' widespread tissue distribution is suggestive of their involvement 
in multi-organ manifestations via molecular mimicry. We opine that our report 
may aid in directing subsequent necessary antigen-specific studies, results of 
which would be of long-term relevance in management of extrapulmonary symptoms 
of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain (CWP) is a 
symptom of fibromyalgia and a complex trait with poorly understood pathogenesis. 
CWP is heritable (48%-54%), but its genetic architecture is unknown and 
candidate gene studies have produced inconsistent results. We conducted a 
genome-wide association study to get insight into the genetic background of CWP.
METHODS: Northern Europeans from UK Biobank comprising 6914 cases reporting pain 
all over the body lasting >3 months and 242 929 controls were studied. 
Replication of three independent genome-wide significant single nucleotide 
polymorphisms was attempted in six independent European cohorts (n=43 080; 
cases=14 177). Genetic correlations with risk factors, tissue specificity and 
colocalisation were examined.
RESULTS: Three genome-wide significant loci were identified (rs1491985, 
rs10490825, rs165599) residing within the genes Ring Finger Protein 123 
(RNF123), ATPase secretory pathway Ca2+transporting 1 (ATP2C1) and 
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). The RNF123 locus was replicated 
(meta-analysis p=0.0002), the ATP2C1 locus showed suggestive association 
(p=0.0227) and the COMT locus was not replicated. Partial genetic correlation 
between CWP and depressive symptoms, body mass index, age of first birth and 
years of schooling were identified. Tissue specificity and colocalisation 
analysis highlight the relevance of skeletal muscle in CWP.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel association of RNF123 locus and a suggestive 
association of ATP2C1 locus with CWP. Both loci are consistent with a role of 
calcium regulation in CWP. The association with COMT, one of the most studied 
genes in chronic pain field, was not confirmed in the replication analysis.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common complex disease in women with a 
strong genetic component and downstream consequences for reproductive, metabolic 
and psychological health. There are currently 19 known PCOS risk loci, primarily 
identified in women of Han Chinese or European ancestry, and 14 of these risk 
loci were identified or replicated in a genome-wide association study of PCOS 
performed in up to 10,074 cases and 103,164 controls of European descent. 
However, for most of these loci the gene responsible for the association is 
unknown. We therefore use a Bayesian colocalization approach (Coloc) to 
highlight genes in PCOS-associated regions that may have a role in mediating the 
disease risk. We evaluated the posterior probabilities of evidence consistent 
with shared causal variants between 14 PCOS genetic risk loci and intermediate 
cellular phenotypes in one protein (N = 3301) and two expression quantitative 
trait locus datasets (N = 31,684 and N = 80-491). Through these analyses, we 
identified seven proteins or genes with evidence of a possibly shared causal 
variant for almost 30% of known PCOS signals, including follicle stimulating 
hormone and ERBB3, IKZF4, RPS26, SUOX, ZFP36L2, and C8orf49. Several of these 
potential effector proteins and genes have been implicated in the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal signalling pathway and provide an avenue for 
functional follow-up in order to demonstrate a causal role in PCOS 
pathophysiology.

Cellular immunotherapy has recently emerged as a fourth pillar in cancer 
treatment co-joining surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Where, the 
discovery of immune checkpoint blockage or inhibition (ICB/ICI), anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
and anti-CTLA4-based, therapy has revolutionized the class of cancer treatment 
at a different level. However, some cancer patients escape this immune 
surveillance mechanism and become resistant to ICB-therapy. Therefore, a more 
advanced or an alternative treatment is required urgently. Despite the 
functional importance of epitranscriptomics in diverse clinico-biological 
practices, its role in improving the efficacy of ICB therapeutics has been 
limited. Consequently, our study encapsulates the evidence, as a possible 
strategy, to improve the efficacy of ICB-therapy by co-targeting molecular 
checkpoints especially N6A-modification machineries which can be reformed into 
RNA modifying drugs (RMD). Here, we have explained the mechanism of individual 
RNA-modifiers (editor/writer, eraser/remover, and effector/reader) in overcoming 
the issues associated with high-dose antibody toxicities and drug-resistance. 
Moreover, we have shed light on the importance of suppressor of cytokine 
signaling (SOCS/CISH) and microRNAs in improving the efficacy of ICB-therapy, 
with brief insight on the current monoclonal antibodies undergoing clinical 
trials or already approved against several solid tumor and metastatic cancers. 
We anticipate our investigation will encourage researchers and clinicians to 
further strengthen the efficacy of ICB-therapeutics by considering the 
importance of epitranscriptomics as a personalized medicine.

Eukaryotic genomes are highly organised within the nucleus of a cell, allowing 
widely dispersed regulatory elements such as enhancers to interact with gene 
promoters through physical contacts in three-dimensional space. Recent 
chromosome conformation capture methodologies such as Hi-C have enabled the 
analysis of interacting regions of the genome providing a valuable insight into 
the three-dimensional organisation of the chromatin in the nucleus, including 
chromosome compartmentalisation and gene expression. Complicating the analysis 
of Hi-C data, however, is the massive amount of identified interactions, many of 
which do not directly drive gene function, thus hindering the identification of 
potentially biologically functional 3D interactions. In this review, we collate 
and examine the downstream analysis of Hi-C data with particular focus on 
methods that prioritise potentially functional interactions. We classify three 
groups of approaches: structural-based discovery methods, e.g. A/B compartments 
and topologically associated domains, detection of statistically significant 
chromatin interactions, and the use of epigenomic data integration to narrow 
down useful interaction information. Careful use of these three approaches is 
crucial to successfully identifying potentially functional interactions within 
the genome.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC or KIRC) has a high mortality rate 
globally. It is necessary to identify biomarkers and investigate the mechanisms 
those biomarkers are associated with, to improve the prognosis of patients with 
KIRC. N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) affects the fate of modified RNA molecules and is 
involved in tumor progression. Different webservers were used in our research to 
investigate the mRNA transcription and clinical significance of YTHDF2 in KIRC. 
Survival analysis revealed that patients with elevated YTHDF2 transcription had 
a slightly longer OS and DFS than those with low YTHDF2 expression. YTHDF2 
expression was shown to be significantly associated with the abundance of immune 
cells such as B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and 
dendritic cells. For a series of enrichment studies, we combined information on 
YTHDF2-binding molecules and expression-linked genes and identified the possible 
influence of "mRNA surveillance pathway," "RNA degradation," and "RNA transport" 
in the biology or pathogeny of KIRC. In addition, we identified multiple miRNA, 
kinase, and transcription factor targets of YTHDF2 in KIRC and constructed 
target networks. Overall, our findings show that YTHDF2 is a possible indicator 
of immune infiltration in the KIRC.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), one of the leading inherited causes of child 
mortality, is a rare neuromuscular disease arising from loss-of-function 
mutations of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which encodes the SMN 
protein. When lacking the SMN protein in neurons, patients suffer from muscle 
weakness and atrophy, and in the severe cases, respiratory failure and death. 
Several therapeutic approaches show promise with human testing and three 
medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
date. Despite the shown promise of these approved therapies, there are some 
crucial limitations, one of the most important being the cost. The FDA-approved 
drugs are high-priced and are shortlisted among the most expensive treatments in 
the world. The price is still far beyond affordable and may serve as a burden 
for patients. The blooming of the biomedical data and advancement of 
computational approaches have opened new possibilities for SMA therapeutic 
development. This article highlights the present status of computationally aided 
approaches, including in silico drug repurposing, network driven drug discovery 
as well as artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted drug discovery, and discusses 
the future prospects.

BACKGROUND: Reproducible benchmarking is important for assessing the 
effectiveness of novel feature selection approaches applied on gene expression 
data, especially for prior knowledge approaches that incorporate biological 
information from online knowledge bases. However, no full-fledged benchmarking 
system exists that is extensible, provides built-in feature selection 
approaches, and a comprehensive result assessment encompassing classification 
performance, robustness, and biological relevance. Moreover, the particular 
needs of prior knowledge feature selection approaches, i.e. uniform access to 
knowledge bases, are not addressed. As a consequence, prior knowledge approaches 
are not evaluated amongst each other, leaving open questions regarding their 
effectiveness.
RESULTS: We present the Comprior benchmark tool, which facilitates the rapid 
development and effortless benchmarking of feature selection approaches, with a 
special focus on prior knowledge approaches. Comprior is extensible by custom 
approaches, offers built-in standard feature selection approaches, enables 
uniform access to multiple knowledge bases, and provides a customizable 
evaluation infrastructure to compare multiple feature selection approaches 
regarding their classification performance, robustness, runtime, and biological 
relevance.
CONCLUSION: Comprior allows reproducible benchmarking especially of prior 
knowledge approaches, which facilitates their applicability and for the first 
time enables a comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness.

Inactivating mutations in the Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene are the 
main cause of Rett syndrome (RTT). Despite extensive research into MECP2 
function, no treatments for RTT are currently available. Here, we used an 
evolutionary genomics approach to construct an unbiased MECP2 gene network, 
using 1028 eukaryotic genomes to prioritize proteins with strong co-evolutionary 
signatures with MECP2. Focusing on proteins targeted by FDA-approved drugs led 
to three promising targets, two of which were previously linked to MECP2 
function (IRAK, KEAP1) and one that was not (EPOR). The drugs targeting these 
three proteins (Pacritinib, DMF, and EPO) were able to rescue different 
phenotypes of MECP2 inactivation in cultured human neural cell types, and 
appeared to converge on Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in 
inflammation. This study highlights the potential of comparative genomics to 
accelerate drug discovery, and yields potential new avenues for the treatment of 
RTT.

Drug designing and development is an important area of research for 
pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, low efficacy, 
off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and 
challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data 
from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an 
obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine 
learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In 
other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have 
modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been 
implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, 
structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity 
prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative 
structure-activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and 
physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation 
of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data 
mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to 
recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and 
deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug 
design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. The primary 
concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and 
production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and 
inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery 
and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design 
integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and 
hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is 
referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning 
comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement 
learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been 
extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural 
network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and 
regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and 
meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and 
discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas 
of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to 
molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative 
structure-activity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to 
protein-protein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to 
polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the 
classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and 
clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker 
development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and 
physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of 
action.

The generation of new ideas and scientific hypotheses is often the result of 
extensive literature and database searches, but, with the growing wealth of 
public and private knowledge, the process of searching diverse and 
interconnected data to generate new insights into genes, gene networks, traits 
and diseases is becoming both more complex and more time-consuming. To guide 
this technically challenging data integration task and to make gene discovery 
and hypotheses generation easier for researchers, we have developed a 
comprehensive software package called KnetMiner which is open-source and 
containerized for easy use. KnetMiner is an integrated, intelligent, interactive 
gene and gene network discovery platform that supports scientists explore and 
understand the biological stories of complex traits and diseases across species. 
It features fast algorithms for generating rich interactive gene networks and 
prioritizing candidate genes based on knowledge mining approaches. KnetMiner is 
used in many plant science institutions and has been adopted by several plant 
breeding organizations to accelerate gene discovery. The software is generic and 
customizable and can therefore be readily applied to new species and data types; 
for example, it has been applied to pest insects and fungal pathogens; and most 
recently repurposed to support COVID-19 research. Here, we give an overview of 
the main approaches behind KnetMiner and we report plant-centric case studies 
for identifying genes, gene networks and trait relationships in Triticum 
aestivum (bread wheat), as well as, an evidence-based approach to rank candidate 
genes under a large Arabidopsis thaliana QTL. KnetMiner is available at:

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most common asthma controller medication. 
An important contribution of genetic factors in ICS response has been evidenced. 
Here, we aimed to identify novel genetic markers involved in ICS response in 
asthma. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the change in lung function 
after 6 weeks of ICS treatment was performed in 166 asthma patients from the 
SLOVENIA study. Patients with an improvement in lung function ≥8% were 
considered as ICS responders. Suggestively associated variants (p-value ≤ 5 × 
10-6) were evaluated in an independent study (n = 175). Validation of the 
association with asthma exacerbations despite ICS use was attempted in European 
(n = 2681) and admixed (n = 1347) populations. Variants previously associated 
with ICS response were also assessed for replication. As a result, the SNP 
rs1166980 from the ROBO2 gene was suggestively associated with the change in 
lung function (OR for G allele: 7.01, 95% CI: 3.29-14.93, p = 4.61 × 10-7), 
although this was not validated in CAMP. ROBO2 showed gene-level evidence of 
replication with asthma exacerbations despite ICS use in Europeans (minimum 
p-value = 1.44 × 10-5), but not in admixed individuals. The association of 
PDE10A-T with ICS response described by a previous study was validated. This 
study suggests that ROBO2 could be a potential novel locus for ICS response in 
Europeans.

Accurate and individualized prediction of response to therapies is central to 
precision medicine. However, because of the generally complex and multifaceted 
nature of clinical drug response, realizing this vision is highly challenging, 
requiring integrating different data types from the same individual into one 
prediction model. We used the anti-epileptic drug brivaracetam as a case study 
and combine a hybrid data/knowledge-driven feature extraction with machine 
learning to systematically integrate clinical and genetic data from a clinical 
discovery dataset (n = 235 patients). We constructed a model that successfully 
predicts clinical drug response [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.76] and show 
that even with limited sample size, integrating high-dimensional genetics data 
with clinical data can inform drug response prediction. After further validation 
on data collected from an independently conducted clinical study (AUC = 0.75), 
we extensively explore our model to gain insights into the determinants of drug 
response, and identify various clinical and genetic characteristics predisposing 
to poor response. Finally, we assess the potential impact of our model on 
clinical trial design and demonstrate that, by enriching for probable 
responders, significant reductions in clinical study sizes may be achieved. To 
our knowledge, our model represents the first retrospectively validated machine 
learning model linking drug mechanism of action and the genetic, clinical and 
demographic background in epilepsy patients to clinical drug response. Hence, it 
provides a blueprint for how machine learning-based multimodal data integration 
can act as a driver in achieving the goals of precision medicine in fields such 
as neurology.

BACKGROUND: Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the most prevalent renal 
malignancy. The therapeutic strategies for advanced KIRC are very few, with only 
sunitinib being widely approved. Mutations in the PIK3CA gene can affect tumor 
cell proliferation, metastasis, and patients' survival.
METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis was performed to explore the expression and 
clinical significance of PIK3CA in KIRC. Moreover, qRT-PCR was conducted to 
verify the result.
RESULTS: Subgroup analyses of KIRC tissue based on gender, tumor grade, and 
cancer stage indicated downregulation of PIK3CA mRNA expression. The KIRC 
patients with high PIK3CA expression indicated a better overall survival, 
progression-free survival, and disease-free survival. A predictive nomogram was 
constructed and demonstrated that the calibration plots for the 3-year and 
5-year OS rates were predicted relatively well compared with an ideal model in 
the TCGA KIRC cohort. The validation study revealed that downregulation of 
PIK3CA in KIRC tissues and low PIK3CA expression had a poor overall survival 
with an AUC of 0.775 in the ROC curve. Moreover, Cox regression analysis 
revealed that PIK3CA expression and clinical stage were independent factors 
affecting the prognosis of KIRC patients. PIK3CA expression was found to be 
significantly associated with the abundance of immune cells and immune biomarker 
sets. PIK3CA and associated genes were found to be mainly associated with immune 
response and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: We identified PIK3CA as a potential biomarker for prognosis 
correlated with immune infiltrates in KIRC. Further studies should focus on the 
functions of PIK3CA in KIRC carcinogenesis.

Family and population studies indicate clear heritability of major depressive 
disorder (MDD), though its underlying biology remains unclear. The majority of 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage blocks associated with MDD by 
genome-wide association studies (GWASes) are believed to alter transcriptional 
regulators (e.g., enhancers, promoters) based on enrichment of marks correlated 
with these functions. A key to understanding MDD pathophysiology will be 
elucidation of which SNPs are functional and how such functional variants 
biologically converge to elicit the disease. Furthermore, retinoids can elicit 
MDD in patients and promote depressive-like behaviors in rodent models, acting 
via a regulatory system of retinoid receptor transcription factors (TFs). We 
therefore sought to simultaneously identify functional genetic variants and 
assess retinoid pathway regulation of MDD risk loci. Using Massively Parallel 
Reporter Assays (MPRAs), we functionally screened over 1000 SNPs prioritized 
from 39 neuropsychiatric trait/disease GWAS loci, selecting SNPs based on 
overlap with predicted regulatory features-including expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTL) and histone marks-from human brains and cell cultures. We 
identified >100 SNPs with allelic effects on expression in a retinoid-responsive 
model system. Functional SNPs were enriched for binding sequences of retinoic 
acid-receptive transcription factors (TFs), with additional allelic differences 
unmasked by treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Finally, motifs 
overrepresented across functional SNPs corresponded to TFs highly specific to 
serotonergic neurons, suggesting an in vivo site of action. Our application of 
MPRAs to screen MDD-associated SNPs suggests a shared transcriptional-regulatory 
program across loci, a component of which is unmasked by retinoids.

High-throughput technologies make it possible to produce a large amount of data 
representing different biological layers, examples of which are genomics, 
proteomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics. Omics data have been individually 
investigated to understand the molecular bases of various diseases, but this may 
not be sufficient to fully capture the molecular mechanisms and the multilayer 
regulatory processes underlying complex diseases, especially cancer. To overcome 
this problem, several multi-omics integration methods have been introduced but a 
commonly agreed standard of analysis is still lacking. In this paper, we present 
MOUSSE, a novel normalization-free pipeline for unsupervised multi-omics 
integration. The main innovations are the use of rank-based subject-specific 
signatures and the use of such signatures to derive subject similarity networks. 
A separate similarity network was derived for each omics, and the resulting 
networks were then carefully merged in a way that considered their informative 
content. We applied it to analyze survival in ten different types of cancer. We 
produced a meaningful clusterization of the subjects and obtained a higher 
average classification score than ten state-of-the-art algorithms tested on the 
same data. As further validation, we extracted from the subject-specific 
signatures a list of relevant features used for the clusterization and 
investigated their biological role in survival. We were able to verify that, 
according to the literature, these features are highly involved in cancer 
progression and differential survival.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most prevalent kidney cancer 
worldwide, and appropriate cancer biomarkers facilitate early diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognosis prediction in cancer management. However, an accurate 
biomarker for ccRCC is lacking. This study identified 356 differentially 
expressed genes in ccRCC tissues compared with normal kidney tissues by 
integrative analysis of eight ccRCC datasets. Enrichment analysis of the 
differentially expressed genes unveiled improved adaptation to hypoxia and 
metabolic reprogramming of the tumor cells. Aldehyde oxidase 1 (AOX1) gene was 
identified as a biomarker for ccRCC among all the differentially expressed 
genes. ccRCC tissues expressed significantly lower AOX1 than normal kidney 
tissues, which was further validated by immunohistochemistry at the protein 
level and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data mining at the mRNA level. Higher 
AOX1 expression predicted better overall survival in ccRCC patients. 
Furthermore, AOX1 DNA copy number deletion and hypermethylation were negatively 
correlated with AOX1 expression, which might be the potential mechanism for its 
dysregulation in ccRCC. Finally, we illustrated that the effect of AOX1 as a 
tumor suppressor gene is not restricted to ccRCC but universally exists in many 
other cancer types. Hence, AOX1 may act as a potential prognostic biomarker and 
therapeutic target for ccRCC.

GM-CSF produced by autoreactive CD4-positive T helper cells is involved in the 
pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. However, the 
molecular regulators that establish and maintain the features of GM-CSF-positive 
CD4 T cells are unknown. In order to identify these regulators, we isolated 
human GM-CSF-producing CD4 T cells from human peripheral blood by using a 
cytokine capture assay. We compared these cells to the corresponding 
GM-CSF-negative fraction, and furthermore, we studied naïve CD4 T cells, memory 
CD4 T cells, and bulk CD4 T cells from the same individuals as additional 
control cell populations. As a result, we provide a rich resource of integrated 
chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from these 
primary human CD4 T cell subsets and we show that the identified signatures are 
associated with human autoimmune diseases, especially multiple sclerosis. By 
combining information about mRNA expression, DNA accessibility, and predicted 
transcription factor binding, we reconstructed directed gene regulatory networks 
connecting transcription factors to their targets, which comprise putative key 
regulators of human GM-CSF-positive CD4 T cells as well as memory CD4 T cells. 
Our results suggest potential therapeutic targets to be investigated in the 
future in human autoimmune disease.

Achilles' heel relationships arise when the status of one gene exposes a cell's 
vulnerability to perturbation of a second gene, such as chemical inhibition, 
providing therapeutic opportunities for precision oncology. SynLeGG 
(www.overton-lab.uk/synlegg) identifies and visualizes mutually exclusive loss 
signatures in 'omics data to enable discovery of genetic dependency 
relationships (GDRs) across 783 cancer cell lines and 30 tissues. While there is 
significant focus on genetic approaches, transcriptome data has advantages for 
investigation of GDRs and remains relatively underexplored. SynLeGG depends upon 
the MultiSEp algorithm for unsupervised assignment of cell lines into gene 
expression clusters, which provide the basis for analysis of CRISPR scores and 
mutational status in order to propose candidate GDRs. Benchmarking against 
SynLethDB demonstrates favourable performance for MultiSEp against competing 
approaches, finding significantly higher area under the Receiver Operator 
Characteristic curve and between 2.8-fold to 8.5-fold greater coverage. In 
addition to pan-cancer analysis, SynLeGG offers investigation of tissue-specific 
GDRs and recovers established relationships, including synthetic lethality for 
SMARCA2 with SMARCA4. Proteomics, Gene Ontology, protein-protein interactions 
and paralogue information are provided to assist interpretation and candidate 
drug target prioritization. SynLeGG predictions are significantly enriched in 
dependencies validated by a recently published CRISPR screen.

Human genetics plays an increasingly important role in drug development and 
population health. Here we review the history of human genetics in the context 
of accelerating the discovery of therapies, present examples of how human 
genetics evidence supports successful drug targets, and discuss how polygenic 
risk scores could be beneficial in various clinical settings. We highlight the 
value of direct-to-consumer platforms in the era of fast-paced big data 
biotechnology, and how diverse genetic and health data can benefit society. ©

BACKGROUND: BCL2L13 belongs to the BCL2 super family, with its protein product 
exhibits capacity of apoptosis-mediating in diversified cell lines. Previous 
studies have shown that BCL2L13 has functional consequence in several tumor 
types, including ALL and GBM, however, its function in kidney cancer remains as 
yet unclearly.
METHODS: Multiple web-based portals were employed to analyze the effect of 
BCL2L13 in kidney cancer using the data from TCGA database. Functional 
enrichment analysis and hubs of BCL2L13 co-expressed genes in clear cell renal 
cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) were carried 
out on Cytoscape. Evaluation of BCL2L13 protein level was accomplished through 
immunohistochemistry on paraffin embedded renal cancer tissue sections. Western 
blotting and flow cytometry were implemented to further analyze the 
pro-apoptotic function of BCL2L13 in ccRCC cell line 786-0.
RESULTS: BCL2L13 expression is significantly decreased in ccRCC and pRCC 
patients, however, mutations and copy number alterations are rarely observed. 
The poor prognosis of ccRCC that derived from down-regulated BCL2L13 is 
independent of patients' gender or tumor grade. Furthermore, BCL2L13 only weakly 
correlates with the genes that mutated in kidney cancer or the genes that 
associated with inherited kidney cancer predisposing syndrome, while actively 
correlates with SLC25A4. As a downstream effector of BCL2L13 in its 
pro-apoptotic pathway, SLC25A4 is found as one of the hub genes that involved in 
the physiological function of BCL2L13 in kidney cancer tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of BCL2L13 renders poor prognosis in ccRCC and 
pRCC. This disadvantageous factor is independent of any well-known kidney cancer 
related genes, so BCL2L13 can be used as an effective indicator for prognostic 
evaluation of renal cell carcinoma.

The advent of personalised medicine promises a deeper understanding of 
mechanisms and therefore therapies. However, the connection between genomic 
sequences and clinical treatments is often unclear. We studied 50 breast cancer 
patients belonging to a population-cohort in the state of Qatar. From Sanger 
sequencing, we identified several new deleterious mutations in the estrogen 
receptor 1 gene (ESR1). The effect of these mutations on drug treatment in the 
protein target encoded by ESR1, namely the estrogen receptor, was achieved via 
rapid and accurate protein-ligand binding affinity interaction studies which 
were performed for the selected drugs and the natural ligand estrogen. Four 
nonsynonymous mutations in the ligand-binding domain were subjected to molecular 
dynamics simulation using absolute and relative binding free energy methods, 
leading to the ranking of the efficacy of six selected drugs for patients with 
the mutations. Our study shows that a personalised clinical decision system can 
be created by integrating an individual patient's genomic data at the molecular 
level within a computational pipeline which ranks the efficacy of binding of 
particular drugs to variant proteins.

Brain tumors are among the most lethal tumors. Glioblastoma, the most frequent 
primary brain tumor in adults, has a median survival time of approximately 15 
months after diagnosis or a five-year survival rate of 10%; the recurrence rate 
is nearly 90%. Unfortunately, this prognosis has not improved for several 
decades. The lack of progress in the treatment of brain tumors has been 
attributed to their high rate of primary therapy resistance. Challenges such as 
pronounced inter-patient variability, intratumoral heterogeneity, and drug 
delivery across the blood-brain barrier hinder progress. A comprehensive, 
multiscale understanding of the disease, from the molecular to the whole tumor 
level, is needed to address the intratumor heterogeneity resulting from the 
coexistence of a diversity of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cell types in the 
tumor tissue. By contrast, inter-patient variability must be addressed by 
subtyping brain tumors to stratify patients and identify the best-matched 
drug(s) and therapies for a particular patient or cohort of patients. 
Accomplishing these diverse tasks will require a new framework, one involving a 
systems perspective in assessing the immense complexity of brain tumors. This 
would in turn entail a shift in how clinical medicine interfaces with the 
rapidly advancing high-throughput (HTP) technologies that have enabled the 
omics-scale profiling of molecular features of brain tumors from the single-cell 
to the tissue level. However, several gaps must be closed before such a 
framework can fulfill the promise of precision and personalized medicine for 
brain tumors. Ultimately, the goal is to integrate seamlessly multiscale systems 
analyses of patient tumors and clinical medicine. Accomplishing this goal would 
facilitate the rational design of therapeutic strategies matched to the 
characteristics of patients and their tumors. Here, we discuss some of the 
technologies, methodologies, and computational tools that will facilitate the 
realization of this vision to practice.

Cardiometabolic diseases are an increasing global health burden. While 
socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, and genetic risk factors have been 
identified, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is required to 
develop more effective interventions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been 
used to assess organ health, but biobank-scale studies are still in their 
infancy. Using over 38,000 abdominal MRI scans in the UK Biobank, we used deep 
learning to quantify volume, fat, and iron in seven organs and tissues, and 
demonstrate that imaging-derived phenotypes reflect health status. We show that 
these traits have a substantial heritable component (8-44%) and identify 93 
independent genome-wide significant associations, including four associations 
with liver traits that have not previously been reported. Our work demonstrates 
the tractability of deep learning to systematically quantify health parameters 
from high-throughput MRI across a range of organs and tissues, and use the 
largest-ever study of its kind to generate new insights into the genetic 
architecture of these traits.

MOTIVATION: The wealth of data resources on human phenotypes, risk factors, 
molecular traits and therapeutic interventions presents new opportunities for 
population health sciences. These opportunities are paralleled by a growing need 
for data integration, curation and mining to increase research efficiency, 
reduce mis-inference and ensure reproducible research.
RESULTS: We developed EpiGraphDB (https://epigraphdb.org/), a graph database 
containing an array of different biomedical and epidemiological relationships 
and an analytical platform to support their use in human population health data 
science. In addition, we present three case studies that illustrate the value of 
this platform. The first uses EpiGraphDB to evaluate potential pleiotropic 
relationships, addressing mis-inference in systematic causal analysis. In the 
second case study, we illustrate how protein-protein interaction data offer 
opportunities to identify new drug targets. The final case study integrates 
causal inference using Mendelian randomization with relationships mined from the 
biomedical literature to 'triangulate' evidence from different sources.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The EpiGraphDB platform is openly available at 
https://epigraphdb.org. Code for replicating case study results is available at 
https://github.com/MRCIEU/epigraphdb as Jupyter notebooks using the API, and 
https://mrcieu.github.io/epigraphdb-r using the R package.

To identify candidate causal genes of asthma, we performed a genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) in UK Biobank on a broad asthma definition (n = 56,167 
asthma cases and 352,255 controls). We then carried out functional mapping 
through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and Mendelian 
randomization in lung (n = 1,038) and blood (n = 31,684) tissues. The GWAS 
reveals 72 asthma-associated loci from 116 independent significant variants 
(PGWAS < 5.0E-8). The most significant lung TWAS gene on 17q12-q21 is GSDMB 
(PTWAS = 1.42E-54). Other TWAS genes include TSLP on 5q22, RERE on 1p36, CLEC16A 
on 16p13, and IL4R on 16p12, which all replicated in GTEx lung (n = 515). We 
demonstrate that the largest fold enrichment of regulatory and functional 
annotations among asthma-associated variants is in the blood. We map 485 blood 
eQTL-regulated genes associated with asthma and 50 of them are causal by 
Mendelian randomization. Prioritization of druggable genes reveals known (IL4R, 
TSLP, IL6, TNFSF4) and potentially new therapeutic targets for asthma.

High blood pressure is the heritable risk factor for cardiovascular and kidney 
diseases. Genome-wide association studies(GWAS) on blood pressure traits 
increase our understanding of its underlying genetic basis. However, a large 
proportion of GWAS was conducted in Europeans, and some roadblocks deprive other 
populations to benefit from their results. Iranians population with a high 
degree of genomic specificity has not been represented in international 
databases to date, so to fill the gap, we explored the effects of 652,919 
genomic variants on Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood 
Pressure (DBP), and Hypertension (HTN) in 7694 Iranian adults aged 18 and over 
from Tehran Cardiometabolic Genetic Study (TCGS). We identified consistent 
signals on ZBED9 associated with HTN in the genome-wide borderline threshold 
after adjusting for different sets of environmental predictors. Moreover, strong 
signals on ABHD17C and suggestive signals on FBN1 were detected for DBP and SBP, 
respectively, while these signals were not consistent in different GWA analysis. 
Our finding on ZBED9 was confirmed for all BP traits by linkage analysis in an 
independent sample. We found significant associations with similar direction of 
effects and allele frequency of genetic variants on ZBED9 with DBP (genome-wide 
threshold) and HTN (nominal threshold) in GWAS summary data of UK Biobank. 
Although there is no strong evidence to support the function of ZBED9 in blood 
pressure regulation, it provides new insight into the pleiotropic effects of 
hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to study the role of thymidylate 
synthetase (TYMS) and B-cell lymphoma-2 like 1 (BCL2L1) in the occurrence and 
development of colorectal cancer and its potential regulatory mechanism.
METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were 
analyzed to examine the expression and prognostic value of TYMS and BCL2L1 in 
colorectal cancer. C-BioPortal analysis was used to detect the TYMS and BCL2L1 
alterations. Through The Human Protein Atlas (THPA), the TYMS and BCL2L1 protein 
levels were also assessed. The protein protein interaction (PPI) network was 
built using GeneMANIA analysis, while co-expression genes correlated with TYMS 
and BCL2L1 were identified using LinkedOmics analysis. Finally, we collected 
clinical samples to verify the expressions of TYMS and BCL2L1 in colorectal 
cancer.
RESULTS: TYMS and BCL2L1 were up-regulated, and TYMS and BCL2L1 genomic 
alterations were not associated with the occurrence of colorectal cancer. TYMS 
and BCL2L1 were significantly connected with the prognosis of colorectal cancer 
patients. The genes interacted with TYMS and BCL2L1 were linked to functional 
networks involving pathway of apoptosis, apoptosis-multiple species, colorectal 
cancer, platinum drug resistance and p53 signaling pathway. qRT-PCR verification 
results of TYMS were consistent with the result of TCGA and GEO analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study display that data mining can efficiently provide 
information on expression of TYMS and BCL2L1, correlated genes of TYMS and 
BCL2L1, core pathways and potential functional networks in colorectal cancer, 
suggesting that TYMS and BCL2L1 may become new prognostic and therapeutic 
targets for colorectal cancer.

Depression is a common condition, but current treatments are only effective in a 
subset of individuals. To identify new treatment targets, we integrated 
depression genome-wide association study (GWAS) results (N = 500,199) with human 
brain proteomes (N = 376) to perform a proteome-wide association study of 
depression followed by Mendelian randomization. We identified 19 genes that were 
consistent with being causal in depression, acting via their respective 
cis-regulated brain protein abundance. We replicated nine of these genes using 
an independent depression GWAS (N = 307,353) and another human brain proteomic 
dataset (N = 152). Eleven of the 19 genes also had cis-regulated mRNA levels 
that were associated with depression, based on integration of the depression 
GWAS with human brain transcriptomes (N = 888). Meta-analysis of the discovery 
and replication proteome-wide association study analyses identified 25 brain 
proteins consistent with being causal in depression, 20 of which were not 
previously implicated in depression by GWAS. Together, these findings provide 
promising brain protein targets for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies.

The advent of large-scale, phenotypically rich, and readily accessible data 
provides an unprecedented opportunity for epidemiologists, statistical 
geneticists, bioinformaticians, and also behavioral and social scientists to 
investigate the causes and consequences of disease. Computational tools and 
resources are an integral component of such endeavors, which will become 
increasingly important as these data continue to grow exponentially. In this 
review, we have provided an overview of computational software and databases 
that have been developed to assist with analyses in causal inference. This 
includes online tools that can be used to help generate hypotheses, publicly 
accessible resources that store summary-level information for millions of 
genetic markers, and computational approaches that can be used to leverage this 
wealth of data to study causal relationships.

Extracellular ATP functions as a signaling messenger through its actions on 
purinergic receptors, and is known to be involved in numerous physiological and 
pathophysiological processes throughout the body, including in the lungs and 
airways. Consequently, purinergic receptors are considered to be promising 
therapeutic targets for many respiratory diseases, including asthma. This review 
explores how online bioinformatics resources combined with recently generated 
datasets can be utilized to investigate purinergic receptor gene expression in 
tissues and cell types of interest in respiratory disease to identify potential 
therapeutic targets, which can then be investigated further. These approaches 
show that different purinergic receptors are expressed at different levels in 
lung tissue, and that purinergic receptors tend to be expressed at higher levels 
in immune cells and at more moderate levels in airway structural cells. Notably, 
P2RX1, P2RX4, P2RX7, P2RY1, P2RY11, and P2RY14 were revealed as the most highly 
expressed purinergic receptors in lung tissue, therefore suggesting that these 
receptors have good potential as therapeutic targets for asthma and other 
respiratory diseases.

Marine farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are susceptible to recurrent amoebic 
gill disease (AGD) caused by the ectoparasite Neoparamoeba perurans over the 
growout production cycle. The parasite elicits a highly localized response 
within the gill epithelium resulting in multifocal mucoid patches at the site of 
parasite attachment. This host-parasite response drives a complex immune 
reaction, which remains poorly understood. To generate a model for host-parasite 
interaction during pathogenesis of AGD in Atlantic salmon the local (gill) and 
systemic transcriptomic response in the host, and the parasite during AGD 
pathogenesis was explored. A dual RNA-seq approach together with differential 
gene expression and system-wide statistical analyses of gene and transcription 
factor networks was employed. A multi-tissue transcriptomic data set was 
generated from the gill (including both lesioned and non-lesioned tissue), head 
kidney and spleen tissues naïve and AGD-affected Atlantic salmon sourced from an 
in vivo AGD challenge trial. Differential gene expression of the salmon host 
indicates local and systemic upregulation of defense and immune responses. Two 
transcription factors, znfOZF-like and znf70-like, and their associated gene 
networks significantly altered with disease state. The majority of genes in 
these networks are candidates for mediators of the immune response, cellular 
proliferation and invasion. These include Aurora kinase B-like, rho guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor 25-like and protein NDNF-like inhibited. Analysis of 
the N. perurans transcriptome during AGD pathology compared to in vitro cultured 
N. perurans trophozoites, as a proxy for wild type trophozoites, identified 
multiple gene candidates for virulence and indicates a potential master 
regulatory gene system analogous to the two-component PhoP/Q system. Candidate 
genes identified are associated with invasion of host tissue, evasion of host 
defense mechanisms and formation of the mucoid lesion. We generated a novel 
model for host-parasite interaction during AGD pathogenesis through integration 
of host and parasite functional profiles. Collectively, this dual transcriptomic 
study provides novel molecular insights into the pathology of AGD and provides 
alternative theories for future research in a step towards improved management 
of AGD.

Crohn's disease (CD), a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is 
characterized by heterogeneity along multiple clinical axes, which in turn 
impacts disease progression and treatment modalities. Using advanced data 
integration approaches and systems biology tools, we studied the contribution of 
CD susceptibility variants and gene expression in distinct peripheral immune 
cell subsets (CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells) to relevant clinical traits. Our 
analyses revealed that most clinical traits capturing CD heterogeneity could be 
associated with CD14+ and CD4+ gene expression rather than disease 
susceptibility variants. By disentangling the sources of variation, we 
identified molecular features that could potentially be driving the 
heterogeneity of various clinical traits of CD patients. Further downstream 
analyses identified contextual hub proteins such as genes encoding barrier 
functions, antimicrobial peptides, chemokines, and their receptors, which are 
either targeted by drugs used in CD or other inflammatory diseases or are 
relevant to the biological functions implicated in disease pathology. These hubs 
could be used as cell type-specific targets to treat specific subtypes of CD 
patients in a more individualized approach based on the underlying biology 
driving their disease subtypes. Our study highlights the importance of data 
integration and systems approaches to investigate complex and heterogeneous 
diseases such as IBD.

Eczema is a complex chronic inflammatory skin disease impacted by environmental 
factors, infections, immune disorders, and deficiencies in skin barrier 
function. Shi Zhen Tea (SZT), derived from traditional Chinese medicine 
Xiao-Feng-San, has shown to be an effective integrative therapy for treating 
skin lesions, itching, and sleeping loss, and it facilitates reduction of 
topical steroid and antihistamine use in pediatric and adult patients with 
severe eczema. Yet, its active compounds and therapeutic mechanisms have not 
been elucidated. In this study, we sought to investigate the active compounds 
and molecular mechanisms of SZT in treating eczema using systems pharmacology 
and in silico docking analysis. SZT is composed of 4 medicinal herbs, Baizhu 
(Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizome), Jingjie (Schizonepetae herba), Kushen 
(Sophorae flavescentis radix), and Niubangzi (Arctii fructus). We first 
identified 51 active compounds from SZT and their 81 potential molecular targets 
by high-throughput computational analysis, from which we identified 4 major 
pathways including Th17 cell differentiation, metabolic pathways, pathways in 
cancer, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Through network analysis of the 
compound-target pathway, we identified hub molecular targets within these 
pathways including carbonic anhydrase II (CA2), peroxisome proliferator 
activated receptor γ (PPAR γ), retinoid X receptor α (RXRA), and vitamin D 
receptor (VDR). We further identified top 5 compounds including cynarine, 
stigmasterin, kushenol, β-sitosterol, and (24S)-24-propylcholesta-5-ene-3β-ol as 
putative key active compounds on the basis of their molecular docking scores 
with identified hub target proteins. Our study provides an insight into the 
therapeutic mechanism underlying multiscale benefits of SZT for eczema and paves 
the way for developing new and potentially more effective eczema therapies.

RATIONALE: Substantial variability in response to asthma treatment with inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) has been described among individuals and populations, 
suggesting the contribution of genetic factors. Nonetheless, only a few genes 
have been identified to date. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated 
with asthma exacerbations despite ICS use in European children and young adults 
and to validate the findings in non-Europeans. Moreover, we explored whether a 
gene-set enrichment analysis could suggest potential novel asthma therapies.
METHODS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of asthma exacerbations was 
tested in 2681 children of European descent treated with ICS from eight studies. 
Suggestive association signals were followed up for replication in 538 European 
asthma patients. Further evaluation was performed in 1773 non-Europeans. 
Variants revealed by published GWAS were assessed for replication. Additionally, 
gene-set enrichment analysis focused on drugs was performed.
RESULTS: 10 independent variants were associated with asthma exacerbations 
despite ICS treatment in the discovery phase (p≤5×10-6). Of those, one variant 
at the CACNA2D3-WNT5A locus was nominally replicated in Europeans (rs67026078; 
p=0.010), but this was not validated in non-European populations. Five other 
genes associated with ICS response in previous studies were replicated. 
Additionally, an enrichment of associations in genes regulated by trichostatin A 
treatment was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The intergenic region of CACNA2D3 and WNT5A was revealed as a novel 
locus for asthma exacerbations despite ICS treatment in European populations. 
Genes associated were related to trichostatin A, suggesting that this drug could 
regulate the molecular mechanisms involved in treatment response.

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables non-invasive imaging of the retina 
and is used to diagnose and manage ophthalmic diseases including glaucoma. We 
present the first large-scale genome-wide association study of inner retinal 
morphology using phenotypes derived from OCT images of 31,434 UK Biobank 
participants. We identify 46 loci associated with thickness of the retinal nerve 
fibre layer or ganglion cell inner plexiform layer. Only one of these loci has 
been associated with glaucoma, and despite its clear role as a biomarker for the 
disease, Mendelian randomisation does not support inner retinal thickness being 
on the same genetic causal pathway as glaucoma. We extracted overall retinal 
thickness at the fovea, representative of foveal hypoplasia, with which three of 
the 46 SNPs were associated. We additionally associate these three loci with 
visual acuity. In contrast to the Mendelian causes of severe foveal hypoplasia, 
our results suggest a spectrum of foveal hypoplasia, in part genetically 
determined, with consequences on visual function.

Khat (Catha edulis (Vahl) Endl.) is an evergreen flowering shrub used as a 
stimulant in many regions worldwide including East Africa, the Arabian 
Peninsula, Europe, and the United States. Chewing leaves of khat induces 
excitement and euphoria, which are primarily attributed to two major 
constituents, cathinone and cathine. Khat also contains other important 
constituents such as cathedulins. A considerable number of studies reported side 
effects induced by the khat extracts to both embryos and adults. These include 
teratogenicity and developmental retardation, oral cancer and ulcers, high blood 
pressure, and myocardial infarction. So far, little attention has been paid to 
the effects of khat extracts on the molecular signaling interactions. We aimed 
in this study to investigate this through evaluating the effects of khat 
extracts on SKOV3, a human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line. We show, by in 
vitro assays, that khat induces several cellular defects including reduced cell 
size, cell membrane damage, and apoptosis. At high khat extract concentrations, 
the cell metabolic activity, cell cycle, and cellular proliferation were 
affected. RT-qPCR analysis showed an increase in the gene expression of the 
apoptotic marker BAX, the tumor suppressor p53, and the inflammatory cytokine 
IL-6. Protein expression analysis by immunostaining showed downregulation of 
β-catenin, E-cadherin, and Ki-67 and upregulation of FZD8 and SPRY2, suggesting 
that Wnt and FGF signaling were implicated. SwissTargetPrediction in silico 
analysis showed that khat constituents cathine, cathinone, catheduline K2, and 
catheduline E5 bind to family A G-protein-coupled receptor, cause many 
neurological diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, 
depression, and anxiety, and induce many ovarian cancer-related diseases. The 
analysis also showed that important signaling pathways such as CREB, Wnt, FGF, 
IL-6, and ERK/MAPK, and that of the endometrial cancer, and cell cycle were 
implicated. Upstream regulators of cathine and cathinone were found to 
potentially target several molecules including interleukin-8, MMP2, PLAU, and 
micro-RNAs. In conclusion, khat induces significant cellular and molecular 
changes that could potentially cause a wide range of serious diseases and 
syndromes. Such an impact could have a heavy burden on the health care system in 
the countries where khat is consumed.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer has greatly endangered and deteriorated female health 
conditions worldwide. Refinement of predictive biomarkers could enable patient 
stratification and help optimize disease management.
METHODS: RAD51 expression profile, target-disease associations, and fitness 
scores of RAD51 were analyzed in ovarian cancer using bioinformatic analysis. To 
further identify its role, gene enrichment analysis was performed, and a 
regulatory network was constructed. Survival analysis and drug sensitivity assay 
were performed to evaluate the effect of RAD51 expression on ovarian cancer 
prognosis. The predictive value of RAD51 was then confirmed in a validation 
cohort immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: Ovarian cancer expressed more RAD51 than normal ovary. RAD51 conferred 
ovarian cancer dependency and was associated with ovarian cancer. RAD51 had 
extensive target-disease associations with various diseases, including ovarian 
cancer. Genes that correlate with and interact with RAD51 were involved in DNA 
damage repair and drug responsiveness. High RAD51 expression indicated 
unfavorable survival outcomes and resistance to platinum, taxane, and PARP 
inhibitors in ovarian cancer. In the validation cohort (126 patients), high 
RAD51 expression indicated platinum resistance, and platinum-resistant patients 
expressed more RAD51. Patients with high RAD51 expression had shorter OS 
(HR = 2.968, P < 0.0001) and poorer PFS (HR = 2.838, P < 0.0001). RAD51 
expression level was negatively correlated with patients' survival length.
CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian cancer had pronounced RAD51 expression and RAD51 conferred 
ovarian cancer dependency. High RAD51 expression indicated poor survival and 
decreased drug sensitivity. RAD51 has predictive value in ovarian cancer and can 
be exploited as a predictive biomarker.

Previous research using genome-wide association studies has identified variants 
that may contribute to lifetime risk of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. 
However, whether there are common mechanisms that link neurodegenerative 
diseases is uncertain. Here, we focus on one gene, GRN, encoding progranulin, 
and the potential mechanistic interplay between genetic risk, gene expression in 
the brain and inflammation across multiple common neurodegenerative diseases. We 
utilized genome-wide association studies, expression quantitative trait locus 
mapping and Bayesian colocalization analyses to evaluate potential causal and 
mechanistic inferences. We integrate various molecular data types from public 
resources to infer disease connectivity and shared mechanisms using a 
data-driven process. Expression quantitative trait locus analyses combined with 
genome-wide association studies identified significant functional associations 
between increasing genetic risk in the GRN region and decreased expression of 
the gene in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
Additionally, colocalization analyses show a connection between blood-based 
inflammatory biomarkers relating to platelets and GRN expression in the frontal 
cortex. GRN expression mediates neuroinflammation function related to multiple 
neurodegenerative diseases. This analysis suggests shared mechanisms for 
Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

UK Biobank is a major prospective epidemiological study, including multimodal 
brain imaging, genetics and ongoing health outcomes. Previously, we published 
genome-wide associations of 3,144 brain imaging-derived phenotypes, with a 
discovery sample of 8,428 individuals. Here we present a new open resource of 
genome-wide association study summary statistics, using the 2020 data release, 
almost tripling the discovery sample size. We now include the X chromosome and 
new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes (subcortical volumes and tissue 
contrast). Previously, we found 148 replicated clusters of associations between 
genetic variants and imaging phenotypes; in this study, we found 692, including 
12 on the X chromosome. We describe some of the newly found associations, 
focusing on the X chromosome and autosomal associations involving the new 
classes of imaging-derived phenotypes. Our novel associations implicate, for 
example, pathways involved in the rare X-linked STAR (syndactyly, telecanthus 
and anogenital and renal malformations) syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and 
mitochondrial disorders.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of noncoding 
loci that are associated with human diseases and complex traits, each of which 
could reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease1. Many of the underlying 
causal variants may affect enhancers2,3, but we lack accurate maps of enhancers 
and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the 
activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes 
and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types4. Here 
we apply this ABC model to create enhancer-gene maps in 131 human cell types and 
tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 
72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique 
genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple 
phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted 
enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, 
and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting 
noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an 
enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of 
PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study 
reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and 
provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of 
common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the relationships between genes, drugs, and disease 
states is at the core of pharmacogenomics. Two leading approaches for 
identifying these relationships in medical literature are: human expert led 
manual curation efforts, and modern data mining based automated approaches. The 
former generates small amounts of high-quality data, and the latter offers large 
volumes of mixed quality data. The algorithmically extracted relationships are 
often accompanied by supporting evidence, such as, confidence scores, source 
articles, and surrounding contexts (excerpts) from the articles, that can be 
used as data quality indicators. Tools that can leverage these quality 
indicators to help the user gain access to larger and high-quality data are 
needed.
APPROACH: We introduce GeneDive, a web application for pharmacogenomics 
researchers and precision medicine practitioners that makes gene, disease, and 
drug interactions data easily accessible and usable. GeneDive is designed to 
meet three key objectives: (1) provide functionality to manage 
information-overload problem and facilitate easy assimilation of supporting 
evidence, (2) support longitudinal and exploratory research investigations, and 
(3) offer integration of user-provided interactions data without requiring data 
sharing.
RESULTS: GeneDive offers multiple search modalities, visualizations, and other 
features that guide the user efficiently to the information of their interest. 
To facilitate exploratory research, GeneDive makes the supporting evidence and 
context for each interaction readily available and allows the data quality 
threshold to be controlled by the user as per their risk tolerance level. The 
interactive search-visualization loop enables relationship discoveries between 
diseases, genes, and drugs that might not be explicitly described in literature 
but are emergent from the source medical corpus and deductive reasoning. The 
ability to utilize user's data either in combination with the GeneDive native 
datasets or in isolation promotes richer data-driven exploration and discovery. 
These functionalities along with GeneDive's applicability for precision 
medicine, bringing the knowledge contained in biomedical literature to bear on 
particular clinical situations and improving patient care, are illustrated 
through detailed use cases.
CONCLUSION: GeneDive is a comprehensive, broad-use biological interactions 
browser. The GeneDive application and information about its underlying system 
architecture are available at http://www.genedive.net. GeneDive Docker image is 
also available for download at this URL, allowing users to (1) import their own 
interaction data securely and privately; and (2) generate and test hypotheses 
across their own and other datasets.

The conceptual basis for a genetic predisposition underlying the risk for 
developing type 1 diabetes (T1D) predates modern human molecular genetics. Over 
half of the genetic risk has been attributed to the human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) class II gene region and to the insulin (INS) gene locus - both thought to 
confer direction of autoreactivity and tissue specificity. Notwithstanding, 
questions still remain regarding the functional contributions of a vast array of 
minor polygenic risk variants scattered throughout the genome that likely 
influence disease heterogeneity and clinical outcomes. Herein, we summarize the 
available literature related to the T1D-associated coding variants defined at 
the time of this review, for the genes PTPN22, IFIH1, SH2B3, CD226, TYK2, FUT2, 
SIRPG, CTLA4, CTSH and UBASH3A. Data from genotype-selected human cohorts are 
summarized, and studies from the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse are presented to 
describe the functional impact of these variants in relation to innate and 
adaptive immunity as well as to β-cell fragility, with expression profiles in 
tissues and peripheral blood highlighted. The contribution of each variant to 
progression through T1D staging, including environmental interactions, are 
discussed with consideration of how their respective protein products may serve 
as attractive targets for precision medicine-based therapeutics to prevent or 
suspend the development of T1D.

Recent epidemiological studies suggest that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen 
(APAP) is associated with increased risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a 
neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1 in 59 children in the US. Maternal and 
prenatal exposure to pesticides from food and environmental sources have also 
been implicated to affect fetal neurodevelopment. However, the underlying 
mechanisms for ASD are so far unknown, likely with complex and multifactorial 
etiology. The aim of this study was to explore the potential effects of APAP and 
pesticide exposure on development with regards to the etiology of ASD by 
highlighting common genes and biological pathways. Genes associated with APAP, 
pesticides, and ASD through human research were retrieved from molecular and 
biomedical literature databases. The interaction network of overlapping genetic 
associations was subjected to network topology analysis and functional 
annotation of the resulting clusters. These genes were over-represented in 
pathways and biological processes (FDR p < 0.05) related to apoptosis, 
metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and carbohydrate metabolism. Since 
these three biological processes are frequently implicated in ASD, our findings 
support the hypothesis that cell death processes and specific metabolic 
pathways, both of which appear to be targeted by APAP and pesticide exposure, 
may be involved in the etiology of ASD. This novel exposures-gene-disease 
database mining might inspire future work on understanding the biological 
underpinnings of various ASD risk factors.

Gastric ulceration is among the most serious humanpublic health problems. Olea 
europea L. cv. Arbequina is one of the numerous olive varieties which have 
scarcely been studied. The reported antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential 
of the olive plant make it a potential prophylactic natural product against 
gastric ulcers. Consequently, the main goal of this study is to investigate the 
gastroprotective effect of Olea europea L. cv. Arbequina leaf extract. 
LC-HRMS-based metabolic profiling of the alcoholic extract of Olea europea L. 
cv. Arbequina led to the dereplication of 18 putative compounds (1-18). In vivo 
indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer in a rat model was established and the Olea 
europea extract was tested at a dose of 300 mg kg-1 compared to cimetidine (100 
mg kg-1). The assessment of gastric mucosal lesions and histopathology of 
gastric tissue was done. It has been proved that Olea europea significantly 
decreased the ulcer index and protected the mucosa from lesions. The antioxidant 
potential of the extract was evaluated using three in vitro assays, H2O2 
scavenging, xanthine oxidase inhibitory, and superoxide radical scavenging 
activities and showed promising activities. Moreover, an in silico based study 
was performed on the putatively dereplicated compounds, which highlighted that 
3-hydroxy tyrosol (4) and oleacein (18) can target the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme 
(5-LOX) as a protective mechanism against the pathogenesis of ulceration. Upon 
experimental validation, both compounds 3-hydroxy tyrosol (HT) and oleacein (OC) 
(4 and 18, respectively) exhibited a significant in vitro 5-LOX inhibitory 
activity with IC50 values of 8.6 and 5.8 µg/mL, respectively. The present study 
suggested a possible implication of O. europea leaves as a potential candidate 
having gastroprotective, antioxidant, and 5-LOX inhibitory activity for the 
management of gastric ulcers.

Background: Breast cancer (BRCA) and prostate cancer (PRCA) are the most 
commonly diagnosed cancer types in Latin American women and men, respectively. 
Although in recent years large-scale efforts from international consortia have 
focused on improving precision oncology, a better understanding of genomic 
features of BRCA and PRCA in developing regions and racial/ethnic minority 
populations is still required. Methods: To fill in this gap, we performed 
integrated in silico analyses to elucidate oncogenic variants from BRCA and PRCA 
driver genes; to calculate their deleteriousness scores and allele frequencies 
from seven human populations worldwide, including Latinos; and to propose the 
most effective therapeutic strategies based on precision oncology. Results: We 
analyzed 339,100 variants belonging to 99 BRCA and 82 PRCA driver genes and 
identified 18,512 and 15,648 known/predicted oncogenic variants, respectively. 
Regarding known oncogenic variants, we prioritized the most frequent and 
deleterious variants of BRCA (n = 230) and PRCA (n = 167) from Latino, African, 
Ashkenazi Jewish, East Asian, South Asian, European Finnish, and European 
non-Finnish populations, to incorporate them into pharmacogenomics testing. 
Lastly, we identified which oncogenic variants may shape the response to 
anti-cancer therapies, detailing the current status of pharmacogenomics 
guidelines and clinical trials involved in BRCA and PRCA cancer driver proteins. 
Conclusion: It is imperative to unify efforts where developing countries might 
invest in obtaining databases of genomic profiles of their populations, and 
developed countries might incorporate racial/ethnic minority populations in 
future clinical trials and cancer researches with the overall objective of 
fomenting pharmacogenomics in clinical practice and public health policies.

Bristol, Bristol BS8 2BN, UK.

MOTIVATION: Gene prioritization at human GWAS loci is challenging due to 
linkage-disequilibrium and long-range gene regulatory mechanisms. However, 
identifying the causal gene is crucial to enable identification of potential 
drug targets and better understanding of molecular mechanisms. Mapping GWAS 
traits to known phenotypically relevant Mendelian disease genes near a locus is 
a promising approach to gene prioritization.
RESULTS: We present MendelVar, a comprehensive tool that integrates knowledge 
from four databases on Mendelian disease genes with enrichment testing for a 
range of associated functional annotations such as Human Phenotype Ontology, 
Disease Ontology and variants from ClinVar. This open web-based platform enables 
users to strengthen the case for causal importance of phenotypically matched 
candidate genes at GWAS loci. We demonstrate the use of MendelVar in post-GWAS 
gene annotation for type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, blood lipids and atopic 
dermatitis.

MOTIVATION: Cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, and virtually all types of 
cancer have subtypes. Understanding the association between cancer subtypes and 
genetic variations is fundamental to the development of targeted therapies for 
patients. Somatic mutation plays important roles in tumor development and has 
emerged as a new type of genetic variations for studying the association with 
cancer subtypes. However, the low prevalence of individual mutations poses a 
tremendous challenge to the related statistical analysis.
RESULTS: In this article, we propose an approach, subtype analysis with somatic 
mutations (SASOM), for the association analysis of cancer subtypes with somatic 
mutations. Our approach tests the association between a set of somatic mutations 
(from a genetic pathway) and subtypes, while incorporating functional 
information of the mutations into the analysis. We further propose a robust 
p-value combination procedure, DAPC, to synthesize statistical significance from 
different sources. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach has 
correct type I error and tends to be more powerful than possible alternative 
methods. In a real data application, we examine the somatic mutations from a 
cutaneous melanoma dataset, and identify a genetic pathway that is associated 
with immune-related subtypes.

Status epilepticus (SE) is a condition in which seizures are not 
self-terminating and thereby pose a serious threat to the patient's life. The 
molecular mechanisms underlying SE are likely heterogeneous and not well 
understood. Here, we reveal a role for the RNA-binding protein Fragile X-Related 
Protein 2 (FXR2P) in SE. Fxr2 KO mice display reduced sensitivity specifically 
to kainic acid-induced SE. Immunoprecipitation of FXR2P coupled to 
next-generation sequencing of associated mRNAs shows that FXR2P targets are 
enriched in genes that encode glutamatergic post-synaptic components. Of note, 
the FXR2P target transcriptome has a significant overlap with epilepsy and SE 
risk genes. In addition, Fxr2 KO mice fail to show sustained ERK1/2 
phosphorylation induced by KA and present reduced burst activity in the 
hippocampus. Taken together, our findings show that the absence of FXR2P 
decreases the expression of glutamatergic proteins, and this decrease might 
prevent self-sustained seizures.

BACKGROUND: The behavior of cells in vivo is complex and highly dynamic, as it 
results from an interplay between intercellular matrix proteins with surface 
receptors and other microenvironmental cues. Although the effects of the 
cellular niche have been investigated for a number of cell types using different 
molecular approaches, comprehensive assessments of how the global transcriptome 
responds to 3D scaffolds composed of various extracellular matrix (ECM) 
constituents at different concentrations are still lacking.
RESULTS: In this study, we explored the effects of two diverse extracellular 
matrix (ECM) components, Collagen I and Matrigel, on the transcriptional profile 
of cells in a cell culture system. Culturing Huh-7 cells on traditional cell 
culture plates (Control) or on the ECM components at different concentrations to 
modulate microenvironment properties, we have generated transcriptomics data 
that may be further explored to understand the differentiation and growth 
potential of this cell type for the development of 3D cultures. Our analysis 
infers transcription factors that are most responsible for the transcriptome 
response to the extracellular cues.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicates that the Collagen I substrate induces a robust 
transcriptional response in the Huh-7 cells, distinct from that induced by 
Matrigel. Enhanced hepatocyte markers (ALB and miR-122) reveal a potentially 
robust remodelling towards primary hepatocytes. Our results aid in defining the 
appropriate culture and transcription pathways while using hepatoma cell lines. 
As systems mimicking the in vivo structure and function of liver cells are still 
being developed, our study could potentially circumvent bottlenecks of limited 
availability of primary hepatocytes for preclinical studies of drug targets.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have enabled unbiased identification of 
genetic loci contributing to common complex diseases. Because GWAS loci often 
harbor many variants and genes, it remains a major challenge to move from GWASs' 
statistical associations to the identification of causal variants and genes that 
underlie these association signals. Researchers have applied many statistical 
and functional fine-mapping strategies to prioritize genetic variants and genes 
as potential candidates. There is no gold standard in fine-mapping approaches, 
but consistent results across different approaches can improve confidence in the 
fine-mapping findings. Here, we combined text mining with a systematic review 
and formed a catalog of 85 studies with evidence of fine mapping for at least 
one autoimmune GWAS locus. Across all fine-mapping studies, we compiled 230 GWAS 
loci with allelic heterogeneity estimates and predictions of causal variants and 
trait-relevant genes. These 230 loci included 455 combinations of 
locus-by-disease association signals with 15 autoimmune diseases. Using these 
estimates, we assessed the probability of mediating disease risk associations 
across genes in GWAS loci and identified robust signals of causal disease 
biology. We predict that this comprehensive catalog of GWAS fine-mapping efforts 
in autoimmune disease will greatly help distill the plethora of information in 
the field and inform therapeutic strategies.

The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has grown into a global pandemic and a 
major public health threat since its breakout in December 2019. To date, no 
specific therapeutic drug or vaccine for treating COVID-19 and SARS has been FDA 
approved. Previous studies suggest that berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, has 
shown various biological activities that may help against COVID-19 and SARS, 
including antiviral, anti-allergy and inflammation, hepatoprotection against 
drug- and infection-induced liver injury, as well as reducing oxidative stress. 
In particular, berberine has a wide range of antiviral activities such as 
anti-influenza, anti-hepatitis C, anti-cytomegalovirus, and anti-alphavirus. As 
an ingredient recommended in guidelines issued by the China National Health 
Commission for COVID-19 to be combined with other therapy, berberine is a 
promising orally administered therapeutic candidate against SARS-CoV and 
SARS-CoV-2. The current study comprehensively evaluates the potential 
therapeutic mechanisms of berberine in preventing and treating COVID-19 and SARS 
using computational modeling, including target mining, gene ontology enrichment, 
pathway analyses, protein-protein interaction analysis, and in silico molecular 
docking. An orally available immunotherapeutic-berberine nanomedicine, named 
NIT-X, has been developed by our group and has shown significantly increased 
oral bioavailability of berberine, increased IFN-γ production by CD8+ T cells, 
and inhibition of mast cell histamine release in vivo, suggesting a protective 
immune response. We further validated the inhibition of replication of 
SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cells line in vitro (Calu3 cells) by berberine. 
Moreover, the expression of targets including ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL-1α, IL-8, IL-6, 
and CCL-2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu3 cells were significantly suppressed by 
NIT-X. By supporting protective immunity while inhibiting pro-inflammatory 
cytokines; inhibiting viral infection and replication; inducing apoptosis; and 
protecting against tissue damage, berberine is a promising candidate in 
preventing and treating COVID-19 and SARS. Given the high oral bioavailability 
and safety of berberine nanomedicine, the current study may lead to the 
development of berberine as an orally, active therapeutic against COVID-19 and 
SARS.

BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials indicate that the immune response plays a 
significant role in coronary artery disease (CAD), a disorder impacting the 
lifespan potential. However, the identification of targets critical to the 
immune response in atheroma is still hampered by a lack of solid inference.
METHODS: Herein, we implemented a system genetics approach to identify causally 
associated immune targets implicated in atheroma. We leveraged genome-wide 
association studies to perform mapping and Mendelian randomization to assess 
causal associations between gene expression in blood cells with CAD and the 
lifespan. Expressed genes (eGenes) were prioritized in network and in 
single-cell expression derived from plaque immune cells.
RESULTS: Among 840 CAD-associated blood eGenes, 37 were predicted causally 
associated with CAD and 6 were also associated with the parental lifespan in 
Mendelian randomization. In multivariable Mendelian randomization, the impact of 
eGenes on the lifespan potential was mediated by the CAD risk. Predicted causal 
eGenes were central in network. FLT1 and CCR5 were identified as targets of 
approved drugs, whereas 22 eGenes were deemed tractable for the development of 
small molecules and antibodies. Analyses of plaque immune single-cell expression 
identified predicted causal eGenes enriched in macrophages (GPX1, C4orf3) and 
involved in ligand-receptor interactions (CCR5).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified 37 blood eGenes predicted causally associated with 
CAD. The predicted expression for 6 eGenes impacted the lifespan potential 
through the risk of CAD. Prioritization based on network, annotations, and 
single-cell expression identified targets deemed tractable for the development 
of drugs and for drug repurposing.

'Artificial Intelligence' (AI) has recently had a profound impact on areas such 
as image and speech recognition, and this progress has already translated into 
practical applications. However, in the drug discovery field, such advances 
remains scarce, and one of the reasons is intrinsic to the data used. In this 
review, we discuss aspects of, and differences in, data from different domains, 
namely the image, speech, chemical, and biological domains, the amounts of data 
available, and how relevant they are to drug discovery. Improvements in the 
future are needed with respect to our understanding of biological systems, and 
the subsequent generation of practically relevant data in sufficient quantities, 
to truly advance the field of AI in drug discovery, to enable the discovery of 
novel chemistry, with novel modes of action, which shows desirable efficacy and 
safety in the clinic.

Ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1 gene) has been linked through gain-of-function 
variants to a rare disease featuring developmental delay, alopecia, 
macrocephaly, and structural brain anomalies. ODC1 has been linked to additional 
diseases like cancer, with growing evidence for neurological contributions to 
schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety, epilepsy, learning, and suicidal 
behavior. The evidence of ODC1 connection to neural disorders highlights the 
need for a systematic analysis of ODC1 genotype-to-phenotype associations. An 
analysis of variants from ClinVar, Geno2MP, TOPMed, gnomAD, and COSMIC revealed 
an intellectual disability and seizure connected loss-of-function variant, ODC 
G84R (rs138359527, NC_000002.12:g.10444500C > T). The missense variant is found 
in ~1% of South Asian individuals and results in 2.5-fold decrease in enzyme 
function. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) reveal multiple 
functionally annotated, non-coding variants regulating ODC1 that associate with 
psychiatric/neurological phenotypes. Further dissection of RNA-Seq during fetal 
brain development and within cerebral organoids showed an association of ODC1 
expression with cell proliferation of neural progenitor cells, suggesting 
gain-of-function variants with neural over-proliferation and loss-of-function 
variants with neural depletion. The linkage from the expression data of ODC1 in 
early neural progenitor proliferation to phenotypes of neurodevelopmental delay 
and to the connection of polyamine metabolites in brain function establish ODC1 
as a bona fide neurodevelopmental disorder gene.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a cancer that occurs in the prostate with high 
morbidity and mortality. Danggui Beimu Kushen Wan (DBKW) is a classic formula 
for patients with difficult urination including PCa. This study aimed to 
investigate the molecular mechanisms of DBKW for PCa. We obtained DBKW compounds 
from our previous reviews. We identified potential targets for PCa from 
literature search, currently approved drugs and Open Targets database and 
filtered them by protein-protein interaction network analysis. We selected 26 
targets to predict three cancer-related pathways. A total of 621 compounds were 
screened via molecular docking using PyRx and AutoDock Vina against 21 targets 
for PCa, producing 13041 docking results. The binding patterns and positions 
showed that a relatively small number of tight-binding compounds from DBKW were 
predicted to interact strongly and selectively with three targets. The top five 
high-binding-affinity compounds were selected to generate a network, indicating 
that compounds from all three herbs had high binding affinity against the 21 
targets and may have potential biological activities with the targets. DBKW 
contains multi-targeting agents that could act on more than one pathway of PCa 
simultaneously. Further studies could focus on validating the computational 
results via experimental studies.

The COVID-19 disease led to an unprecedented health emergency, still ongoing 
worldwide. Given the lack of a vaccine or a clear therapeutic strategy to 
counteract the infection as well as its secondary effects, there is currently a 
pressing need to generate new insights into the SARS-CoV-2 induced host 
response. Biomedical data can help to investigate new aspects of the COVID-19 
pathogenesis, but source heterogeneity represents a major drawback and 
limitation. In this work, we applied data integration methods to develop a 
Unified Knowledge Space (UKS) and used it to identify a new set of genes 
associated with SARS-CoV-2 host response, both in vitro and in vivo. Functional 
analysis of these genes reveals possible long-term systemic effects of the 
infection, such as vascular remodelling and fibrosis. Finally, we identified a 
set of potentially relevant drugs targeting proteins involved in multiple steps 
of the host response to the virus.

Drug development involves a deep understanding of the mechanisms of action and 
possible side effects of each drug, and sometimes results in the identification 
of new and unexpected uses for drugs, termed as drug repurposing. Both in case 
of serendipitous observations and systematic mechanistic explorations, 
confirmation of new indications for a drug requires hypothesis building around 
relevant drug-related data, such as molecular targets involved, and patient and 
cellular responses. These datasets are available in public repositories, but 
apart from sifting through the sheer amount of data imposing computational 
bottleneck, a major challenge is the difficulty in selecting which databases to 
use from an increasingly large number of available databases. The database 
selection is made harder by the lack of an overview of the types of data offered 
in each database. In order to alleviate these problems and to guide the end user 
through the drug repurposing efforts, we provide here a survey of 102 of the 
most promising and drug-relevant databases reported to date. We summarize the 
target coverage and types of data available in each database and provide several 
examples of how multi-database exploration can facilitate drug repurposing.

We provide the first analysis and synthesis of the evolutionary and mechanistic 
bases for risk of endometriosis in humans, structured around Niko Tinbergen's 
four questions about phenotypes: phylogenetic history, development, mechanism 
and adaptive significance. Endometriosis, which is characterized by the 
proliferation of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus, has its phylogenetic 
roots in the evolution of three causally linked traits: (1) highly invasive 
placentation, (2) spontaneous rather than implantation-driven endometrial 
decidualization and (3) frequent extensive estrogen-driven endometrial 
proliferation and inflammation, followed by heavy menstrual bleeding. 
Endometriosis is potentiated by these traits and appears to be driven, 
proximately, by relatively low levels of prenatal and postnatal testosterone. 
Testosterone affects the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, 
and at low levels, it can result in an altered trajectory of reproductive and 
physiological phenotypes that in extreme cases can mediate the symptoms of 
endometriosis. Polycystic ovary syndrome, by contrast, is known from previous 
work to be caused primarily by high prenatal and postnatal testosterone, and it 
demonstrates a set of phenotypes opposite to those found in endometriosis. The 
hypothesis that endometriosis risk is driven by low prenatal testosterone, and 
involves extreme expression of some reproductive phenotypes, is supported by a 
suite of evidence from genetics, development, endocrinology, morphology and life 
history. The hypothesis also provides insights into why these two diametric, 
fitness-reducing disorders are maintained at such high frequencies in human 
populations. Finally, the hypotheses described and evaluated here lead to 
numerous testable predictions and have direct implications for the treatment and 
study of endometriosis. Lay summary: Endometriosis is caused by endometrial 
tissue outside of the uterus. We explain why and how humans are vulnerable to 
this disease, and new perspectives on understanding and treating it. 
Endometriosis shows evidence of being caused in part by relatively low 
testosterone during fetal development, that 'programs' female reproductive 
development. By contrast, polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with 
relatively high testosterone in prenatal development. These two disorders can 
thus be seen as 'opposite' to one another in their major causes and correlates. 
Important new insights regarding diagnosis, study and treatment of endometriosis 
follow from these considerations.

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical effectors of gene expression, and as 
such their malfunction underlies the origin of many diseases. RBPs can recognize 
hundreds of transcripts and form extensive regulatory networks that help to 
maintain cell homeostasis. System-wide unbiased identification of RBPs has 
increased the number of recognized RBPs into the four-digit range and revealed 
new paradigms: from the prevalence of structurally disordered RNA-binding 
regions with roles in the formation of membraneless organelles to unsuspected 
and potentially pervasive connections between intermediary metabolism and RNA 
regulation. Together with an increasingly detailed understanding of molecular 
mechanisms of RBP function, these insights are facilitating the development of 
new therapies to treat malignancies. Here, we provide an overview of RBPs 
involved in human genetic disorders, both Mendelian and somatic, and discuss 
emerging aspects in the field with emphasis on molecular mechanisms of disease 
and therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND: Clinical-grade whole-genome sequencing (cWGS) has the potential to 
become the standard of care within the clinic because of its breadth of coverage 
and lack of bias towards certain regions of the genome. Colorectal cancer 
presents a difficult treatment paradigm, with over 40% of patients presenting at 
diagnosis with metastatic disease. We hypothesised that cWGS coupled with 3' 
transcriptome analysis would give new insights into colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Patients underwent PCR-free whole-genome sequencing and alignment and 
variant calling using a standardised pipeline to output SNVs, indels, SVs and 
CNAs. Additional insights into the mutational signatures and tumour biology were 
gained by the use of 3' RNA-seq.
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were studied in total. Driver analysis identified 
the Wnt pathway gene APC as the only consistently mutated driver in colorectal 
cancer. Alterations in the PI3K/mTOR pathways were seen as previously observed 
in CRC. Multiple private CNAs, SVs and gene fusions were unique to individual 
tumours. Approximately 30% of patients had a tumour mutational burden of > 10 
mutations/Mb of DNA, suggesting suitability for immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical whole-genome sequencing offers a potential avenue for the 
identification of private genomic variation that may confer sensitivity to 
targeted agents and offer patients new options for targeted therapies.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), is a heritable common cause of blindness 
world-wide. To identify risk loci, we conduct a large multi-ethnic meta-analysis 
of genome-wide association studies on a total of 34,179 cases and 349,321 
controls, identifying 44 previously unreported risk loci and confirming 83 loci 
that were previously known. The majority of loci have broadly consistent effects 
across European, Asian and African ancestries. Cross-ancestry data improve 
fine-mapping of causal variants for several loci. Integration of multiple lines 
of genetic evidence support the functional relevance of the identified POAG risk 
loci and highlight potential contributions of several genes to POAG 
pathogenesis, including SVEP1, RERE, VCAM1, ZNF638, CLIC5, SLC2A12, YAP1, MXRA5, 
and SMAD6. Several drug compounds targeting POAG risk genes may be potential 
glaucoma therapeutic candidates.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is amongst the deadliest of human cancers, with a 
median survival rate of just over one year following diagnosis. Characterized by 
rapid proliferation and diffuse infiltration into the brain, GBM is notoriously 
difficult to treat, with tumor cells showing limited response to existing 
therapies and eventually developing resistance to these interventions. As such, 
there is intense interest in better understanding the molecular alterations in 
GBM to guide the development of more efficient targeted therapies. GBM tumors 
can be classified into several molecular subtypes which have distinct genetic 
signatures, and they show aberrant activation of numerous signal transduction 
pathways, particularly those connected to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which 
control glioma cell growth, survival, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. 
There are also non-canonical modes of RTK signaling found in GBM, which involve 
G-protein-coupled receptors and calcium channels. This review uses The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM dataset in combination with a data-mining approach to 
summarize disease characteristics, with a focus on select molecular pathways 
that drive GBM pathogenesis. We also present a unique genomic survey of RTKs 
that are frequently altered in GBM subtypes, as well as catalog the GBM disease 
association scores for all RTKs. Lastly, we discuss current RTK targeted 
therapies and highlight emerging directions in GBM research.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Signaling and metabolic perturbations contribute to 
dysregulated skeletal muscle protein homeostasis and secondary sarcopenia in 
response to a number of cellular stressors including ethanol exposure. Using an 
innovative multiomics-based curating of unbiased data, we identified molecular 
and metabolic therapeutic targets and experimentally validated restoration of 
protein homeostasis in an ethanol-fed mouse model of liver disease.
METHODS: Studies were performed in ethanol-treated differentiated C2C12 myotubes 
and physiological relevance established in an ethanol-fed mouse model of 
alcohol-related liver disease (mALD) or pair-fed control C57BL/6 mice. 
Transcriptome and proteome from ethanol treated-myotubes and gastrocnemius 
muscle from mALD and pair-fed mice were analyzed to identify target pathways and 
molecules. Readouts including signaling responses and autophagy markers by 
immunoblots, mitochondrial oxidative function and free radical generation, and 
metabolic studies by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and sarcopenic 
phenotype by imaging.
RESULTS: Multiomics analyses showed that ethanol impaired skeletal muscle mTORC1 
signaling, mitochondrial oxidative pathways, including intermediary metabolite 
regulatory genes, interleukin-6, and amino acid degradation pathways are 
β-hydroxymethyl-butyrate targets. Ethanol decreased mTORC1 signaling, increased 
autophagy flux, impaired mitochondrial oxidative function with decreased 
tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediary metabolites, ATP synthesis, protein 
synthesis and myotube diameter that were reversed by HMB. Consistently, skeletal 
muscle from mALD had decreased mTORC1 signaling, reduced fractional and total 
muscle protein synthesis rates, increased autophagy markers, lower intermediary 
metabolite concentrations, and lower muscle mass and fiber diameter that were 
reversed by β-hydroxymethyl-butyrate treatment.
CONCLUSION: An innovative multiomics approach followed by experimental 
validation showed that β-hydroxymethyl-butyrate restores muscle protein 
homeostasis in liver disease.

Rare diseases impact hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. However, few 
therapies exist to treat the rare disease population because financial resources 
are limited, the number of patients affected is low, bioactivity data is often 
nonexistent, and very few animal models exist to support preclinical development 
efforts. Sialidosis is an ultrarare lysosomal storage disorder in which 
mutations in the NEU1 gene result in the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme 
sialidase-1. This enzyme catalyzes the removal of sialic acid moieties from 
glycoproteins and glycolipids. Therefore, the defective or deficient protein 
leads to the buildup of sialylated glycoproteins as well as several 
characteristic symptoms of sialidosis including visual impairment, ataxia, 
hepatomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, and developmental delay. In this study, we 
used a bibliometric tool to generate links between lysosomal storage disease 
(LSD) targets and existing bioactivity data that could be curated in order to 
build machine learning models and screen compounds in silico. We focused on 
sialidase as an example, and we used the data curated from the literature to 
build a Bayesian model which was then used to score compound libraries and rank 
these molecules for in vitro testing. Two compounds were identified from in 
vitro testing using microscale thermophoresis, namely sulfameter (K d 2.15 ± 
1.02 μM) and mexenone (K d 8.88 ± 4.02 μM), which validated our approach to 
identifying new molecules binding to this protein, which could represent 
possible drug candidates that can be evaluated further as potential chaperones 
for this ultrarare lysosomal disease for which there is currently no treatment. 
Combining bibliometric and machine learning approaches has the ability to assist 
in curating small molecule data and model building, respectively, for rare 
disease drug discovery. This approach also has the capability to identify new 
compounds that are potential drug candidates.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common, serious, genetic heart disorder. 
Rare pathogenic variants in sarcomere genes cause HCM, but with unexplained 
phenotypic heterogeneity. Moreover, most patients do not carry such variants. We 
report a genome-wide association study of 2,780 cases and 47,486 controls that 
identified 12 genome-wide-significant susceptibility loci for HCM. 
Single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability indicated a strong polygenic 
influence, especially for sarcomere-negative HCM (64% of cases; 
h2g = 0.34 ± 0.02). A genetic risk score showed substantial influence on the 
odds of HCM in a validation study, halving the odds in the lowest quintile and 
doubling them in the highest quintile, and also influenced phenotypic severity 
in sarcomere variant carriers. Mendelian randomization identified diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) as a key modifiable risk factor for sarcomere-negative HCM, 
with a one standard deviation increase in DBP increasing the HCM risk fourfold. 
Common variants and modifiable risk factors have important roles in HCM that we 
suggest will be clinically actionable.

Clinical laboratory tests are a critical component of the continuum of care. We 
evaluate the genetic basis of 35 blood and urine laboratory measurements in the 
UK Biobank (n = 363,228 individuals). We identify 1,857 loci associated with at 
least one trait, containing 3,374 fine-mapped associations and additional sets 
of large-effect (>0.1 s.d.) protein-altering, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and 
copy number variant (CNV) associations. Through Mendelian randomization (MR) 
analysis, we discover 51 causal relationships, including previously known 
agonistic effects of urate on gout and cystatin C on stroke. Finally, we develop 
polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for each biomarker and build 'multi-PRS' models for 
diseases using 35 PRSs simultaneously, which improved chronic kidney disease, 
type 2 diabetes, gout and alcoholic cirrhosis genetic risk stratification in an 
independent dataset (FinnGen; n = 135,500) relative to single-disease PRSs. 
Together, our results delineate the genetic basis of biomarkers and their causal 
influences on diseases and improve genetic risk stratification for common 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, the annual incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has 
increased, with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) identified as the most 
commonwinwordpathological type accounting for approximately 80% of all thyroid 
cancer cases. The tumor microenvironment is known to play a vital role in tumor 
information transmission and immune detection.
METHODS: In the present study, we examined gene expression data from 518 
patients with PTC. The ESTIMATE algorithm was used to calculate immune and 
stromal scores of PTC patients. Based on a protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network, functional enrichment and overall survival analyses, C-X-C motif 
chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) was identified as a core gene. We further 
investigated the roles of core genes of PTC in the tumor immune microenvironment 
using LinkedOmics, GSEA, and TIMER tools.
RESULTS: Immune, stromal and ESTIMATE scores were related to clinicopathological 
variables of patients with PTC, but not survival outcomes. Eight differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with survival outcome. In addition, 
immunochemical staining experiments revealed lower expression of CXCL10 in PTC 
than paracancerous tissues. GSEA pathway enrichment analysis revealed 
downregulation of CXCL10 in multiple cancer pathways. CXCL10 and related genes 
were enriched in pathways related to adaptive immune response, cellular defense 
response and regulation of innate immune response.
CONCLUSION: The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in development of 
PTC and CXCL10 may serve as a novel target of precision therapy for this patient 
population.

Discovering drugs that efficiently treat brain diseases has been challenging. 
Genetic variants that modulate the expression of potential drug targets can be 
utilized to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. We therefore 
employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) on gene expression measured in brain 
tissue to identify drug targets involved in neurological and psychiatric 
diseases. We conducted a two-sample MR using cis-acting brain-derived expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for 
Alzheimer's Disease consortium (AMP-AD) and the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) 
meta-analysis study (n = 1,286) as genetic instruments to predict the effects of 
7,137 genes on 12 neurological and psychiatric disorders. We conducted Bayesian 
colocalization analysis on the top MR findings (using P<6x10-7 as evidence 
threshold, Bonferroni-corrected for 80,557 MR tests) to confirm sharing of the 
same causal variants between gene expression and trait in each genomic region. 
We then intersected the colocalized genes with known monogenic disease genes 
recorded in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and with genes annotated 
as drug targets in the Open Targets platform to identify promising drug targets. 
80 eQTLs showed MR evidence of a causal effect, from which we prioritised 47 
genes based on colocalization with the trait. We causally linked the expression 
of 23 genes with schizophrenia and a single gene each with anorexia, bipolar 
disorder and major depressive disorder within the psychiatric diseases and 9 
genes with Alzheimer's disease, 6 genes with Parkinson's disease, 4 genes with 
multiple sclerosis and two genes with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis within the 
neurological diseases we tested. From these we identified five genes (ACE, 
GPNMB, KCNQ5, RERE and SUOX) as attractive drug targets that may warrant 
follow-up in functional studies and clinical trials, demonstrating the value of 
this study design for discovering drug targets in neuropsychiatric diseases.

The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI; https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) 
provides freely available data and bioinformatics services to the scientific 
community, alongside its research activity and training provision. The 2020 
COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront a need for the scientific 
community to work even more cooperatively to effectively tackle a global health 
crisis. EMBL-EBI has been able to build on its position to contribute to the 
fight against COVID-19 in a number of ways. Firstly, EMBL-EBI has used its 
infrastructure, expertise and network of international collaborations to help 
build the European COVID-19 Data Platform (https://www.covid19dataportal.org/), 
which brings together COVID-19 biomolecular data and connects it to researchers, 
clinicians and public health professionals. By September 2020, the COVID-19 Data 
Platform has integrated in excess of 170 000 COVID-19 biomolecular data and 
literature records, collected through a number of EMBL-EBI resources. Secondly, 
EMBL-EBI has strived to continue its support of the life science communities 
through the crisis, with updated Training provision and improved service 
provision throughout its resources. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the 
importance of EMBL-EBI's core principles, including international cooperation, 
resource sharing and central data brokering, and has further empowered 
scientific cooperation.

The aim of the UniProt Knowledgebase is to provide users with a comprehensive, 
high-quality and freely accessible set of protein sequences annotated with 
functional information. In this article, we describe significant updates that we 
have made over the last two years to the resource. The number of sequences in 
UniProtKB has risen to approximately 190 million, despite continued work to 
reduce sequence redundancy at the proteome level. We have adopted new methods of 
assessing proteome completeness and quality. We continue to extract detailed 
annotations from the literature to add to reviewed entries and supplement these 
in unreviewed entries with annotations provided by automated systems such as the 
newly implemented Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA). We have developed a 
credit-based publication submission interface to allow the community to 
contribute publications and annotations to UniProt entries. We describe how 
UniProtKB responded to the COVID-19 pandemic through expert curation of relevant 
entries that were rapidly made available to the research community through a 
dedicated portal. UniProt resources are available under a CC-BY (4.0) license 
via the web at https://www.uniprot.org/.

The Open Targets Platform (https://www.targetvalidation.org/) provides users 
with a queryable knowledgebase and user interface to aid systematic target 
identification and prioritisation for drug discovery based upon underlying 
evidence. It is publicly available and the underlying code is open source. Since 
our last update two years ago, we have had 10 releases to maintain and 
continuously improve evidence for target-disease relationships from 20 different 
data sources. In addition, we have integrated new evidence from key datasets, 
including prioritised targets identified from genome-wide CRISPR knockout 
screens in 300 cancer models (Project Score), and GWAS/UK BioBank statistical 
genetic analysis evidence from the Open Targets Genetics Portal. We have evolved 
our evidence scoring framework to improve target identification. To aid the 
prioritisation of targets and inform on the potential impact of modulating a 
given target, we have added evaluation of post-marketing adverse drug reactions 
and new curated information on target tractability and safety. We have also 
developed the user interface and backend technologies to improve performance and 
usability. In this article, we describe the latest enhancements to the Platform, 
to address the fundamental challenge that developing effective and safe drugs is 
difficult and expensive.

CRISPR genetic screens in cancer cell models are a powerful tool to elucidate 
oncogenic mechanisms and to identify promising therapeutic targets. The Project 
Score database (https://score.depmap.sanger.ac.uk/) uses genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 
dropout screening data in hundreds of highly annotated cancer cell models to 
identify genes required for cell fitness and prioritize novel oncology targets. 
The Project Score database currently allows users to investigate the fitness 
effect of 18 009 genes tested across 323 cancer cell models. Through interactive 
interfaces, users can investigate data by selecting a specific gene, cancer cell 
model or tissue type, as well as browsing all gene fitness scores. Additionally, 
users can identify and rank candidate drug targets based on an established 
oncology target prioritization pipeline, incorporating genetic biomarkers and 
clinical datasets for each target, and including suitability for drug 
development based on pharmaceutical tractability. Data are freely available and 
downloadable. To enhance analyses, links to other key resources including Open 
Targets, COSMIC, the Cell Model Passports, UniProt and the Genomics of Drug 
Sensitivity in Cancer are provided. The Project Score database is a valuable new 
tool for investigating genetic dependencies in cancer cells and the 
identification of candidate oncology targets.

Open Targets Genetics (https://genetics.opentargets.org) is an open-access 
integrative resource that aggregates human GWAS and functional genomics data 
including gene expression, protein abundance, chromatin interaction and 
conformation data from a wide range of cell types and tissues to make robust 
connections between GWAS-associated loci, variants and likely causal genes. This 
enables systematic identification and prioritisation of likely causal variants 
and genes across all published trait-associated loci. In this paper, we describe 
the public resources we aggregate, the technology and analyses we use, and the 
functionality that the portal offers. Open Targets Genetics can be searched by 
variant, gene or study/phenotype. It offers tools that enable users to 
prioritise causal variants and genes at disease-associated loci and access 
systematic cross-disease and disease-molecular trait colocalization analysis 
across 92 cell types and tissues including the eQTL Catalogue. Data 
visualizations such as Manhattan-like plots, regional plots, credible sets 
overlap between studies and PheWAS plots enable users to explore GWAS signals in 
depth. The integrated data is made available through the web portal, for bulk 
download and via a GraphQL API, and the software is open source. Applications of 
this integrated data include identification of novel targets for drug discovery 
and drug repurposing.

Marine organisms are expected to be an important source of inspiration for drug 
discovery after terrestrial plants and microorganisms. Despite the remarkable 
progress in the field of marine natural products (MNPs) chemistry, there are 
only a few open access databases dedicated to MNPs research. To meet the growing 
demand for mining and sharing for MNPs-related data resources, we developed 
CMNPD, a comprehensive marine natural products database based on manually 
curated data. CMNPD currently contains more than 31 000 chemical entities with 
various physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, standardized biological 
activity data, systematic taxonomy and geographical distribution of source 
organisms, and detailed literature citations. It is an integrated platform for 
structure dereplication (assessment of novelty) of (marine) natural products, 
discovery of lead compounds, data mining of structure-activity relationships and 
investigation of chemical ecology. Access is available through a user-friendly 
web interface at https://www.cmnpd.org. We are committed to providing a free 
data sharing platform for not only professional MNPs researchers but also the 
broader scientific community to facilitate drug discovery from the ocean.

Although thousands of loci have been associated with human phenotypes, the role 
of gene-environment (GxE) interactions in determining individual risk of human 
diseases remains unclear. This is partly because of the severe erosion of 
statistical power resulting from the massive number of statistical tests 
required to detect such interactions. Here, we focus on improving the power of 
GxE tests by developing a statistical framework for assessing quantitative trait 
loci (QTLs) associated with the trait means and/or trait variances. When 
applying this framework to body mass index (BMI), we find that GxE discovery and 
replication rates are significantly higher when prioritizing genetic variants 
associated with the variance of the phenotype (vQTLs) compared to when assessing 
all genetic variants. Moreover, we find that vQTLs are enriched for associations 
with other non-BMI phenotypes having strong environmental influences, such as 
diabetes or ulcerative colitis. We show that GxE effects first identified in 
quantitative traits such as BMI can be used for GxE discovery in disease 
phenotypes such as diabetes. A clear conclusion is that strong GxE interactions 
mediate the genetic contribution to body weight and diabetes risk.

Germline genetic variants have been identified, which predispose individuals and 
families to develop melanoma. Tumor thickness is the strongest predictor of 
outcome for clinically localized primary melanoma patients. We sought to 
determine whether there is a heritable genetic contribution to variation in 
tumor thickness. If confirmed, this will justify the search for specific genetic 
variants influencing tumor thickness. To address this, we estimated the 
proportion of variation in tumor thickness attributable to genome-wide genetic 
variation (variant-based heritability) using unrelated patients with measured 
primary cutaneous melanoma thickness. As a secondary analysis, we conducted a 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) of tumor thickness. The analyses utilized 
10 604 individuals with primary cutaneous melanoma drawn from nine GWAS datasets 
from eight cohorts recruited from the general population, primary care and 
melanoma treatment centers. Following quality control and filtering to unrelated 
individuals with study phenotypes, 8125 patients were used in the primary 
analysis to test whether tumor thickness is heritable. An expanded set of 8505 
individuals (47.6% female) were analyzed for the secondary GWAS meta-analysis. 
Analyses were adjusted for participant age, sex, cohort and ancestry. We found 
that 26.6% (SE 11.9%, P = 0.0128) of variation in tumor thickness is 
attributable to genome-wide genetic variation. While requiring replication, a 
chromosome 11 locus was associated (P < 5 × 10-8) with tumor thickness. Our work 
indicates that sufficiently large datasets will enable the discovery of genetic 
variants associated with greater tumor thickness, and this will lead to the 
identification of host biological processes influencing melanoma growth and 
invasion.

Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting >125 million 
individuals worldwide. The therapeutic course for the disease is generally 
designed upon the severity of the disease. In the present study, the gene 
expression profile GSE78097, was retrieved from the National Centre of 
Biotechnology (NCBI)‑Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to explore the 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in mild and severe psoriasis using the 
Affy package in R software. The Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathways of the DEGs were analysed using clusterProfiler, Bioconductor, 
version 3.8. In addition, the STRING database was used to develop DEG‑encoded 
proteins and a protein‑protein interaction network (PPI). Cytoscape software, 
version 3.7.1 was utilized to construct a protein interaction association 
network and analyse the interaction of the candidate DEGs encoding proteins in 
psoriasis. The top 2 hub genes in Cytohubba plugin parameters were validated 
using immunohistochemical analysis in psoriasis tissues. A total of 382 and 
3,001 dysregulated mild and severe psoriasis DEGs were reported, respectively. 
The dysregulated mild psoriasis genes were enriched in pathways involving 
cytokine‑cytokine receptor interaction and rheumatoid arthritis, whereas 
cytokine‑cytokine receptor interaction, cell cycle and cell adhesion molecules 
were the most enriched pathways in severe psoriasis group. PL1N1, TLR4, ADIPOQ, 
CXCL8, PDK4, CXCL1, CXCL5, LPL, AGT, LEP were hub genes in mild psoriasis, 
whereas BUB1, CCNB1, CCNA2, CDK1, CDH1, VEGFA, PLK1, CDC42, CCND1 and CXCL8 were 
reported hub genes in severe psoriasis. Among these, CDC42, for the first time 
(to the best of our knowledge), has been reported in the psoriasis 
transcriptome, with its involvement in the adaptive immune pathway. Furthermore, 
the immunoexpression of CDK1 and CDH1 proteins in psoriasis skin lesions were 
demonstrated using immunohistochemical analysis. On the whole, the findings of 
the present integrated bioinformatics and immunohistochemical study, may enhance 
our understanding of the molecular events occurring in psoriasis, and these 
candidate genes and pathways together may prove to be therapeutic targets for 
psoriasis vulgaris.

Radix Angelicae biseratae is a widely used Chinese traditional herbal medicine 
for osteoarthritis (OA). Its therapeutic efficacy has been confirmed in clinical 
practice. However, its mechanisms of action in treating OA have remained 
elusive. The purpose of the present study was to identify active components with 
good oral bioavailability and drug-like properties from Radix Angelicae 
biseratae through systematic pharmacology and in vitro experiments to determine 
targets of Radix Angelicae biseratae in the treatment of OA. The functional 
components of Radix Angelicae biseratae were screened from the Traditional 
Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database based on oral bioavailability and 
drug-like properties. Subsequently, the databases STITCH, Open Targets Platform 
and DrugBank were searched and microarray analysis was performed to screen the 
active components of Radix Angelicae biseratae to treat OA and predict its 
potential target proteins. The interaction network and protein interaction 
network were then generated and examined, molecular docking between active 
components and targets was performed and the enrichment of potential target 
proteins was analyzed. Finally, reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR and 
western blot analyses were used to verify the therapeutic effect of Radix 
Angelicae biseratae extract on the expression of OA-associated target proteins. 
The results provided eight active components in Radix Angelicae biseratae, which 
were firmly linked to 20 targets of OA. In combination with molecular docking 
and the analysis of the interaction network between components and targets, it 
was suggested that sitosterol was a major active component of Radix Angelicae 
biseratae in the treatment of OA. Protein interaction network analysis suggested 
that prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), nitric oxide synthase 3 and 
cytochrome P450 2B6 may be critical targets for Radix Angelicae biseratae in the 
treatment of OA. In addition, RT-qPCR and western blot analyses suggested that 
Radix Angelicae biseratae extract inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of 
PTGS2 in degenerative articular cartilage cells in vitro, whilst other targets 
remain to be verified. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that Radix 
Angelicae biseratae confers pharmacological efficacy towards OA through exerting 
anti-inflammatory effects and immune regulation.

Academic research plays a key role in identifying new drug targets, including 
understanding target biology and links between targets and disease states. To 
lead to new drugs, however, research must progress from purely academic 
exploration to the initiation of efforts to identify and test a drug candidate 
in clinical trials, which are typically conducted by the biopharma industry. 
This transition can be facilitated by a timely focus on target assessment 
aspects such as target-related safety issues, druggability and assayability, as 
well as the potential for target modulation to achieve differentiation from 
established therapies. Here, we present recommendations from the GOT-IT working 
group, which have been designed to support academic scientists and funders of 
translational research in identifying and prioritizing target assessment 
activities and in defining a critical path to reach scientific goals as well as 
goals related to licensing, partnering with industry or initiating clinical 
development programmes. Based on sets of guiding questions for different areas 
of target assessment, the GOT-IT framework is intended to stimulate academic 
scientists' awareness of factors that make translational research more robust 
and efficient, and to facilitate academia-industry collaboration.

Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) is an endoplasmic reticulum 
resident protein that is essential for the assembly and secretion of 
triglyceride (TG)-rich, apoB-containing lipoproteins. Although the function and 
structure of mammalian MTTP have been extensively studied, how exactly MTTP 
transfers lipids to lipid acceptors and whether there are other biomolecules 
involved in MTTP-mediated lipid transport remain elusive. Here we identify a 
role in this process for the poorly characterized protein PRAP1. We report that 
PRAP1 and MTTP are partially colocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum. We 
observe that PRAP1 directly binds to TG and facilitates MTTP-mediated lipid 
transfer. A single amino acid mutation at position 85 (E85V) impairs PRAP1's 
ability to form a ternary complex with TG and MTTP, as well as impairs its 
ability to facilitate MTTP-mediated apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly and 
secretion, suggesting that the ternary complex formation is required for PRAP1 
to facilitate MTTP-mediated lipid transport. PRAP1 is detectable in 
chylomicron/VLDL-rich plasma fractions, suggesting that MTTP recognizes 
PRAP1-bound TG as a cargo and transfers TG along with PRAP1 to lipid acceptors. 
Both PRAP1-deficient and E85V knock-in mutant mice fed a chow diet manifested an 
increase in the length of their small intestines, likely to compensate for 
challenges in absorbing lipid. Interestingly, both genetically modified mice 
gained significantly less body weight and fat mass when on high-fat diets 
compared with littermate controls and were prevented from hepatosteatosis. 
Together, this study provides evidence that PRAP1 plays an important role in 
MTTP-mediated lipid transport and lipid absorption.

BACKGROUND: Severe asthma exacerbations are a major cause of asthma morbidity 
and increased healthcare costs. Several studies have shown racial and ethnic 
differences in asthma exacerbation rates. We aimed to identify genetic variants 
associated with severe exacerbations in two high-risk populations for asthma.
METHODS: A genome-wide association study of asthma in children and youth with 
severe exacerbations was performed in 1283 exacerbators and 2027 controls 
without asthma of Latino ancestry. Independent suggestive variants (P ≤ 5 × 10-6 
) were selected for replication in 448 African Americans exacerbators and 595 
controls. Case-only analyses were performed comparing the exacerbators with 
additional 898 Latinos and 524 African Americans asthma patients without 
exacerbations, while adjusting by treatment category as a proxy of asthma 
severity. We analyzed the functionality of associated variants with in silico 
methods and by correlating genotypes with methylation levels in whole blood in a 
subset of 473 Latinos.
RESULTS: We identified two genome-wide significant associations for 
susceptibility to asthma with severe exacerbations, including a novel locus 
located at chromosome 2p21 (rs4952375, odds ratio = 1.39, P = 3.8 × 10-8 ), 
which was also associated with asthma exacerbations in a case-only analysis 
(odds ratio = 1.25, P = 1.95 × 10-3 ). This polymorphism is an expression 
quantitative trait locus of the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1913 
(LINC01913) in lung tissues (P = 1.3 × 10-7 ) and influences methylation levels 
of the protein kinase domain-containing cytoplasmic (PKDCC) gene in whole-blood 
cells (P = 9.8 × 10-5 ).
CONCLUSION: We identified a novel susceptibility locus for severe asthma 
exacerbations in Hispanic/Latino and African American youths with functional 
effects in gene expression and methylation status of neighboring genes.

Prevention of hyperlipidemia and associated diseases is a health priority. 
Natural products, such as the medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidum (Gl), have 
demonstrated hypocholesterolemic, prebiotic and antidiabetic properties. 
However, the underlying transcriptomic mechanisms by which Gl exerts 
bioactivities are not completely understood. We report a comprehensive hepatic 
and renal transcriptome profiling of C57BL/6 mice under the consumption of a 
high-cholesterol diet and two standardized Gl extracts obtained from 
basidiocarps cultivated on conventional substrate (Gl-1) or substrate containing 
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; Gl-2). We showed that Gl extracts modulate relevant 
metabolic pathways involving the restriction of lipid biosynthesis and the 
enrichment of lipid degradation and secretion. The Gl-2 extract exerts a major 
modulation over gene expression programs showing the highest similarity with 
simvastatin druggable-target-genes and these are enriched more in processes 
related to human obesity alterations in the liver. We further show a subset of 
Gl-modulated genes correlated with Lactobacillus enrichment and the reduction of 
circulating cholesterol-derived fats. Moreover, Gl extracts induce a significant 
decrease of macrophage lipid storage, which occurs concomitantly with the 
down-modulation of Fasn and Elovl6. Collectively, this evidence suggests a new 
link between Gl hypocholesterolemic and prebiotic activity, revealing thereby

We report a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis, including whole-genome 
sequencing, RNA sequencing, and proteomics and phosphoproteomics profiling, of 
218 tumors across 7 histological types of childhood brain cancer: low-grade 
glioma (n = 93), ependymoma (32), high-grade glioma (25), medulloblastoma (22), 
ganglioglioma (18), craniopharyngioma (16), and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor 
(12). Proteomics data identify common biological themes that span histological 
boundaries, suggesting that treatments used for one histological type may be 
applied effectively to other tumors sharing similar proteomics features. Immune 
landscape characterization reveals diverse tumor microenvironments across and 
within diagnoses. Proteomics data further reveal functional effects of somatic 
mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) not evident in transcriptomics data. 
Kinase-substrate association and co-expression network analysis identify 
important biological mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This is the first large-scale 
proteogenomics analysis across traditional histological boundaries to uncover 
foundational pediatric brain tumor biology and inform rational treatment 
selection.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer greatly threatens the general health of women 
worldwide. Implementation of predictive prognostic biomarkers aids in ovarian 
cancer management.
METHODS: Using online databases, the general expression profile, target-disease 
associations, and interaction network of PAWR were explored. To identify the 
role of PAWR in ovarian cancer, gene correlation analysis, survival analysis, 
and combined analysis of drug responsiveness and PAWR expression were performed. 
The predictive prognostic value of PAWR was further validated in clinical 
samples.
RESULTS: PAWR was widely expressed in normal and cancer tissues, with decreased 
expression in ovarian cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. PAWR was 
associated with various cancers including ovarian cancer. PAWR formed a 
regulatory network with a group of proteins and correlated with several genes, 
which were both implicated in ovarian cancer and drug responsiveness. High PAWR 
expression denoted better survival in ovarian cancer patients (OS: HR = 0.84, 
P = 0.0077; PFS, HR = 0.86, P = 0.049). Expression of PAWR could predict 
platinum responsiveness in ovarian cancer and there was a positive correlation 
between PAWR gene effect and paclitaxel sensitivity. In 12 paired clinical 
samples, the cancerous tissues exhibited significantly lower PAWR expression 
than matched normal fallopian tubes. The predictive prognostic value of PAWR was 
maintained in a cohort of 50 ovarian cancer patients.
CONCLUSIONS: High PAWR expression indicated better survival and higher drug 
responsiveness in ovarian cancer patients. PAWR could be exploited as a 
predictive prognostic biomarker in ovarian cancer.

Interferon-β (IFN-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine used for therapy of multiple 
sclerosis, which is also effective in suppression of viral and bacterial 
infections and cancer. Recently, we reported a highly specific interaction 
between IFN-β and S100P lowering IFN-β cytotoxicity to cancer cells (Int J Biol 
Macromol. 2020; 143: 633-639). S100P is a member of large family of 
multifunctional Ca2+-binding proteins with cytokine-like activities. To probe 
selectivity of IFN-β-S100 interaction with respect to S100 proteins, we used 
surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, chemical crosslinking, and crystal 
violet assay. Among the thirteen S100 proteins studied S100A1, S100A4, and 
S100A6 proteins exhibit strictly Ca2+-dependent binding to IFN-β with 
equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd, of 0.04-1.5 µM for their Ca2+-bound 
homodimeric forms. Calcium depletion abolishes the S100-IFN-β interactions. 
Monomerization of S100A1/A4/A6 decreases Kd values down to 0.11-1.0 nM. 
Interferon-α is unable of binding to the S100 proteins studied. S100A1/A4 
proteins inhibit IFN-β-induced suppression of MCF-7 cells viability. The 
revealed direct influence of specific S100 proteins on IFN-β activity uncovers a 
novel regulatory role of particular S100 proteins, and opens up novel approaches 
to enhancement of therapeutic efficacy of IFN-β.

The human proteome is a crucial intermediate between complex diseases and their 
genetic and environmental components, and an important source of drug 
development targets and biomarkers. Here, we comprehensively assess the genetic 
architecture of 257 circulating protein biomarkers of cardiometabolic relevance 
through high-depth (22.5×) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 1328 individuals. We 
discover 131 independent sequence variant associations (P < 7.45 × 10-11) across 
the allele frequency spectrum, all of which replicate in an independent cohort 
(n = 1605, 18.4x WGS). We identify for the first time replicating evidence for 
rare-variant cis-acting protein quantitative trait loci for five genes, 
involving both coding and noncoding variation. We construct and validate 
polygenic scores that explain up to 45% of protein level variation. We find 
causal links between protein levels and disease risk, identifying high-value 
biomarkers and drug development targets.

There is increasing evidence that pleiotropy, the association of multiple traits 
with the same genetic variants/loci, is a very common phenomenon. 
Cross-phenotype association tests are often used to jointly analyze multiple 
traits from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The underlying methods, 
however, are often designed to test the global null hypothesis that there is no 
association of a genetic variant with any of the traits, the rejection of which 
does not implicate pleiotropy. In this article, we propose a new statistical 
approach, PLACO, for specifically detecting pleiotropic loci between two traits 
by considering an underlying composite null hypothesis that a variant is 
associated with none or only one of the traits. We propose testing the null 
hypothesis based on the product of the Z-statistics of the genetic variants 
across two studies and derive a null distribution of the test statistic in the 
form of a mixture distribution that allows for fractions of variants to be 
associated with none or only one of the traits. We borrow approaches from the 
statistical literature on mediation analysis that allow asymptotic approximation 
of the null distribution avoiding estimation of nuisance parameters related to 
mixture proportions and variance components. Simulation studies demonstrate that 
the proposed method can maintain type I error and can achieve major power gain 
over alternative simpler methods that are typically used for testing pleiotropy. 
PLACO allows correlation in summary statistics between studies that may arise 
due to sharing of controls between disease traits. Application of PLACO to 
publicly available summary data from two large case-control GWAS of Type 2 
Diabetes and of Prostate Cancer implicated a number of novel shared genetic 
regions: 3q23 (ZBTB38), 6q25.3 (RGS17), 9p22.1 (HAUS6), 9p13.3 (UBAP2), 11p11.2 
(RAPSN), 14q12 (AKAP6), 15q15 (KNL1) and 18q23 (ZNF236).

Genetic evidence of disease association has often been used as a basis for 
selecting of drug targets for complex common diseases. Likewise, the propagation 
of genetic evidence through gene or protein interaction networks has been shown 
to accurately infer novel disease associations at genes for which no direct 
genetic evidence can be observed. However, an empirical test of the utility of 
combining these approaches for drug discovery has been lacking. In this study, 
we examine genetic associations arising from an analysis of 648 UK Biobank GWAS 
and evaluate whether targets identified as proxies of direct genetic hits are 
enriched for successful drug targets, as measured by historical clinical trial 
data. We find that protein networks formed from specific functional linkages 
such as protein complexes and ligand-receptor pairs are suitable for even naïve 
guilt-by-association network propagation approaches. In addition, more 
sophisticated approaches applied to global protein-protein interaction networks 
and pathway databases, also successfully retrieve targets enriched for 
clinically successful drug targets. We conclude that network propagation of 
genetic evidence can be used for drug target identification.

The International Molecular Exchange (IMEx) Consortium provides scientists with 
a single body of experimentally verified protein interactions curated in rich 
contextual detail to an internationally agreed standard. In this update to the 
work of the IMEx Consortium, we discuss how this initiative has been working in 
practice, how it has ensured database sustainability, and how it is meeting 
emerging annotation challenges through the introduction of new interactor types

used by biomedical researchers and integrated in other bioinformatic tools and 
resources.

Central and peripheral tolerance both contribute to protection against 
autoimmunity. The pathogenesis of autoimmunity, however, can result from 
critical deficits or limitations in peripheral and/or central tolerance 
mechanisms, presenting an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Recent 
advances highlight the substantial impact of inhibitory receptors (IRs), which 
mediate peripheral tolerance, in autoimmunity. Deletion and blockade studies in 
mice, IR disruption in humans, and correlation with positive disease outcomes 
all highlight potential clinical benefits of enhancing IR signaling 
(agonism)-specifically CTLA4, PD1, LAG3, TIM3 and TIGIT-to treat autoimmune 
disease. Although critical questions remain, IR agonists represent an 
unappreciated and untapped opportunity for the treatment of autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, causing 
over 17 million deaths per year, which outpaces global cancer mortality rates. 
Despite these sobering statistics, most bioinformatics and computational biology 
research and funding to date has been concentrated predominantly on cancer 
research, with a relatively modest footprint in CVD. In this paper, we review 
the existing literary landscape and critically assess the unmet need to further 
develop an emerging field at the multidisciplinary interface of bioinformatics 
and precision cardiovascular medicine, which we refer to as 'cardioinformatics'.

The drug discovery process starts with identification of a disease-modifying 
target. This critical step traditionally begins with manual investigation of 
scientific literature and biomedical databases to gather evidence linking 
molecular target to disease, and to evaluate the efficacy, safety and commercial 
potential of the target. The high-throughput and affordability of current omics 
technologies, allowing quantitative measurements of many putative targets (e.g. 
DNA, RNA, protein, metabolite), has exponentially increased the volume of 
scientific data available for this arduous task. Therefore, computational 
platforms identifying and ranking disease-relevant targets from existing 
biomedical data sources, including omics databases, are needed. To date, more 
than 30 drug target discovery (DTD) platforms exist. They provide 
information-rich databases and graphical user interfaces to help scientists 
identify putative targets and pre-evaluate their therapeutic efficacy and 
potential side effects. Here we survey and compare a set of popular DTD 
platforms that utilize multiple data sources and omics-driven knowledge bases 
(either directly or indirectly) for identifying drug targets. We also provide a 
description of omics technologies and related data repositories which are 
important for DTD tasks.

Biomedical information mining is increasingly recognized as a promising 
technique to accelerate drug discovery and development. Especially, integrative 
approaches which mine data from several (open) data sources have become more 
attractive with the increasing possibilities to programmatically access data 
through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The use of open data in 
conjunction with free, platform-independent analytic tools provides the 
additional advantage of flexibility, re-usability, and transparency. Here, we 
present a strategy for performing ligand-based in silico drug repurposing with 
the analytics platform KNIME. We demonstrate the usefulness of the developed 
workflow on the basis of two different use cases: a rare disease (here: Glucose 
Transporter Type 1 (GLUT-1) deficiency), and a new disease (here: COVID 19). The 
workflow includes a targeted download of data through web services, data 
curation, detection of enriched structural patterns, as well as substructure 
searches in DrugBank and a recently deposited data set of antiviral drugs 
provided by Chemical Abstracts Service. Developed workflows, tutorials with 
detailed step-by-step instructions, and the information gained by the analysis 
of data for GLUT-1 deficiency syndrome and COVID-19 are made freely available to 
the scientific community. The provided framework can be reused by researchers 
for other in silico drug repurposing projects, and it should serve as a valuable 
teaching resource for conveying integrative data mining strategies.

Transcriptome profiling approaches have been widely used to investigate the 
mechanisms underlying psoriasis pathogenesis. Most researchers have measured 
changes in transcript abundance in skin biopsies; relatively few have examined 
transcriptome changes in the blood. Although less relevant to the study of 
psoriasis pathogenesis, blood transcriptome profiles can be readily compared 
across various diseases. Here, we used a pre-established set of 382 
transcriptional modules as a common framework to compare changes in blood 
transcript abundance in two independent public psoriasis datasets. We then 
compared the resulting "transcriptional fingerprints" to those obtained for a 
reference set of 16 pathological or physiological states. The perturbations in 
blood transcript abundance in psoriasis were relatively subtle compared to the 
changes we observed in other autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases. However, 
we did observe a consistent pattern of changes for a set of modules associated 
with neutrophil activation and inflammation; interestingly, this pattern 
resembled that observed in patients with Kawasaki disease. This similarity 
between the blood-transcriptome signatures in psoriasis and Kawasaki disease 
suggests that the immune mechanisms driving their pathogenesis might be 
partially shared.

Drug Discovery is a lengthy and costly process and has faced a period of 
declining productivity within the last two decades resulting in increasing 
importance of integrative data-driven approaches. In this paper, data mining and 
integration is leveraged to inspect target innovation trends in drug discovery. 
The study highlights protein families and classes that have received more 
attention and those that have just emerged in the scientific literature, thus 
highlighting novel opportunities for drug intervention. In order to delineate 
the evolution of target-driven research interest from a biological perspective, 
trends in biological process annotations from Gene Ontology and disease 
annotations from DisGeNET are captured. The analysis reveals an increasing 
interest in targets related to immune system processes, and a recurrent trend 
for targets involved in circulatory system processes. At the level of diseases, 
targets associated with cancer-related pathologies, intellectual disability, and 
schizophrenia are increasingly investigated in recent years. The methodology 
enables researchers to capture trends in research attention in target space at 
an early stage during the drug discovery process. Workflows, scripts, and data 
used in this study are publicly available from 
https://github.com/BZdrazil/Moving_Targets . An interactive web application 
allows the customized exploration of target, biological process, and disease 
trends (available at https://rguha.shinyapps.io/MovingTargets/ ).

Elucidating the relation between the medicines: targets, targets: diseases and 
diseases: diseases are of fundamental significance as-is for societal benefit. 
Hypertension is one of the dangerous health conditions prevalent in society, is 
a risk factor for several other diseases if left untreated and 
anti-hypertensives (AHs) are the approved drugs to treat it. The goal of the 
study is to decipher the connection between hypertension with other health 
conditions, however, is challenging due to the large interactome. To fulfill the 
aim, the strategy involves prior clustering of the AHs into groups as per our 
previous method, followed by the analyzing functional association of the target 
coding-genes (tc-genes) and health conditions for each group. Following our 
recently published work where the AHs are clustered into six groups such that 
molecules having similar patterns come together, here, the distribution of 
molecular functions and the cellular components adopted by the tc-genes of each 
group are analyzed. The analyses indicate that kidney, heart, brain or lung 
related ailments are commonly associated with the tc-genes. The association of 
selective tc-genes to health conditions suggests a preference for certain health 
conditions despite many possibilities. Analyses of experimentally validated 
drug-drug combinations indicate the trend in successful AHs combinations. 
Clinically validated combinations bind different targets. Our study provides a 
promising methodology in a network-based approach that considers the influence 
of structural diversity of AHs to the functional perspective of tc-genes 
concerning the health conditions. The method could be extended to explore 
disease-disease relationships.

ABSTRACT: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women. We 
employed in silico model to predict the mechanism of actions of selected novel 
compounds reported against breast cancer using ADMET profiling, drug likeness 
and molecular docking analyses. The selected compounds were andrographolide 
(AGP), dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid (DPA), 3-(4-Bromo 
phenylazo)-2,4-pentanedione (BPP), atorvastatin (ATS), benzylserine (BZS) and 
3β,7β,25-trihydroxycucurbita-5,23(E)-dien-19-al (TCD). These compounds largely 
conform to ADMETlab and Lipinki's rule of drug likeness criteria in addition to 
their lesser hepatotoxic and mutagenic effects. Docking studies revealed a 
strong affinity of AGP versus NF-kB (- 6.8 kcal/mol), DPA versus 
Cutlike-homeobox (- 5.1 kcal/mol), BPP versus Hypoxia inducing factor 1 
(- 7.7 kcal/mol), ATS versus Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2 
(- 7.2 kcal/mol), BZS versus Ephrin type-A receptor 2 (- 4.4 kcal/mol) and TCD 
versus Ying Yang 1 (- 9.4 kcal/mol). Likewise, interaction between the said 
compounds and respective gene products were evidently observed with strong 
affinities; AGP versus COX-2 (- 9.6 kcal/mol), DPA versus Fibroblast growth 
factor receptor (- 5.9 kcal/mol), BPP versus Vascular endothelial growth factor 
(- 5.8 kcal/mol), ATS versus HMG-COA reductase (- 9.1 kcal/mol), BZS versus 
L-type amino acid transporter 1 (- 5.3 kcal/mol) and TCD versus Histone 
deacytylase (- 7.7 kcal/mol), respectively. The compounds might potentially 
target transcription through inhibition of promoter-transcription factor binding 
and/or inactivation of final gene product. Thus, findings from this study 
provide a possible mechanism of action of these xenobiotics to guide in vitro 
and in vivo studies in breast cancer.

One of the visions of precision medicine has been to re-define disease 
taxonomies based on molecular characteristics rather than on phenotypic 
evidence. However, achieving this goal is highly challenging, specifically in 
neurology. Our contribution is a machine-learning based joint molecular 
subtyping of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), based on the genetic 
burden of 15 molecular mechanisms comprising 27 proteins (e.g. APOE) that have 
been described in both diseases. We demonstrate that our joint AD/PD clustering 
using a combination of sparse autoencoders and sparse non-negative matrix 
factorization is reproducible and can be associated with significant differences 
of AD and PD patient subgroups on a clinical, pathophysiological and molecular 
level. Hence, clusters are disease-associated. To our knowledge this work is the 
first demonstration of a mechanism based stratification in the field of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, we thus see this work as an important step 
towards a molecular mechanism-based taxonomy of neurological disorders, which 
could help in developing better targeted therapies in the future by going beyond 
classical phenotype based disease definitions.

To elucidate how variants in genetic risk loci previously implicated in 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) contribute to 
expression of disease phenotypes, a phenome-wide association study was performed 
in two waves. In the first wave, we explored clinical traits associated with 
thirteen genetic variants previously reported to be linked to disease risk using 
both the 23andMe and UKB cohorts. We tested 30 additional AD variants in UKB 
cohort only in the second wave. APOE variants defining ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles and 
rs646776 were identified to be significantly associated with 
metabolic/cardiovascular and longevity traits. APOE variants were also 
significantly associated with neurological traits. ABI3 variant rs28394864 was 
significantly associated with cardiovascular (e.g. (hypertension, ischemic heart 
disease, coronary atherosclerosis, angina) and immune-related trait asthma. Both 
APOE variants and CLU variant were significantly associated with 
nearsightedness. HLA- DRB1 variant was associated with diseases with 
immune-related traits. Additionally, variants from 10+ AD genes (BZRAP1-AS1, 
ADAMTS4, ADAM10, APH1B, SCIMP, ABI3, SPPL2A, ZNF232, GRN, CD2AP, and CD33) were 
associated with hematological measurements such as white blood cell (leukocyte) 
count, monocyte count, neutrophill count, platelet count, and/or mean platelet 
(thrombocyte) volume (an autoimmune disease biomarker). Many of these genes are 
expressed specifically in microglia. The associations of ABI3 variant with 
cardiovascular and immune-related traits are one of the novel findings from this 
study. Taken together, it is evidenced that at least some AD and FTD variants 
are associated with multiple clinical phenotypes and not just dementia. These 
findings were discussed in the context of causal relationship versus pleiotropy 
via Mendelian randomization analysis.

BACKGROUND: Efforts to elucidate the function of enhancers in vivo are underway 
but their vast numbers alongside differing enhancer architectures make it 
difficult to determine their impact on gene activity. By systematically 
annotating multiple mouse tissues with super- and typical-enhancers, we have 
explored their relationship with gene function and phenotype.
RESULTS: Though super-enhancers drive high total- and tissue-specific expression 
of their associated genes, we find that typical-enhancers also contribute 
heavily to the tissue-specific expression landscape on account of their large 
numbers in the genome. Unexpectedly, we demonstrate that both enhancer types are 
preferentially associated with relevant 'tissue-type' phenotypes and exhibit no 
difference in phenotype effect size or pleiotropy. Modelling regulatory data 
alongside molecular data, we built a predictive model to infer gene-phenotype 
associations and use this model to predict potentially novel disease-associated 
genes.
CONCLUSION: Overall our findings reveal that differing enhancer architectures 
have a similar impact on mammalian phenotypes whilst harbouring differing 
cellular and expression effects. Together, our results systematically 
characterise enhancers with predicted phenotypic traits endorsing the role for 
both types of enhancers in human disease and disorders.

Agranulocytosis is a rare yet severe idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction to 
metamizole, an analgesic widely used in countries such as Switzerland and 
Germany. Notably, an underlying mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated and 
no predictive factors are known to identify at-risk patients. With the aim to 
identify genetic susceptibility variants to metamizole-induced agranulocytosis 
(MIA) and neutropenia (MIN), we conducted a retrospective multi-center 
collaboration including cases and controls from three European populations. 
Association analyses were performed using genome-wide genotyping data from a 
Swiss cohort (45 cases, 191 controls) followed by replication in two independent 
European cohorts (41 cases, 273 controls) and a joint discovery meta-analysis. 
No genome-wide significant associations (p < 1 × 10-7) were observed in the 
Swiss cohort or in the joint meta-analysis, and no candidate genes suggesting an 
immune-mediated mechanism were identified. In the joint meta-analysis of MIA 
cases across all cohorts, two candidate loci on chromosome 9 were identified, 
rs55898176 (OR = 4.01, 95%CI: 2.41-6.68, p = 1.01 × 10-7) and rs4427239 (OR = 
5.47, 95%CI: 2.81-10.65, p = 5.75 × 10-7), of which the latter is located in the 
SVEP1 gene previously implicated in hematopoiesis. This first genome-wide 
association study for MIA identified suggestive associations with biological 
plausibility that may be used as a stepping-stone for post-GWAS analyses to gain 
further insight into the mechanism underlying MIA.

GTPase of immunity-associated proteins (GIMAPs) are frequently prescribed as 
important components of immune regulation complexes, which were known to play 
key roles in lung adenocarcinoma. However, little is known about the function of 
distinct GIMAPs in lung adenocarcinoma. To address this issue, this study 
investigated the biological function and pathway of GIMAPs in lung 
adenocarcinoma using multiple public databases. Absent expression of GIMAPs was 
found in lung adenocarcinoma at mRNA and protein levels. While a 
purity-corrected value uncovered that all GIMAPs were positively associated with 
the immune infiltration of lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the expressions of 
GIMAPs were considered to be negatively associated with clinical cancer stages, 
patient's gender and pathological tumor grades in patients with lung 
adenocarcinoma. Besides, higher mRNA expression of GIMAPs was significantly 
associated with longer overall survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. 
Taken together, these results may enable GIMAPs family members as diagnostic and 
survival biomarker candidates or even potential therapeutic targets for patients 
with lung adenocarcinoma.

Sarcomas are a group of malignant neoplasms of connective tissue with a 
different etiology than carcinomas. The efforts to discover new drugs with 
antisarcoma activity have generated large datasets of multiple preclinical 
assays with different experimental conditions. For instance, the ChEMBL database 
contains outcomes of 37,919 different antisarcoma assays with 34,955 different 
chemical compounds. Furthermore, the experimental conditions reported in this 
dataset include 157 types of biological activity parameters, 36 drug targets, 43 
cell lines, and 17 assay organisms. Considering this information, we propose 
combining perturbation theory (PT) principles with machine learning (ML) to 
develop a PTML model to predict antisarcoma compounds. PTML models use one 
function of reference that measures the probability of a drug being active under 
certain conditions (protein, cell line, organism, etc.). In this paper, we used 
a linear discriminant analysis and neural network to train and compare PT and 
non-PT models. All the explored models have an accuracy of 89.19-95.25% for 
training and 89.22-95.46% in validation sets. PTML-based strategies have similar 
accuracy but generate simplest models. Therefore, they may become a versatile 
tool for predicting antisarcoma compounds.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder 
characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic 
ovaries. Epidemiological findings revealed that women with PCOS are prone to 
develop certain cancer types due to their shared metabolic and endocrine 
abnormalities. However, the mechanism that relates PCOS and oncogenesis has not 
been addressed. Herein, in this review article the genomic status, 
transcriptional and protein profiles of 264 strongly PCOS related genes (PRG) 
were evaluated in endometrial cancer (EC), ovarian cancer (OV) and breast cancer 
(BC) exploring oncogenic databases. The genomic alterations of PRG were 
significantly higher when compared with a set of non-diseases genes in all 
cancer types. PTEN had the highest number of mutations in EC, TP53, in OC, and 
FSHR, in BC. Based on clinical data, women older than 50 years and Black or 
African American females carried the highest ratio of genomic alterations among 
all cancer types. The most altered signaling pathways were p53 in EC and OC, 
while Fc epsilon RI in BC. After evaluating PRG in normal and cancer tissue, 
downregulation of the differentially expressed genes was a common feature. Less 
than 30 proteins were up and downregulated in all cancer contexts. We identified 
36 highly altered genes, among them 10 were shared between the three cancer 
types analyzed, which are involved in the cell proliferation regulation, 
response to hormone and to endogenous stimulus. Despite limited PCOS 
pharmacogenomics studies, 10 SNPs are reported to be associated with drug 
response. All were missense mutations, except for rs8111699, an intronic variant 
characterized as a regulatory element and presumably binding site for 
transcription factors. In conclusion, in silico analysis revealed key genes that 
might participate in PCOS and oncogenesis, which could aid in early cancer 
diagnosis. Pharmacogenomics efforts have implicated SNPs in drug response, yet 
still remain to be found.

Incorrect drug target identification is a major obstacle in drug discovery. Only 
15% of drugs advance from Phase II to approval, with ineffective targets 
accounting for over 50% of these failures1-3. Advances in data fusion and 
computational modeling have independently progressed towards addressing this 
issue. Here, we capitalize on both these approaches with Rosalind, a 
comprehensive gene prioritization method that combines heterogeneous knowledge 
graph construction with relational inference via tensor factorization to 
accurately predict disease-gene links. Rosalind demonstrates an increase in 
performance of 18%-50% over five comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. On 
historical data, Rosalind prospectively identifies 1 in 4 therapeutic 
relationships eventually proven true. Beyond efficacy, Rosalind is able to 
accurately predict clinical trial successes (75% recall at rank 200) and 
distinguish likely failures (74% recall at rank 200). Lastly, Rosalind 
predictions were experimentally tested in a patient-derived in-vitro assay for 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which yielded 5 promising genes, one of which is 
unexplored in RA.

The "antidepressant efficacy" survey (AES) was deployed to > 50,000 23andMe, 
Inc. research participants to investigate the genetic basis of 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-treatment-resistant depression 
(NTRD). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed, including TRD vs. 
NTRD, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) responders vs. 
non-responders, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) responders 
vs. non-responders, and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor responders 
vs. non-responders. Only the SSRI association reached the genome-wide 
significance threshold (p < 5 × 10-8): one genomic region in RNF219-AS1 (SNP 
rs4884091, p = 2.42 × 10-8, OR = 1.21); this association was also observed in 
the meta-analysis (13,130 responders vs. 6,610 non-responders) of AES and an 
earlier "antidepressant efficacy and side effects" survey (AESES) cohort. 
Meta-analysis for SNRI response phenotype derived from AES and AESES (4030 
responders vs. 3049 non-responders) identified another genomic region (lead SNP 
rs4955665, p = 1.62 × 10-9, OR = 1.25) in an intronic region of MECOM passing 
the genome-wide significance threshold. Meta-analysis for the TRD phenotype 
(31,068 NTRD vs 5,714 TRD) identified one additional genomic region (lead SNP 
rs150245813, p = 8.07 × 10-9, OR = 0.80) in 10p11.1 passing the genome-wide 
significance threshold. A stronger association for rs150245813 was observed in 
current study (p = 7.35 × 10-7, OR = 0.79) than the previous study 
(p = 1.40 × 10-3, OR = 0.81), and for rs4955665, a stronger association in 
previous study (p = 1.21 × 10-6, OR = 1.27) than the current study 
(p = 2.64 × 10-4, OR = 1.21). In total, three novel loci associated with SSRI or 
SNRI (responders vs. non-responders), and NTRD vs TRD were identified; gene 
level association and gene set enrichment analyses implicate enrichment of genes 
involved in immune process.

RATIONALE: Although vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is commonly associated with 
high morbidity and high recurrence rate, effective diagnostic and prognostic 
biomarkers of VO are still lacking.
PATIENTS CONCERNS: Case 1: a 60-year-old male had had upper back pain for 3 
days. Case 2: a 71-year-old female presented upper back pain for 2 days.
DIAGNOSES: Based on physical examination and findings of magnetic resonance 
imaging and findings by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of 
flight mass spectrometry, they were diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus VO.
INTERVENTIONS: Using Sengenics Immunome Protein Array by analyzing 
autoantibodies in both VO patients, potential biomarkers of VO were explored.
OUTCOMES: Four subjects with more than 1600 antigens screened while the results 
showed that 14-3-3 protein gamma, pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase, 
fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, and keratin type II cytoskeletal 8 were highly 
differentially expressed among VO and controls. Relevant auto-antibody profiles 
were discovered after intra-group and inter-group comparison, and based on 
functional rationality, an adapter protein 14-3-3 protein gamma, and 
pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase that involved in tetrahydrobiopterin 
biosynthesis, might serve as valuable diagnostic biomarkers.
LESSONS: This pilot study on 4 subjects with more than 1600 antigens screened on 
the Sengenics Immunome protein array provided a general outlook on autoantibody 
biomarker profiles of VO subjects. Future large-scale trials with longer 
follow-up times are warranted.

Hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are often unpredictable and can be life 
threatening, underscoring a need for understanding their underlying mechanisms 
and risk factors. The extent to which germline genetic variation influences the 
risk of commonly reported drug allergies such as penicillin allergy remains 
largely unknown. We extracted data from the electronic health records of more 
than 600,000 participants from the UK, Estonian, and Vanderbilt University 
Medical Center's BioVU biobanks to study the role of genetic variation in the 
occurrence of self-reported penicillin hypersensitivity reactions. We used 
imputed SNP to HLA typing data from these cohorts to further fine map the human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) association and replicated our results in 23andMe's 
research cohort involving a total of 1.12 million individuals. Genome-wide 
meta-analysis of penicillin allergy revealed two loci, including one located in 
the HLA region on chromosome 6. This signal was further fine-mapped to the 
HLA-B∗55:01 allele (OR 1.41 95% CI 1.33-1.49, p value 2.04 × 10-31) and 
confirmed by independent replication in 23andMe's research cohort (OR 1.30 95% 
CI 1.25-1.34, p value 1.00 × 10-47). The lead SNP was also associated with lower 
lymphocyte counts and in silico follow-up suggests a potential effect on 
T-lymphocytes at HLA-B∗55:01. We also observed a significant hit in PTPN22 and 
the GWAS results correlated with the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis and 
psoriasis. We present robust evidence for the role of an allele of the major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) I gene HLA-B in the occurrence of penicillin 
allergy.

BACKGROUND Achyranthes bidentata is a Chinese traditional herbal medicine widely 
used to treat osteoarthritis (OA). This study aimed to identify active compounds 
from Achyranthes bidentata through systematic pharmacology and in vitro 
experiments to find the targets of Achyranthes bidentata in the treatment of OA. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS We screened the active compounds of Achyranthes bidentata 
from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. 
Then, we used STITCH and Open Targets Platform databases to screen the active 
components and predict the potential targets of Achyranthes bidentata in the 
treatment of OA. Subsequently, we studied the compound-target network and 
protein interaction network and analyzed the enrichment of potential target 
proteins. Finally, we used Western blot analysis to verify the therapeutic 
effect of Achyranthes bidentata extract on the expression of OA-related target 
proteins. RESULTS There were 7 active components in Achyranthes bidentata, which 
were strongly related to the 74 targets of OA. Quercetin, baicalein, and 
berberine are the critical active compounds of Achyranthes bidentata in the 
treatment of OA. Protein interaction analysis and in vitro experiments suggested 
that TNF, IL-6, and TP53 are the critical targets of Achyranthes bidentata in 
the treatment of OA. Functional enrichment analysis showed that Achyranthes 
bidentata plays a pharmacological role in OA through apoptosis, inflammation, 
and immune regulation. CONCLUSIONS Quercetin, baicalein, and berberine are the 
critical active compounds of Achyranthes bidentata in the treatment of OA. TNF, 
IL-6, and TP53 may be potential targets for the treatment of OA.

Multiomics dissection of molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying 
autoimmune-associated noncoding SNPs.

Chen XF, Guo MR, Duan YY, Jiang F, Wu H, Dong SS, Zhou XR, Thynn HN, Liu CC, 
Zhang L, Guo Y, Yang TL.

More than 90% of autoimmune-associated variants are located in noncoding 
regions, leading to challenges in deciphering the underlying causal roles of 
functional variants and genes and biological mechanisms. Therefore, to reduce 
the gap between traditional genetic findings and mechanistic understanding of 
disease etiologies and clinical drug development, it is important to translate 
systematically the regulatory mechanisms underlying noncoding variants. Here, we 
prioritized functional noncoding SNPs with regulatory gene targets associated 
with 19 autoimmune diseases by incorporating hundreds of immune cell-specific 
multiomics data. The prioritized SNPs are associated with transcription factor 
(TF) binding, histone modification, or chromatin accessibility, indicating their 
allele-specific regulatory roles. Their target genes are significantly enriched 
in immunologically related pathways and other known immunologically related 
functions. We found that 90.1% of target genes are regulated by distal SNPs 
involving several TFs (e.g., the DNA-binding protein CCCTC-binding factor 
[CTCF]), suggesting the importance of long-range chromatin interaction in 
autoimmune diseases. Moreover, we predicted potential drug targets for 
autoimmune diseases, including 2 genes (NFKB1 and SH2B3) with known drug 
indications on other diseases, highlighting their potential drug repurposing 
opportunities. Taken together, these findings may provide useful information for 
future experimental follow-up and drug applications on autoimmune diseases.

When trying to identify new potential therapeutic protein targets, access to 
data and knowledge is increasingly important. In a field where new resources and 
data sources become available every day, it is crucial to be able to take a step 
back and look at the wider picture in order to identify potential drug targets. 
While this task is routinely performed by bespoke literature searches, it is 
often time-consuming and lacks uniformity when comparing multiple targets at one 
time. To address this challenge, we developed TargetDB, a tool that aggregates 
public information available on given target(s) (links to disease, safety, 3D 
structures, ligandability, novelty, etc.) and assembles it in an easy to read 
output ready for the researcher to analyze. In addition, we developed a target 
scoring system based on the desirable attributes of good therapeutic targets and 
machine learning classification system to categorize novel targets as having 
promising or challenging tractrability. In this manuscript, we present the 
methodology used to develop TargetDB as well as test cases.

Small molecules are usually compared by their chemical structure, but there is 
no unified analytic framework for representing and comparing their biological 
activity. We present the Chemical Checker (CC), which provides processed, 
harmonized and integrated bioactivity data on ~800,000 small molecules. The CC 
divides data into five levels of increasing complexity, from the chemical 
properties of compounds to their clinical outcomes. In between, it includes 
targets, off-targets, networks and cell-level information, such as omics data, 
growth inhibition and morphology. Bioactivity data are expressed in a vector 
format, extending the concept of chemical similarity to similarity between 
bioactivity signatures. We show how CC signatures can aid drug discovery tasks, 
including target identification and library characterization. We also 
demonstrate the discovery of compounds that reverse and mimic biological 
signatures of disease models and genetic perturbations in cases that could not 
be addressed using chemical information alone. Overall, the CC signatures 
facilitate the conversion of bioactivity data to a format that is readily 
amenable to machine learning methods.

Drug development (target identification, advancing drug leads to candidates for 
preclinical and clinical studies) can be facilitated by genetic and genomic 
knowledge. Here, we review the contribution of population genomics to target 
identification, the value of bulk and single cell gene expression analysis for 
understanding the biological relevance of a drug target, and genome-wide CRISPR 
editing for the prioritization of drug targets. In genomics, we discuss the 
different scope of genome-wide association studies using genotyping arrays, 
versus exome and whole genome sequencing. In transcriptomics, we discuss the 
information from drug perturbation and the selection of biomarkers. For CRISPR 
screens, we discuss target discovery, mechanism of action and the concept of 
gene to drug mapping. Harnessing genetic support increases the probability of 
drug developability and approval.

SUMMARY: Estimating efficacy of gene-target-disease associations is a 
fundamental step in drug discovery. An important data source for this laborious 
task is RNA expression, which can provide gene-disease associations on the basis 
of expression fold change and statistical significance. However, the simply use 
of the log-fold change can lead to numerous false-positive associations. On the 
other hand, more sophisticated methods that utilize gene co-expression networks 
do not consider tissue specificity. Here, we introduce Transcriptome-driven 
Efficacy estimates for gene-based TArget discovery (ThETA), an R package that 
enables non-expert users to use novel efficacy scoring methods for drug-target 
discovery. In particular, ThETA allows users to search for gene perturbation 
(therapeutics) that reverse disease-gene expression and genes that are closely 
related to disease-genes in tissue-specific networks. ThETA also provides 
functions to integrate efficacy evaluations obtained with different approaches 
and to build an overall efficacy score, which can be used to identify and 
prioritize gene(target)-disease associations. Finally, ThETA implements 
visualizations to show tissue-specific interconnections between target and 
disease-genes, and to indicate biological annotations associated with the top 
selected genes.

In the last decade, machine learning and artificial intelligence applications 
have received a significant boost in performance and attention in both academic 
research and industry. The success behind most of the recent state-of-the-art 
methods can be attributed to the latest developments in deep learning. When 
applied to various scientific domains that are concerned with the processing of 
non-tabular data, for example, image or text, deep learning has been shown to 
outperform not only conventional machine learning but also highly specialized 
tools developed by domain experts. This review aims to summarize AI-based 
research for GPCR bioactive ligand discovery with a particular focus on the most 
recent achievements and research trends. To make this article accessible to a 
broad audience of computational scientists, we provide instructive explanations 
of the underlying methodology, including overviews of the most commonly used 
deep learning architectures and feature representations of molecular data. We 
highlight the latest AI-based research that has led to the successful discovery 
of GPCR bioactive ligands. However, an equal focus of this review is on the 
discussion of machine learning-based technology that has been applied to ligand 
discovery in general and has the potential to pave the way for successful GPCR 
bioactive ligand discovery in the future. This review concludes with a brief 
outlook highlighting the recent research trends in deep learning, such as active 
learning and semi-supervised learning, which have great potential for advancing 
bioactive ligand discovery.

Treatment of patients with the rare disease eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (EGPA) with mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5 
(IL-5) that reduces blood eosinophil counts, as an add-on therapy to 
glucocorticoid treatment, results in more accrued weeks in remission, reductions 
in glucocorticoid use and reductions in relapse rate. However, treatment 
response varies across a continuum. Therefore, to investigate if large genetic 
effects could identify responders, the impact of genetic variants on efficacy in 
EGPA subjects taking mepolizumab and glucocorticoids was assessed in this post 
hoc study. Using linear regression and a negative binomial model, genetic 
variant association with three endpoints (accrued duration of remission, average 
oral glucocorticoid dose, and frequency of relapse) was tested in 61 EGPA 
subjects dosed with mepolizumab from MIRRA, a phase 3 trial. Candidate gene and 
genome-wide approaches were used. The candidate gene analysis was designed to 
investigate drug target effects with eight gene regions selected that were 
focused on the intersection of the glucocorticoid response (steroidal response) 
and IL-5 response mechanisms and recognizing potential overlap between EGPA and 
severe eosinophilic asthma diseases for which mepolizumab is used. The sample 
size was insufficient to enable testing of rare variants for effects. No genetic 
variant from either the candidate gene analysis or the GWAS associated with any 
endpoint. Thresholds to declare significance were p < 0.0008 (candidate variant) 
and p < 2.5 × 10-8 (genome-wide) analyses. Large genetic effects on 
mepolizumab-treatment response were not identified which could help 
differentiate responders from non-responders.

BACKGROUND: Covid-19 morbidity and mortality are associated with a dysregulated 
immune response. Tools are needed to enhance existing immune profiling 
capabilities in affected patients. Here we aimed to develop an approach to 
support the design of targeted blood transcriptome panels for profiling the 
immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: We designed a pool of candidates based on a pre-existing and 
well-characterized repertoire of blood transcriptional modules. Available 
Covid-19 blood transcriptome data was also used to guide this process. Further 
selection steps relied on expert curation. Additionally, we developed several 
custom web applications to support the evaluation of candidates.
RESULTS: As a proof of principle, we designed three targeted blood transcript 
panels, each with a different translational connotation: immunological 
relevance, therapeutic development relevance and SARS biology relevance.
CONCLUSION: Altogether the work presented here may contribute to the future 
expansion of immune profiling capabilities via targeted profiling of blood 
transcript abundance in Covid-19 patients.

Even with substantial advances in cardiovascular therapy, the morbidity and 
mortality rates of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) continually increase. Hence, a 
feasible therapeutic approach is urgently needed. Objectives. This work is aimed 
at systemically reviewing literature and addressing cell targets in DCM through 
the possible cardioprotection of G. lucidum through its antioxidant effects by 
using the Open Targets Platform (OTP) website. Methods. The OTP website version 
of 19.11 was accessed in December 2019 to identify the studies in DCM involving 
G. lucidum. Results. Among the 157 cell targets associated with DCM, the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was shared by all evidence, drug, and text 
mining data with 0.08 score association. mTOR also had the highest score 
association 0.1 with autophagy in DCM. Among the 1731 studies of indexed PubMed 
articles on G. lucidum published between 1985 and 2019, 33 addressed the 
antioxidant effects of G. lucidum and its molecular signal pathways involving 
oxidative stress and therefore were included in the current work. Conclusion. 
mTOR is one of the targets by DCM and can be inhibited by the antioxidative 
properties of G. lucidum directly via scavenging radicals and indirectly via 
modulating mTOR signal pathways such as Wnt signaling pathway, Erk1/2 signaling, 
and NF-κB pathways.

Large-scale, unbiased proteomics studies are constrained by the complexity of 
the plasma proteome. Here we report a highly parallel protein quantitation 
platform integrating nanoparticle (NP) protein coronas with liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry for efficient proteomic profiling. A protein 
corona is a protein layer adsorbed onto NPs upon contact with biofluids. Varying 
the physicochemical properties of engineered NPs translates to distinct protein 
corona patterns enabling differential and reproducible interrogation of 
biological samples, including deep sampling of the plasma proteome. Spike 
experiments confirm a linear signal response. The median coefficient of 
variation was 22%. We screened 43 NPs and selected a panel of 5, which detect 
more than 2,000 proteins from 141 plasma samples using a 96-well automated 
workflow in a pilot non-small cell lung cancer classification study. Our 
streamlined workflow combines depth of coverage and throughput with precise 
quantification based on unique interactions between proteins and NPs engineered 
for deep and scalable quantitative proteomic studies.

We introduce Proteome-Wide Association Study (PWAS), a new method for detecting 
gene-phenotype associations mediated by protein function alterations. PWAS 
aggregates the signal of all variants jointly affecting a protein-coding gene 
and assesses their overall impact on the protein's function using machine 
learning and probabilistic models. Subsequently, it tests whether the gene 
exhibits functional variability between individuals that correlates with the 
phenotype of interest. PWAS can capture complex modes of heritability, including 
recessive inheritance. A comparison with GWAS and other existing methods proves 
its capacity to recover causal protein-coding genes and highlight new 
associations. PWAS is available as a command-line tool.

As a discipline that deals with many aspects of data, statistics is a critical 
pillar in the rapidly evolving landscape of data science. The increasingly vital 
role of data, especially big data, in many applications, presents the field of 
statistics with unparalleled challenges and exciting opportunities. Statistics 
plays a pivotal role in data science by assisting with the use of data and 
decision making in the face of uncertainty. In this article, we present ten 
research areas that could make statistics and data science more impactful on 
science and society. Focusing on these areas will help better transform data 
into knowledge, actionable insights and deliverables, and promote more 
collaboration with computer and other quantitative scientists and domain 
scientists.

A major cause of failed drug discovery programs is suboptimal target selection, 
resulting in the development of drug candidates that are potent inhibitors, but 
ineffective at treating the disease. In the genomics era, the availability of 
large biomedical datasets with genome-wide readouts has the potential to 
transform target selection and validation. In this study we investigate how 
computational intelligence methods can be applied to predict novel therapeutic 
targets in oncology. We compared different machine learning classifiers applied 
to the task of drug target classification for nine different human cancer types. 
For each cancer type, a set of "known" target genes was obtained and 
equally-sized sets of "non-targets" were sampled multiple times from the human 
protein-coding genes. Models were trained on mutation, gene expression (TCGA), 
and gene essentiality (DepMap) data. In addition, we generated a numerical 
embedding of the interaction network of protein-coding genes using deep network 
representation learning and included the results in the modeling. We assessed 
feature importance using a random forests classifier and performed feature 
selection based on measuring permutation importance against a null distribution. 
Our best models achieved good generalization performance based on the AUROC 
metric. With the best model for each cancer type, we ran predictions on more 
than 15,000 protein-coding genes to identify potential novel targets. Our 
results indicate that this approach may be useful to inform early stages of the 
drug discovery pipeline.

Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play critical roles in many critical biological 
processes and have become a novel class of potential targets and bio-markers for 
disease diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. Annotating and analysing 
ncRNA-disease association data are essential but challenging. Current 
computational resources lack comprehensive database platforms to consistently 
interpret and prioritize ncRNA-disease association data for biomedical 
investigation and application. Here, we present the ncRPheno database platform 
(http://lilab2.sysu.edu.cn/ncrpheno), which comprehensively integrates and 
annotates ncRNA-disease association data and provides novel searches, 
visualizations, and utilities for association identification and validation. 
ncRPheno contains 482,751 non-redundant associations between 14,494 ncRNAs and 
3,210 disease phenotypes across 11 species with supporting evidence in the 
literature. A scoring model was refined to prioritize the associations based on 
evidential metrics. Moreover, ncRPheno provides user-friendly web interfaces, 
novel visualizations, and programmatic access to enable easy exploration, 
analysis, and utilization of the association data. A case study through ncRPheno 
demonstrated a comprehensive landscape of ncRNAs dysregulation associated with 
22 cancers and uncovered 821 cancer-associated common ncRNAs. As a unique 
database platform, ncRPheno outperforms the existing similar databases in terms 
of data coverage and utilities, and it will assist studies in encoding ncRNAs 
associated with phenotypes ranging from genetic disorders to complex diseases.

Astrocytomas are primary human brain tumors including diffuse or anaplastic 
astrocytomas that develop towards secondary glioblastomas over time. However, 
only little is known about molecular alterations that drive this progression. We 
measured multi-omics profiles of patient-matched astrocytoma pairs of initial 
and recurrent tumors from 22 patients to identify molecular alterations 
associated with tumor progression. Gene copy number profiles formed three major 
subcluters, but more than half of the patient-matched astrocytoma pairs differed 
in their gene copy number profiles like astrocytomas from different patients. 
Chromosome 10 deletions were not observed for diffuse astrocytomas, but occurred 
in corresponding recurrent tumors. Gene expression profiles formed three other 
major subclusters and patient-matched expression profiles were much more 
heterogeneous than their copy number profiles. Still, recurrent tumors showed a 
strong tendency to switch to the mesenchymal subtype. The direct progression of 
diffuse astrocytomas to secondary glioblastomas showed the largest number of 
transcriptional changes. Astrocytoma progression groups were further 
distinguished by signaling pathway expression signatures affecting cell 
division, interaction and differentiation. As expected, IDH1 was most frequently 
mutated closely followed by TP53, but also MUC4 involved in the regulation of 
apoptosis and proliferation was frequently mutated. Astrocytoma progression 
groups differed in their mutation frequencies of these three genes. Overall, 
patient-matched astrocytomas can differ substantially within and between 
patients, but still molecular signatures associated with the progression to 
secondary glioblastomas exist and should be analyzed for their potential 
clinical relevance in future studies.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic sphingolipid derived by the 
phosphorylation of sphingosine either by sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) or SPHK2. 
Importantly, S1P acts through five different types of G-protein coupled S1P 
receptors (S1PRs) in immune cells to elicit inflammation and other immunological 
processes by enhancing the production of various cytokines, chemokines, and 
growth factors. The airway inflammation in asthma and other respiratory diseases 
is augmented by the activation of immune cells and the induction of T-helper 
cell type 2 (Th2)-associated cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, studying the 
S1P mediated signaling in airway inflammation is crucial to formulate effective 
treatment and management strategies for asthma and other respiratory diseases. 
The central aim of this study is to characterize the molecular targets induced 
through the S1P/S1PR axis and dissect the therapeutic importance of this key 
axis in asthma, airway inflammation, and other related respiratory diseases. To 
achieve this, we have adopted both high throughput next-generation knowledge 
discovery platforms such as SwissTargetPrediction, WebGestalt, Open Targets 
Platform, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, United States) to delineate 
the molecular targets of S1P and further validated the upstream regulators of 
S1P signaling using cutting edge multiple analyte profiling (xMAP) technology 
(Luminex Corporation, United States) to define the importance of S1P signaling 
in asthma and other respiratory diseases in humans.

Cardiovascular diseases are an important group of diseases that seriously affect 
quality of life. Thus, their treatment warrants further study. Heparin-binding 
protein (HBP) is a granulocyte protein derived from neutrophils. When an 
infection occurs, neutrophils release HBP, which can lead to elevated HBP levels 
in the blood. Therefore, HBP family members are said to be important indicators 
of infection. However, basic evidence is still lacking to confirm the possible 
relationship between HBP and cardiovascular diseases. Using bioinformatics 
methods, we investigated the role of the HBP network in normal hearts and hearts 
from patients with cardiovascular disease. First, we used the Open Targets 
database to obtain a list of HBP-encoding mRNAs related to atherosclerosis, 
myocarditis, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia. Then, we 
constructed an HBP gene interaction network map using STRING. Clustering 
coefficients were calculated using Cytoscape, and MCODE was used for subnet 
analysis. Finally, the proposed interstitial network of HBPs was established and 
analyzed by Metascape enrichment analysis of the relevant signaling pathways. 
The aggregation coefficient of the HBP interaction network was higher among 
hearts with the four cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis (0.496), 
myocarditis (0.631), myocardial infarction (0.532), and myocardial ischemia 
(0.551), than in normal hearts. Metascape analysis showed that 
"NABA_MATRISOME_ASSOCIATED" was a typical pathway with the highest p value 
associated with epithelialization in all four diseases. Moreover, a large number 
of important HBPs were identified that may be significant for the treatment of 
these diseases. Therefore, HBPs do have a highly atopic connectivity network in 
cardiovascular diseases, and specific HBPs or signaling pathways may be used as 
targets for the development of new treatments for cardiovascular diseases.

BACKGROUND: Surveying the scientific literature is an important part of early 
drug discovery; and with the ever-increasing amount of biomedical publications 
it is imperative to focus on the most interesting articles. Here we present a 
project that highlights new understanding (e.g. recently discovered modes of 
action) and identifies potential drug targets, via a novel, data-driven text 
mining approach to score type 2 diabetes (T2D) relevance. We focused on 
monitoring trends and jumps in T2D relevance to help us be timely informed of 
important breakthroughs.
METHODS: We extracted over 7 million n-grams from PubMed abstracts and then 
clustered around 240,000 linked to T2D into almost 50,000 T2D relevant 'semantic 
concepts'. To score papers, we weighted the concepts based on co-mentioning with 
core T2D proteins. A protein's T2D relevance was determined by combining the 
scores of the papers mentioning it in the five preceding years. Each week all 
proteins were ranked according to their T2D relevance. Furthermore, the 
historical distribution of changes in rank from one week to the next was used to 
calculate the significance of a change in rank by T2D relevance for each 
protein.
RESULTS: We show that T2D relevant papers, even those not mentioning T2D 
explicitly, were prioritised by relevant semantic concepts. Well known T2D 
proteins were therefore enriched among the top scoring proteins. Our 'high 
jumpers' identified important past developments in the apprehension of how 
certain key proteins relate to T2D, indicating that our method will make us 
aware of future breakthroughs. In summary, this project facilitated keeping up 
with current T2D research by repeatedly providing short lists of potential novel 
targets into our early drug discovery pipeline.

Integrating association evidence across multiple traits can improve the power of 
gene discovery and reveal pleiotropy. Most multi-trait analysis methods focus on 
individual common variants in genome-wide association studies. Here, we 
introduce multi-trait analysis of rare-variant associations (MTAR), a framework 
for joint analysis of association summary statistics between multiple rare 
variants and different traits. MTAR achieves substantial power gain by 
leveraging the genome-wide genetic correlation measure to inform the degree of 
gene-level effect heterogeneity across traits. We apply MTAR to rare-variant 
summary statistics for three lipid traits in the Global Lipids Genetics 
Consortium. 99 genome-wide significant genes were identified in the 
single-trait-based tests, and MTAR increases this to 139. Among the 11 novel 
lipid-associated genes discovered by MTAR, 7 are replicated in an independent UK 
Biobank GWAS analysis. Our study demonstrates that MTAR is substantially more 
powerful than single-trait-based tests and highlights the value of MTAR for 
novel gene discovery.

BACKGROUND: During the last decade, there has been a surge towards computational 
drug repositioning owing to constantly increasing -omics data in the biomedical 
research field. While numerous existing methods focus on the integration of 
heterogeneous data to propose candidate drugs, it is still challenging to 
substantiate their results with mechanistic insights of these candidate drugs. 
Therefore, there is a need for more innovative and efficient methods which can 
enable better integration of data and knowledge for drug repositioning.
RESULTS: Here, we present a customizable workflow (PS4DR) which not only 
integrates high-throughput data such as genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
data and gene expression signatures from disease and drug perturbations but also 
takes pathway knowledge into consideration to predict drug candidates for 
repositioning. We have collected and integrated publicly available GWAS data and 
gene expression signatures for several diseases and hundreds of FDA-approved 
drugs or those under clinical trial in this study. Additionally, different 
pathway databases were used for mechanistic knowledge integration in the 
workflow. Using this systematic consolidation of data and knowledge, the 
workflow computes pathway signatures that assist in the prediction of new 
indications for approved and investigational drugs.
CONCLUSION: We showcase PS4DR with applications demonstrating how this tool can 
be used for repositioning and identifying new drugs as well as proposing drugs 
that can simulate disease dysregulations. We were able to validate our workflow 
by demonstrating its capability to predict FDA-approved drugs for their known

Osteosarcoma is one of the most common types of bone sarcoma with a poor 
prognosis. However, genes involved in the mineral metabolism in the 
microenvironment of the bone affected by osteosarcoma are, to date, largely 
unknown. A public data series (GSE114237) was used to identify differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between osteosarcoma cells adhering to demineralized 
osseous surfaces and mineralized osseous surfaces. Functional enrichment 
analysis of DEGs and hub genes, protein-protein interaction network of DEGs and 
regulatory network (miRNA-mRNA network and transcription factor (TF)-mRNA 
network), survival analysis of hub genes was visualized. The prognostic hub 
genes were considered as candidate genes and their functional predictions were 
analyzed. A total of 207 DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular space and 
thirteen hub genes were mainly enriched in the function of epithelial to 
mesenchymal transition. However, out of these, only one candidate gene was found 
to be suitable as a candidate gene. Besides that, 297 miRNAs and 349 TFs 
interacting with the hub genes were screened. In conclusion, the DEGs, hub 
genes, miRNAs and TFs screened out in this research could contribute to 
comprehend the latent mechanisms in osteosarcoma affected by matrix mineral and 
provide potential research molecular for further study.

Many drugs are promiscuous and bind to multiple targets. On the one hand, these 
targets may be linked to unwanted side effects, but on the other, they may 
achieve a combined desired effect (polypharmacology) or represent multiple 
diseases (drug repositioning). With the growth of 3D structures of drug-target 
complexes, it is today possible to study drug promiscuity at the structural 
level and to screen vast amounts of drug-target interactions to predict side 
effects, polypharmacological potential, and repositioning opportunities. Here, 
we pursue such an approach to identify drugs inactivating B-cells, whose 
dysregulation can function as a driver of autoimmune diseases. Screening over 
500 kinases, we identified 22 candidate targets, whose knock out impeded the 
activation of B-cells. Among these 22 is the gene KDR, whose gene product VEGFR2 
is a prominent cancer target with anti-VEGFR2 drugs on the market for over a 
decade. The main result of this paper is that structure-based drug repositioning 
for the identified kinase targets identified the cancer drug ibrutinib as 
micromolar VEGFR2 inhibitor with a very high therapeutic index in B-cell 
inactivation. These findings prove that ibrutinib is not only acting on the 
Bruton's tyrosine kinase BTK, against which it was designed. Instead, it may be 
a polypharmacological drug, which additionally targets angiogenesis via 
inhibition of VEGFR2. Therefore ibrutinib carries potential to treat other 
VEGFR2 associated disease. Structure-based drug repositioning explains 
ibrutinib's anti VEGFR2 action through the conservation of a specific pattern of 
interactions of the drug with BTK and VEGFR2. Overall, structure-based drug 
repositioning was able to predict these findings at a fraction of the time and 
cost of a conventional screen.

Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease where genomic alterations, protein 
expression deregulation, signaling pathway alterations, hormone disruption, 
ethnicity and environmental determinants are involved. Due to the complexity of 
BC, the prediction of proteins involved in this disease is a trending topic in 
drug design. This work is proposing accurate prediction classifier for BC 
proteins using six sets of protein sequence descriptors and 13 machine-learning 
methods. After using a univariate feature selection for the mix of five 
descriptor families, the best classifier was obtained using multilayer 
perceptron method (artificial neural network) and 300 features. The performance 
of the model is demonstrated by the area under the receiver operating 
characteristics (AUROC) of 0.980 ± 0.0037, and accuracy of 0.936 ± 0.0056 
(3-fold cross-validation). Regarding the prediction of 4,504 cancer-associated 
proteins using this model, the best ranked cancer immunotherapy proteins related 
to BC were RPS27, SUPT4H1, CLPSL2, POLR2K, RPL38, AKT3, CDK3, RPS20, RASL11A and 
UBTD1; the best ranked metastasis driver proteins related to BC were S100A9, 
DDA1, TXN, PRNP, RPS27, S100A14, S100A7, MAPK1, AGR3 and NDUFA13; and the best 
ranked RNA-binding proteins related to BC were S100A9, TXN, RPS27L, RPS27, 
RPS27A, RPL38, MRPL54, PPAN, RPS20 and CSRP1. This powerful model predicts 
several BC-related proteins that should be deeply studied to find new biomarkers 
and better therapeutic targets. Scripts can be downloaded at

Symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in five percent of children 
treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but whether a genetic 
predisposition exists across different ALL treatment regimens has not been well 
studied.
METHODS: We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for 
VTE in consecutively treated children in the Nordic/Baltic acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia 2008 (ALL2008) cohort and the Australian Evaluation of Risk of ALL 
Treatment-Related Side-Effects (ERASE) cohort. A total of 92 cases and 1481 
controls of European ancestry were included.
RESULTS: No SNPs reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10-8) in either 
cohort. Among the top 34 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (p < 1 × 10-6), 
two loci had concordant effects in both cohorts: ALOX15B (rs1804772) (MAF: 1%; p 
= 3.95 × 10-7) that influences arachidonic acid metabolism and thus platelet 
aggregation, and KALRN (rs570684) (MAF: 1%; p = 4.34 × 10-7) that has been 
previously associated with risk of ischemic stroke, atherosclerosis, and 
early-onset coronary artery disease.
CONCLUSION: This represents the largest GWAS meta-analysis conducted to date 
associating SNPs to VTE in children and adolescents treated on childhood ALL 
protocols. Validation of these findings is needed and may then lead to patient 
stratification for VTE preventive interventions. As VTE hemostasis involves 
multiple pathways, a more powerful GWAS is needed to detect combination of 
variants associated with VTE.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), one of the major small non-coding RNA classes, have been 
proposed as regulatory molecules in neurodevelopment and stress response. 
Although alterations in miRNAs profiles have been implicated in several 
psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, the contribution of individual 
miRNAs in brain development and function is still unknown. Recent studies have 
identified miR-19 as a key regulator of brain trajectories, since it drives the 
differentiation of neural stem cells into mature neurons. However, no findings 
are available on how vulnerability factors for these disorders, such as early 
life stress (ELS), can modulate the expression of miR-19 and its target genes. 
To reach our aim, we investigated miR-19 modulation in human hippocampal 
progenitor stem cells (HPCs) treated with cortisol during 3 days of 
proliferation and harvested immediately after the end of the treatment or after 
20 days of differentiation into mature neurons. We also analyzed the long-term 
expression changes of miR-19 and of its validated target genes, involved in 
neurodevelopment and inflammation, in the hippocampus of adult rats exposed or 
not to prenatal stress (PNS). Interestingly, we observed a significant 
downregulation of miR-19 levels both in proliferating (FC = -1.59, p-value = 
0.022 for miR-19a; FC = -1.79, p-value = 0.016 for miR-19b) as well as 
differentiated HPCs (FC = -1.28, p-value = 0.065 for miR-19a; FC = -1.75, 
p-value = 0.047 for miR-19b) treated with cortisol. Similarly, we found a 
long-term decrease of miR-19 levels in the hippocampus of adult PNS rats (FC = 
-1.35, p-value = 0.025 for miR-19a; FC = -1.43, p-value = 0.032 for miR-19b). 
Among all the validated target genes, we observed a significant increase of 
NRCAM (FC = 1.20, p-value = 0.027), IL4R (FC = 1.26, p-value = 0.046), and 
RAPGEF2 (FC = 1.23, p-value = 0.020).We suggest that ELS can cause a long-term 
downregulation of miR-19 levels, which may be responsible of alterations in 
neurodevelopmental pathways and in immune/inflammatory processes, leading to an 
enhanced risk for mental disorders later in life. Intervention strategies 
targeting miR-19 may prevent alterations in these pathways, reducing the 
ELS-related effects.

Psychiatric and neurological disorders (PNDs) affect millions worldwide and only 
a few drugs achieve complete therapeutic success in the treatment of these 
disorders. Due to the high cost of developing novel drugs, drug repositioning 
represents a promising alternative method of treatment. In this manuscript, we 
used a network medicine approach to investigate the molecular characteristics of 
PNDs and identify novel drug candidates for repositioning. Using IBM Watson for 
Drug Discovery, a powerful machine learning text-mining application, we built 
knowledge networks containing connections between PNDs and genes or drugs 
mentioned in the scientific literature published in the past 50 years. This 
approach revealed several drugs that target key PND-related genes, which have 
never been used to treat these disorders to date. We validate our framework by 
detecting drugs that have been undergoing clinical trial for treating some of 
the PNDs, but have no published results in their support. Our data provides 
comprehensive insights into the molecular pathology of PNDs and offers promising 
drug repositioning candidates for follow-up trials.

The human lifespan is a heritable trait, which is intricately linked to the 
development of disorders. Here, we show that genetic associations for the 
parental lifespan are enriched in open chromatin of blood cells. By using blood 
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) derived from 31,684 samples, we 
identified for the lifespan 125 cis- and 559 trans-regulated expressed genes 
(eGenes) enriched in adaptive and innate responses. Analysis of blood 
single-cell expression data showed that eGenes were enriched in dendritic cells 
(DCs) and the modelling of cell ligand-receptor interactions predicted crosstalk 
between DCs and a cluster of monocytes with a signature of cytotoxicity. In 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), we identified 16 blood cis-eGenes 
causally associated with the lifespan. In MR, the majority of cis-eGene-disorder 
association pairs had concordant effects with the lifespan. The present work 
underlined that the lifespan is linked with the immune response and identifies 
eGenes associated with the lifespan and disorders.

Abnormal immune reactivity in patients with beta-thalassemia (beta-thal) major 
can be associated with poor prognosis. Immunome protein-array analysis 
represents a powerful approach to identify novel biomarkers. The Sengenics 
Immunome Protein Array platform was used for high-throughput quantification of 
autoantibodies in 12 serum samples collected from nine beta-thal major patients 
and three non-thalassemia controls, which were run together with two pooled 
normal sera (Sengenics Internal QC samples). To obtain more accurate and 
reliable results, the evaluation of the biological relevance of the shortlisted 
biomarkers was analyzed using an Open Target Platform online database. Elevated 
autoantibodies directed against 23 autoantigens on the immunome array were 
identified and analyzed using a penetrance fold change-based bioinformatics 
method. Understanding the autoantibody proﬁle of beta-thal major patients would 
help to further understand the pathogenesis of the disease. The identified 
autoantigens may serve as potential biomarkers for the prognosis of beta-thal 
major.

INTRODUCTION: Phenotype-driven rare disease gene prioritization relies on high 
quality curated resources containing disease, gene and phenotype annotations. 
However, the effectiveness of gene prioritization tools is constrained by the 
incomplete coverage of rare disease, phenotype and gene annotations in such 
curated resources.
METHODS: We extracted rare disease correlation pairs involving diseases, 
phenotypes and genes from MEDLINE abstracts and used the information propagation 
algorithm GCAS to build an association network. We built a tool called PRIORI-T 
for rare disease gene prioritization that uses this network for phenotype-driven 
rare disease gene prioritization. The quality of disease-gene associations in 
PRIORI-T was compared with resources such as DisGeNET and Open Targets in the 
context of rare diseases. The gene prioritization performance of PRIORI-T was 
evaluated using phenotype descriptions of 230 real-world rare disease clinical 
cases collated from recent publications, as well as compared to other gene 
prioritization tools such as HANRD and Orphamizer.
RESULTS: PRIORI-T contains qualitatively better associations than DisGeNET and 
Open Targets. Furthermore, the causal genes were captured within Top-50 for more 
than 40% of the real-world clinical cases and within Top-300 for more than 72% 
of the cases when PRIORI-T was used for gene prioritization. It outperformed 
other gene prioritization tools such as HANRD and Orphamizer that primarily rely 
on curated resources.
CONCLUSIONS: PRIORI-T exhibited improved gene prioritization performance without 
requiring high quality curated data. Thus, it holds great promise in 
phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare disease studies.

Drug repositioning aims to find new indications for existing drugs in order to 
reduce drug development cost and time. Currently,there are numerous stories of 
successful drug repositioning that have been reported and many repurposed drugs 
are already available on the market. Although drug repositioning is often a 
product of serendipity, repositioning opportunities can be uncovered 
systematically. There are three systematic approaches to drug repositioning: 
disease-centric approach, target-centric and drug-centric. Disease-centric 
approaches identify close relationships between an old and a new indication. A 
target-centric approach links a known target and its established drug to a new 
indication. Lastly, a drug-centric approach connects a known drug to a new 
target and its associated indication. These three approaches differ in their 
potential and their limitations, but above all else, in the required start 
information and computing power. This raises the question of which approach 
prevails in current drug discovery and what that implies for future 
developments. To address this question, we systematically evaluated over 100 
drugs, 200 target structures and over 300 indications from the Drug 
Repositioning Database. Each analyzed case was classified as one of the three 
repositioning approaches. For the majority of cases (more than 60%) the 
disease-centric definition was assigned. Almost 30% of the cases were classified 
as target-centric and less than 10% as drug-centric approaches. We concluded 
that, despite the use of umbrella term "drug" repositioning, disease- and 
target-centric approaches have dominated the field until now. We propose the use 
of drug-centric approaches while discussing reasons, such as structure-based 
repositioning techniques, to exploit the full potential of drug-target-disease 
connections.

INTRODUCTION: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is genetically and 
clinically heterogeneous. Despite advances in genomic subtyping, standard 
frontline chemoimmunotherapy has remained unchanged for years. As 
high-throughput analysis becomes more accessible, characterizing drug-gene 
interactions in DLBCL could support patient-specific treatment strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From our systematic literature review, we compiled a 
comprehensive list of somatic mutations implicated in DLBCL. We extracted 
reported and primary sequencing data for these mutations and assessed their 
association with signaling pathways, cell-of-origin subtypes, and clinical 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Twenty-two targetable mutations present in ≥ 5% of patients with DLBCL 
were associated with unfavorable outcomes, yielding a predicted population of 
31.7% of DLBCL cases with poor-risk disease and candidacy for targeted therapy. 
A second review identified 256 studies that had characterized the drug-gene 
interactions for these mutations via in vitro studies, mouse models, and/or 
clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel approach linking the data from our systematic reviews 
with informatics tools identified high-risk DLBCL subgroups, DLBCL-specific 
drug-gene interactions, and potential populations for precision medicine trials.

Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women and 
the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Although in recent years 
large-scale efforts have focused on identifying new therapeutic targets, a 
better understanding of BC molecular processes is required. Here we focused on 
elucidating the molecular hallmarks of BC heterogeneity and the oncogenic 
mutations involved in precision medicine that remains poorly defined. To fill 
this gap, we established an OncoOmics strategy that consists of analyzing 
genomic alterations, signaling pathways, protein-protein interactome network, 
protein expression, dependency maps in cell lines and patient-derived xenografts 
in 230 previously prioritized genes to reveal essential genes in breast cancer. 
As results, the OncoOmics BC essential genes were rationally filtered to 140. 
mRNA up-regulation was the most prevalent genomic alteration. The most altered 
signaling pathways were associated with basal-like and Her2-enriched molecular 
subtypes. RAC1, AKT1, CCND1, PIK3CA, ERBB2, CDH1, MAPK14, TP53, MAPK1, SRC, 
RAC3, BCL2, CTNNB1, EGFR, CDK2, GRB2, MED1 and GATA3 were essential genes in at 
least three OncoOmics approaches. Drugs with the highest amount of clinical 
trials in phases 3 and 4 were paclitaxel, docetaxel, trastuzumab, tamoxifen and 
doxorubicin. Lastly, we collected ~3,500 somatic and germline oncogenic variants 
associated with 50 essential genes, which in turn had therapeutic connectivity 
with 73 drugs. In conclusion, the OncoOmics strategy reveals essential genes 
capable of accelerating the development of targeted therapies for precision 
oncology.

Cells in largely non-mitotic tissues such as the brain are prone to stochastic 
(epi-)genetic alterations that may cause increased variability between cells and 
individuals over time. Although increased inter-individual heterogeneity in gene 
expression was previously reported, whether this process starts during 
development or if it is restricted to the aging period has not yet been studied. 
The regulatory dynamics and functional significance of putative aging-related 
heterogeneity are also unknown. Here we address these by a meta-analysis of 19 
transcriptome datasets from three independent studies, covering diverse human 
brain regions. We observed a significant increase in inter-individual 
heterogeneity during aging (20 + years) compared to postnatal development (0 to 
20 years). Increased heterogeneity during aging was consistent among different 
brain regions at the gene level and associated with lifespan regulation and 
neuronal functions. Overall, our results show that increased expression 
heterogeneity is a characteristic of aging human brain, and may influence 
aging-related changes in brain functions.

Pharos is an integrated web-based informatics platform for the analysis of data 
aggregated by the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Knowledge Management 
Center, an NIH Common Fund initiative. The current version of Pharos (as of 
October 2019) spans 20,244 proteins in the human proteome, 19,880 disease and 
phenotype associations, and 226,829 ChEMBL compounds. This resource not only 
collates and analyzes data from over 60 high-quality resources to generate these 
types, but also uses text indexing to find less apparent connections between 
targets, and has recently begun to collaborate with institutions that generate 
data and resources. Proteins are ranked according to a knowledge-based 
classification system, which can help researchers to identify less studied 
"dark" targets that could be potentially further illuminated. This is an 
important process for both drug discovery and target validation, as more 
knowledge can accelerate target identification, and previously understudied 
proteins can serve as novel targets in drug discovery. Two basic protocols 
illustrate the levels of detail available for targets and several methods of 
finding targets of interest. An Alternate Protocol illustrates the difference in 
available knowledge between less and more studied targets. © 2020 by John Wiley

The discovery of novel ligands for orphan GPCRs has profoundly affected our 
understanding of human biology, opening new opportunities for research, and 
ultimately for therapeutic development. Accordingly, much effort has been 
directed towards the remaining orphan receptors, yet the rate of GPCR 
de-orphanisation has slowed in recent years. Here, we briefly review 
contemporary methodologies of de-orphanisation and then highlight our recent 
integrated computational and experimental approach for discovery of novel 
peptide ligands for orphan GPCRs. We identified putative endogenous peptide 
ligands and found peptide receptor sequence and structural characteristics 
present in selected orphan receptors. With comprehensive pharmacological 
screening using three complementary assays, we discovered novel pairings of 17 
peptides with five different orphan GPCRs and revealed potential additional 
ligands for nine peptide GPCRs. These promising findings lay the foundation for 
future studies on these peptides and receptors to characterise their roles in 
human physiology and disease.

The sensing, integrating, and coordinating features of the eukaryotic cells are 
achieved by the complex ultrastructural arrays and multifarious functions of the 
cytoskeleton, including the microtubule network. Microtubules play crucial roles 
achieved by their decoration with proteins/enzymes as well as by 
posttranslational modifications. This review focuses on the Tubulin 
Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP/p25), a new microtubule associated 
protein, on its "regulatory functions by day and pathological functions at 
night". Physiologically, the moonlighting TPPP/p25 modulates the dynamics and 
stability of the microtubule network by bundling microtubules and enhancing the 
tubulin acetylation due to the inhibition of tubulin deacetylases. The optimal 
endogenous TPPP/p25 level is crucial for its physiological functions, to the 
differentiation of oligodendrocytes, which are the major constituents of the 
myelin sheath. Pathologically, TPPP/p25 forms toxic oligomers/aggregates with 
α-synuclein in neurons and oligodendrocytes in Parkinson's disease and Multiple 
System Atrophy, respectively; and their complex is a potential therapeutic drug 
target. TPPP/p25-derived microtubule hyperacetylation counteracts uncontrolled 
cell division. All these issues reveal the anti-mitotic and α-synuclein 
aggregation-promoting potency of TPPP/p25, consistent with the finding that 
Parkinson's disease patients have reduced risk for certain cancers.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) occurs in ~30% of patients with major 
depressive disorder (MDD) but the genetics of TRD was previously poorly 
investigated. Whole exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping were available 
in 1209 MDD patients after quality control. Antidepressant response was compared 
to non-response to one treatment and non-response to two or more treatments 
(TRD). Differences in the risk of carrying damaging variants were tested. A 
score expressing the burden of variants in genes and pathways was calculated 
weighting each variant for its functional (Eigen) score and frequency. 
Gene-based and pathway-based scores were used to develop predictive models of 
TRD and non-response using gradient boosting in 70% of the sample (training) 
which were tested in the remaining 30% (testing), evaluating also the addition 
of clinical predictors. Independent replication was tested in STAR*D and GENDEP 
using exome array-based data. TRD and non-responders did not show higher risk to 
carry damaging variants compared to responders. Genes/pathways associated with 
TRD included those modulating cell survival and proliferation, 
neurodegeneration, and immune response. Genetic models showed significant 
prediction of TRD vs. response and they were improved by the addition of 
clinical predictors, but they were not significantly better than clinical 
predictors alone. Replication results were driven by clinical factors, except 
for a model developed in subjects treated with serotonergic antidepressants, 
which showed a clear improvement in prediction at the extremes of the genetic 
score distribution in STAR*D. These results suggested relevant biological 
mechanisms implicated in TRD and a new methodological approach to the prediction 
of TRD.

Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Over 
the last decades, several studies have shown that tumor-related genomic 
alterations predict tumor prognosis, drug response, and toxicity. These 
observations have led to the development of several therapies based on 
individual genomic profiles. As part of these approaches, pharmacogenomics 
analyses genomic alterations which may predict an efficient therapeutic 
response. Studying these mutations as biomarkers for predicting drug response is 
of a great interest to improve precision medicine. We conduct a comprehensive 
review of the main pharmacogenomics biomarkers and genomic alterations affecting 
enzyme activity, transporter capacity, channels, and receptors; and therefore 
the new advances in CRC precision medicine to select the best therapeutic 
strategy in populations worldwide, with a focus on Latin America.

Alphaviral infections are foremost in causing debilitating clinical outcomes in 
humans characterized by rheumatic arthritis like conditions. Though the presence 
of virus in joints and associated inflammation has been implicated as one of the 
reasons for the acute and chronic polyarthritis post alphaviral infections, the 
basis for rheumatic like outcomes is not clear. Through an in silico analysis, 
we have investigated the possibility of an autoimmune process mediated through 
molecular mimicry in alphaviral infection induced pathogenicity. Interestingly, 
sequence alignment of the structural polyproteins belonging to arthritogenic 
alphaviruses revealed conserved regions which share homology with human proteins 
implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These conserved regions were predicted 
to exhibit binding to HLA class II alleles, showcasing their potential to incite 
T cell help. Molecular docking of the viral peptide and the corresponding 
homologous region in the human protein onto HLA-DRB1 revealed strong 
similarities in their binding patterns. Linear and conformational B cell epitope 
prediction analyses showed that these potential mimics have high propensity to 
elicit an efficient B cell response. We thus propose that the origin of 
polyarthritis post-arthritogenic alphaviral infections may also be mediated 
through a hitherto unknown autoimmune response due to the presence of 
cross-reactive epitopes between viral and human proteins.

Knowledge of therapeutic targets and early drug candidates is useful for 
improved drug discovery. In particular, information about target regulators and 
the patented therapeutic agents facilitates research regarding druggability, 
systems pharmacology, new trends, molecular landscapes, and the development of 
drug discovery tools. To complement other databases, we constructed the 
Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) with expanded information about (i) 
target-regulating microRNAs and transcription factors, (ii) target-interacting 
proteins, and (iii) patented agents and their targets (structures and 
experimental activity values if available), which can be conveniently retrieved 
and is further enriched with regulatory mechanisms or biochemical classes. We 
also updated the TTD with the recently released International Classification of 
Diseases ICD-11 codes and additional sets of successful, clinical trial, and 
literature-reported targets that emerged since the last update. TTD is 
accessible at http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/ttd/ttd.asp. In case of possible web 
connectivity issues, two mirror sites of TTD are also constructed 
(http://db.idrblab.org/ttd/ and http://db.idrblab.net/ttd/).

Expression Atlas is EMBL-EBI's resource for gene and protein expression. It 
sources and compiles data on the abundance and localisation of RNA and proteins 
in various biological systems and contexts and provides open access to this data 
for the research community. With the increased availability of single cell 
RNA-Seq datasets in the public archives, we have now extended Expression Atlas 
with a new added-value service to display gene expression in single cells. 
Single Cell Expression Atlas was launched in 2018 and currently includes 123 
single cell RNA-Seq studies from 12 species. The website can be searched by 
genes within or across species to reveal experiments, tissues and cell types 
where this gene is expressed or under which conditions it is a marker gene. 
Within each study, cells can be visualized using a pre-calculated t-SNE plot and 
can be coloured by different features or by cell clusters based on gene 
expression. Within each experiment, there are links to downloadable files, such 
as RNA quantification matrices, clustering results, reports on protocols and 
associated metadata, such as assigned cell types.

Due to the huge amount of biological and medical data available today, along 
with well-established machine learning algorithms, the design of largely 
automated drug development pipelines can now be envisioned. These pipelines may 
guide, or speed up, drug discovery; provide a better understanding of diseases 
and associated biological phenomena; help planning preclinical wet-lab 
experiments, and even future clinical trials. This automation of the drug 
development process might be key to the current issue of low productivity rate 
that pharmaceutical companies currently face. In this survey, we will 
particularly focus on two classes of methods: sequential learning and 
recommender systems, which are active biomedical fields of research.

As expenditure on drug development increases exponentially, the overall drug 
discovery process requires a sustainable revolution. Since artificial 
intelligence (AI) is leading the fourth industrial revolution, AI can be 
considered as a viable solution for unstable drug research and development. 
Generally, AI is applied to fields with sufficient data such as computer vision 
and natural language processing, but there are many efforts to revolutionize the 
existing drug discovery process by applying AI. This review provides a 
comprehensive, organized summary of the recent research trends in AI-guided drug 
discovery process including target identification, hit identification, ADMET 
prediction, lead optimization, and drug repositioning. The main data sources in 
each field are also summarized in this review. In addition, an in-depth analysis 
of the remaining challenges and limitations will be provided, and proposals for 
promising future directions in each of the aforementioned areas.

BACKGROUND: There are two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, 
pirfenidone and nintedanib, for treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF). However, neither of these drugs provide a cure. In addition, 
both are associated with several drug-related adverse events. Hence, the pursuit 
for newer IPF therapeutics continues. Recent studies show that joint analysis of 
systems-biology-level information with drug-disease connectivity are effective 
in discovery of biologically relevant candidate therapeutics.
METHODS: Publicly available gene expression signatures from patients with IPF 
were used to query a large-scale perturbagen signature library to discover 
compounds that can potentially reverse dysregulated gene expression in IPF. Two 
methods were used to calculate IPF-compound connectivity: gene expression-based 
connectivity and feature-based connectivity. Identified compounds were further 
prioritized if their shared mechanism(s) of action were IPF-related.
RESULTS: We found 77 compounds as potential candidate therapeutics for IPF. Of 
these, 39 compounds are either FDA-approved for other diseases or are currently 
in phase II/III clinical trials suggesting their repurposing potential for IPF. 
Among these compounds are multiple receptor kinase inhibitors (e.g. nintedanib, 
currently approved for IPF, and sunitinib), aurora kinase inhibitor 
(barasertib), epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (erlotinib, 
gefitinib), calcium channel blocker (verapamil), phosphodiesterase inhibitors 
(roflumilast, sildenafil), PPAR agonists (pioglitazone), histone deacetylase 
inhibitors (entinostat), and opioid receptor antagonists (nalbuphine). As a 
proof of concept, we performed in vitro validations with verapamil using lung 
fibroblasts from IPF and show its potential benefits in pulmonary fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: As about half of the candidates discovered in this study are either 
FDA-approved or are currently in clinical trials for other diseases, rapid 
translation of these compounds as potential IPF therapeutics is possible. 
Further, the integrative connectivity analysis framework in this study can be 
adapted in early phase drug discovery for other common and rare diseases with 
transcriptomic profiles.The reviews of this paper are available via the 
supplemental material section.

BACKGROUND: The analysis and interpretation of data generated from 
patient-derived clinical samples relies on access to high-quality bioinformatics 
resources. These are maintained and updated by expert curators extracting 
knowledge from unstructured biological data described in free-text journal 
articles and converting this into more structured, computationally-accessible 
forms. This enables analyses such as functional enrichment of sets of 
genes/proteins using the Gene Ontology, and makes the searching of data more 
productive by managing issues such as gene/protein name synonyms, identifier 
mapping, and data quality.
OBJECTIVE: To undertake a coordinated annotation update of key public-domain 
resources to better support Alzheimer's disease research.
METHODS: We have systematically identified target proteins critical to disease 
process, in part by accessing informed input from the clinical research 
community.
RESULTS: Data from 954 papers have been added to the UniProtKB, Gene Ontology, 
and the International Molecular Exchange Consortium (IMEx) databases, with 299 
human proteins and 279 orthologs updated in UniProtKB. 745 binary interactions 
were added to the IMEx human molecular interaction dataset.
CONCLUSION: This represents a significant enhancement in the expert curated data 
pertinent to Alzheimer's disease available in a number of biomedical databases. 
Relevant protein entries have been updated in UniProtKB and concomitantly in the 
Gene Ontology. Molecular interaction networks have been significantly extended 
in the IMEx Consortium dataset and a set of reference protein complexes created. 
All the resources described are open-source and freely available to the research 
community and we provide examples of how these data could be exploited by 
researchers.

Genetic variation may differentially modify drug and placebo treatment effects 
in randomized clinical trials. In asthma, although lung function and asthma 
control improvements are commonplace with placebo, pharmacogenomics of placebo 
vs. drug response remains unexamined. In a genomewide association study of 
subjective and objective outcomes with placebo treatment in Childhood Asthma 
Management Program of nedocromil/budesonide vs. placebo (N = 604), effect 
estimates for lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared across 
arms. The coughing/wheezing lead SNP, rs2392165 (β = 0.94; P = 1.10E-07) mapped 
to BBS9, a gene implicated in lung development that contains a lung function 
expression quantitative trait locus. The effect was attenuated with budesonide 
(Pinteraction  = 1.48E-07), but not nedocromil (Pinteraction  = 0.06). The lead 
forced vital capacity SNP, rs12930749 (β = -5.80; P = 1.47E-06), mapped to 
KIAA0556, a locus genomewide associated with respiratory diseases. The 
rs12930749 effect was attenuated with budesonide (Pinteraction  = 1.32E-02) and 
nedocromil (Pinteraction  = 1.09E-02). Pharmacogenomic analysis revealed 
differential effects with placebo and drug treatment that could potentially 
guide precision drug development in asthma.

The BIOPEP-UWM™ database of bioactive peptides (formerly BIOPEP) has recently 
become a popular tool in the research on bioactive peptides, especially on these 
derived from foods and being constituents of diets that prevent development of 
chronic diseases. The database is continuously updated and modified. The 
addition of new peptides and the introduction of new information about the 
existing ones (e.g., chemical codes and references to other databases) is in 
progress. New opportunities include the possibility of annotating peptides 
containing D-enantiomers of amino acids, batch processing option, converting 
amino acid sequences into SMILES code, new quantitative parameters 
characterizing the presence of bioactive fragments in protein sequences, and 
finding proteinases that release particular peptides.

The causes of a disease and its therapies are not only related to genotypes, but 
also associated with other factors, including phenotypes, environmental 
exposures, drugs and chemical molecules. Distinguishing disease-related factors 
from many neutral factors is critical as well as difficult. Over the past two 
decades, bioinformaticians have developed many computational resources to 
integrate the omics data and discover associations among these factors. However, 
researchers and clinicians are experiencing difficulties in choosing appropriate 
resources from hundreds of relevant databases and software tools. Here, in order 
to assist the researchers and clinicians, we systematically review the public 
computational resources of human diseases related to genotypes, phenotypes, 
environment factors, drugs and chemical exposures. We briefly describe the 
development history of these computational resources, followed by the details of 
the relevant databases and software tools. We finally conclude with a discussion 
of current challenges and future opportunities as well as prospects on this 
topic.

Misregulation of alternative splicing is a hallmark of human tumors, yet to what 
extent and how it contributes to malignancy are only beginning to be unraveled. 
Here, we define which members of the splicing factor SR and SR-like families 
contribute to breast cancer and uncover differences and redundancies in their 
targets and biological functions. We identify splicing factors frequently 
altered in human breast tumors and assay their oncogenic functions using breast 
organoid models. We demonstrate that not all splicing factors affect mammary 
tumorigenesis in MCF-10A cells. Specifically, the upregulation of SRSF4, SRSF6, 
or TRA2β disrupts acinar morphogenesis and promotes cell proliferation and 
invasion in MCF-10A cells. By characterizing the targets of these oncogenic 
splicing factors, we identify shared spliced isoforms associated with 
well-established cancer hallmarks. Finally, we demonstrate that TRA2β is 
regulated by the MYC oncogene, plays a role in metastasis maintenance in vivo, 
and its levels correlate with breast cancer patient survival.

Metabolic syndrome is a pathological condition characterized by obesity, 
hyperglycemia, hypertension, elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that increase cardiovascular disease risk 
and type 2 diabetes. Although numerous predisposing genetic risk factors have 
been identified, the biological mechanisms underlying this complex phenotype are 
not fully elucidated. Here we introduce a systems biology approach based on 
network analysis to investigate deregulated biological processes and 
subsequently identify drug repurposing candidates. A proximity score describing 
the interaction between drugs and pathways is defined by combining topological 
and functional similarities. The results of this computational framework 
highlight a prominent role of the immune system in metabolic syndrome and 
suggest a potential use of the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib as a novel 
pharmacological treatment. An experimental validation using a high fat 
diet-induced obesity model in zebrafish larvae shows the effectiveness of 
ibrutinib in lowering the inflammatory load due to macrophage accumulation.

Asthma and hypertension are complex diseases coinciding more frequently than 
expected by chance. Unraveling the mechanisms of comorbidity of asthma and 
hypertension is necessary for choosing the most appropriate treatment plan for 
patients with this comorbidity. Since both diseases have a strong genetic 
component in this article we aimed to find and study genes simultaneously 
associated with asthma and hypertension. We identified 330 shared genes and 
found that they form six modules on the interaction network. A strong overlap 
between genes associated with asthma and hypertension was found on the level of 
eQTL regulated genes and between targets of drugs relevant for asthma and 
hypertension. This suggests that the phenomenon of comorbidity of asthma and 
hypertension may be explained by altered genetic regulation or result from drug 
side effects. In this work we also demonstrate that not only drug indications 
but also contraindications provide an important source of molecular evidence 
helpful to uncover disease mechanisms. These findings give a clue to the 
possible mechanisms of comorbidity and highlight the direction for future 
research.

The peptidergic system is the most abundant network of ligand-receptor-mediated 
signaling in humans. However, the physiological roles remain elusive for 
numerous peptides and more than 100 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here we 
report the pairing of cognate peptides and receptors. Integrating comparative 
genomics across 313 species and bioinformatics on all protein sequences and 
structures of human class A GPCRs, we identify universal characteristics that 
uncover additional potential peptidergic signaling systems. Using three 
orthogonal biochemical assays, we pair 17 proposed endogenous ligands with five 
orphan GPCRs that are associated with diseases, including genetic, neoplastic, 
nervous and reproductive system disorders. We also identify additional peptides 
for nine receptors with recognized ligands and pathophysiological roles. This 
integrated computational and multifaceted experimental approach expands the 
peptide-GPCR network and opens the way for studies to elucidate the roles of 
these signaling systems in human physiology and disease. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease that shows one of the highest 
mortality rates among rheumatic diseases. We perform a large genome-wide 
association study (GWAS), and meta-analysis with previous GWASs, in 26,679 
individuals and identify 27 independent genome-wide associated signals, 
including 13 new risk loci. The novel associations nearly double the number 
of genome-wide hits reported for SSc thus far. We define 95% credible sets of 
less than 5 likely causal variants in 12 loci. Additionally, we identify 
specific SSc subtype-associated signals. Functional analysis of high-priority 
variants shows the potential function of SSc signals, with the identification of 
43 robust target genes through HiChIP. Our results point towards molecular 
pathways potentially involved in vasculopathy and fibrosis, two main hallmarks 
in SSc, and highlight the spectrum of critical cell types for the disease. This 
work supports a better understanding of the genetic basis of SSc and provides 
directions for future functional experiments.

SUMMARY: Making use of accumulated genetic knowledge for clinical practice is 
our next goal in human genetics. Here we introduce GREP (Genome for 
REPositioning drugs), a standalone python software to quantify an enrichment of 
the user-defined set of genes in the target of clinical indication categories 
and to capture potentially repositionable drugs targeting the gene set. We show 
that genes identified by the large-scale genome-wide association studies were 
robustly enriched in the approved drugs to treat the trait of interest. This 
enrichment analysis was also highly applicable to other sets of biological genes 
such as those identified by gene expression studies and genes somatically 
mutated in cancers. This software should accelerate investigators to reposition 
drugs to other indications with the guidance of known genomics.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GREP is available at 
https://github.com/saorisakaue/GREP as a python source code.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics 
online.

The keratinocyte cancers (KC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC) are the most common cancers in fair-skinned people. KC treatment 
represents the second highest cancer healthcare expenditure in Australia. 
Increasing our understanding of the genetic architecture of KC may provide new 
avenues for prevention and treatment. We first conducted a series of genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) of KC across three European ancestry datasets from 
Australia, Europe and USA, and used linkage disequilibrium (LD) Score regression 
(LDSC) to estimate their pairwise genetic correlations. We employed a 
multiple-trait approach to map genes across the combined set of KC GWAS (total 
N = 47 742 cases, 634 413 controls). We also performed meta-analyses of BCC and 
SCC separately to identify trait specific loci. We found substantial genetic 
correlations (generally 0.5-1) between BCC and SCC suggesting overlapping 
genetic risk variants. The multiple trait combined KC GWAS identified 63 
independent genome-wide significant loci, 29 of which were novel. Individual 
separate meta-analyses of BCC and SCC identified an additional 13 novel loci not 
found in the combined KC analysis. Three new loci were implicated using 
gene-based tests. New loci included common variants in BRCA2 (distinct to known 
rare high penetrance cancer risk variants), and in CTLA4, a target of 
immunotherapy in melanoma. We found shared and trait specific genetic 
contributions to BCC and SCC. Considering both, we identified a total of 79 
independent risk loci, 45 of which are novel.

Modern high-throughput experiments provide us with numerous potential 
associations between genes and diseases. Experimental validation of all the 
discovered associations, let alone all the possible interactions between them, 
is time-consuming and expensive. To facilitate the discovery of causative genes, 
various approaches for prioritization of genes according to their relevance for 
a given disease have been developed. In this article, we explain the gene 
prioritization problem and provide an overview of computational tools for gene 
prioritization. Among about a hundred of published gene prioritization tools, we 
select and briefly describe 14 most up-to-date and user-friendly. Also, we 
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of existing tools, challenges of their 
validation, and the directions for future research.

In-silico identification of potential target genes for disease is an essential 
aspect of drug target discovery. Recent studies suggest that successful targets 
can be found through by leveraging genetic, genomic and protein interaction 
information. Here, we systematically tested the ability of 12 varied algorithms, 
based on network propagation, to identify genes that have been targeted by any 
drug, on gene-disease data from 22 common non-cancerous diseases in OpenTargets. 
We considered two biological networks, six performance metrics and compared two 
types of input gene-disease association scores. The impact of the design factors 
in performance was quantified through additive explanatory models. Standard 
cross-validation led to over-optimistic performance estimates due to the 
presence of protein complexes. In order to obtain realistic estimates, we 
introduced two novel protein complex-aware cross-validation schemes. When 
seeding biological networks with known drug targets, machine learning and 
diffusion-based methods found around 2-4 true targets within the top 20 
suggestions. Seeding the networks with genes associated to disease by genetics 
decreased performance below 1 true hit on average. The use of a larger network, 
although noisier, improved overall performance. We conclude that diffusion-based 
prioritisers and machine learning applied to diffusion-based features are suited 
for drug discovery in practice and improve over simpler neighbour-voting 
methods. We also demonstrate the large impact of choosing an adequate validation 
strategy and the definition of seed disease genes.

DNA methylation plays an important role in major depressive disorder (MDD), but 
the specific genes and genomic regions associated with MDD remain largely 
unknown. Here we conducted genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation (Infinium 
MethylationEPIC BeadChip) and gene expression (RNA-seq) in peripheral blood 
monocytes from 79 monozygotic twin pairs (mean age 38.2 ± 15.6 years) discordant 
on lifetime history of MDD to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) 
and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with MDD, followed by 
replication in brain tissue samples. Integrative DNA methylome and transcriptome 
analysis and network analysis was performed to identify potential functional 
epigenetic determinants for MDD. We identified 39 DMRs and 30 DEGs associated 
with lifetime history of MDD. Some genes were replicated in postmortem brain 
tissue. Integrative DNA methylome and transcriptome analysis revealed both 
negative and positive correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression, 
but the correlation pattern varies greatly by genomic locations. Network 
analysis revealed distinct gene modules enriched in signaling pathways related 
to stress responses, neuron apoptosis, insulin receptor signaling, mTOR 
signaling, and nerve growth factor receptor signaling, suggesting potential 
functional relevance to MDD. These results demonstrated that altered DNA 
methylation and gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes are associated 
with MDD. Our results highlight the utility of using peripheral blood epigenetic 
markers and demonstrate that a monozygotic discordant co-twin control design can 
aid in the discovery of novel genes associated with MDD. If validated, the newly 
identified genes may serve as novel biomarkers or druggable targets for MDD and 
related disorders.

Breast cancer has become the most common cancer that leads to women's death. 
Breast cancer is a complex, highly heterogeneous disease classified into various 
subtypes based on histological features, which determines the therapeutic 
options. System identification of effective drugs for each subtype remains 
challenging. In this work, we present a computational network biology approach 
to screen precision drugs for different breast cancer subtypes by considering 
the impact intensity of candidate drugs on the pathway crosstalk mediated by 
miRNAs. Firstly, we constructed and analyzed the subtype-specific risk pathway 
crosstalk networks mediated by miRNAs. Then, we evaluated 36 Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved anticancer drugs by quantifying their effects on 
these subtype-specific pathway crosstalk networks and combining with survival 
analysis. Finally, some first-line treatments of breast cancer, such as 
Paclitaxel and Vincristine, were optimized for each subtype. In particular, we 
performed precision screening of subtype-specific therapeutic drugs and also 
confirmed some novel drugs suitable for breast cancer treatment. For example, 
Sorafenib was applicable for the basal subtype treatment, Irinotecan was optimum 
for Her2 subtype treatment, Vemurafenib was suitable for the LumA subtype 
treatment, and Vorinostat could apply to LumB subtype treatment. In addition, 
the mechanism of these optimal therapeutic drugs in each subtype of breast 
cancer was further dissected. In summary, our study offers an effective way to 
screen precision drugs for various breast cancer subtype treatments. We also 
dissected the mechanism of optimal therapeutic drugs, which may provide novel 
insight into the precise treatment of cancer and promote researches on the 
mechanisms of action of drugs.

The increase in the number of both patients and healthcare practitioners who 
grew up using the Internet and computers (so-called "digital natives") is likely 
to impact the practice of precision medicine, and requires novel platforms for 
data integration and mining, as well as contextualized information retrieval. 
The "Illuminating the Druggable Genome Knowledge Management Center" (IDG KMC) 
quantifies data availability from a wide range of chemical, biological, and 
clinical resources, and has developed platforms that can be used to navigate 
understudied proteins (the "dark genome"), and their potential contribution to 
specific pathologies. Using the "Target Importance and Novelty Explorer" (TIN-X) 
highlights the role of LRRC10 (a dark gene) in dilated cardiomyopathy. Combining 
mouse and human phenotype data leads to increased strength of evidence, which is 
discussed for four additional dark genes: SLX4IP and its role in glucose 
metabolism, the role of HSF2BP in coronary artery disease, the involvement of 
ELFN1 in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and the role of VPS13D in 
mouse neural tube development and its confirmed role in childhood onset movement 
disorders. The workflow and tools described here are aimed at guiding further 
experimental research, particularly within the context of precision medicine.

OBJECTIVES: There is a need to identify effective treatments for rheumatic 
diseases, and while genetic studies have been successful it is unclear which 
genes contribute to the disease. Using our existing Capture Hi-C data on three 
rheumatic diseases, we can identify potential causal genes which are targets for 
existing drugs and could be repositioned for use in rheumatic diseases.
METHODS: High confidence candidate causal genes were identified using Capture 
Hi-C data from B cells and T cells. These genes were used to interrogate drug 
target information from DrugBank to identify existing treatments, which could be 
repositioned to treat these diseases. The approach was refined using Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis to identify enriched pathways and therefore further treatments 
relevant to the disease.
RESULTS: Overall, 454 high confidence genes were identified. Of these, 48 were 
drug targets (108 drugs) and 11 were existing therapies used in the treatment of 
rheumatic diseases. After pathway analysis refinement, 50 genes remained, 13 of 
which were drug targets (33 drugs). However considering targets across all 
enriched pathways, a further 367 drugs were identified for potential 
repositioning.
CONCLUSION: Capture Hi-C has the potential to identify therapies which could be 
repositioned to treat rheumatic diseases. This was particularly successful for 
rheumatoid arthritis, where six effective, biologic treatments were identified. 
This approach may therefore yield new ways to treat patients, enhancing their 
quality of life and reducing the economic impact on healthcare providers. As 
additional cell types and other epigenomic data sets are generated, this 
prospect will improve further.

Current opportunities to catalyze research in nutrition and cancer prevention - 
an interdisciplinary perspective.

Cancer Research UK - Ludwig Cancer Research Nutrition and Cancer Prevention 
Collaborative Group.

Cancer Research UK and Ludwig Cancer Research convened an inaugural 
international Cancer Prevention and Nutrition Conference in London on December 
3-4, 2018. Much of the discussion focused on the need for systematic, 
interdisciplinary approaches to better understand the relationships of 
nutrition, exercise, obesity and metabolic dysfunction with cancer development. 
Scientists at the meeting underscored the importance of studying the temporal 
natural history of exposures that may cumulatively impact cancer risk later in 
life.A robust dialogue identified obesity as a major risk for cancer, and the 
food environment, especially high energy and low nutrient processed foods, as 
strong and prevalent risk factors for obesity. Further engagement highlighted 
challenges in the post-diagnostic setting, where similar opportunities to 
understand the complex interplay of nutrition, physical activity, and weight 
will inform better health outcomes.Going forward, holistic research approaches, 
encompassing insights from multiple disciplines and perspectives, will catalyze 
progress urgently needed to prevent cancer and improve public health.

Background: Immunotherapies targeting immune checkpoint proteins CTLA-4, PD-1, 
and PD-L1 have saved lives, but these therapies have only been effective in some 
patients. Patients positive for expression of immune checkpoint proteins in the 
tumor microenvironment show better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
Consequently, knowledge of which genes are consistently expressed in lymphocytes 
within the tumor microenvironment can convey potentially effective and 
complementary new immunotherapy targets. Results: We identified 54 genes that 
have higher co-expression with the pan T-cell marker CD3E than CTLA4 or PDCD1. 
In a dataset of 26 patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy, we observed that 
co-expression between CD3E and PDCD1 was higher among responders than 
non-responders, supporting our correlation-based approach. Conclusions: The 
genes highlighted in these analyses, which include CD6, TIGIT, CD96, and SLAMF6, 
warrant further investigation of their therapeutic potential. Methods: We 
analyzed and ranked genes that were co-expressed with the pan T-cell marker CD3E 
in 9,601 human tumors, spanning 31 cancer types. To further identify targets 
that may be complementary to existing PD-1 therapy, we examined and ranked genes 
with high CD3E co-expression and relatively low PDCD1 co-expression.

Biological target (commonly genes or proteins) identification is still largely a 
manual process, where experts manually try to collect and combine information 
from hundreds of data sources, ranging from scientific publications to omics 
databases. Targeting the wrong gene or protein will lead to failure of the drug 
development process, as well as incur delays and costs. To improve this process, 
different software platforms are being developed. These platforms rely strongly 
on efficacy estimates based on target-disease association scores created by 
computational methods for drug target prioritization. Here novel computational 
methods are presented to more accurately evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
potential drug targets. The proposed efficacy scores utilize existing gene 
expression data and tissue/disease specific networks to improve the inference of 
target-disease associations. Conversely, safety scores enable the identification 
of genes that are essential, potentially susceptible to adverse effects or 
carcinogenic. Benchmark results demonstrate that our transcriptome-based methods 
for drug target prioritization can increase the true positive rate of 
target-disease associations. Additionally, the proposed safety evaluation system 
enables accurate predictions of targets of withdrawn drugs and targets of drug 
trials prematurely discontinued.

The frequency by which genes are studied correlates with the prior knowledge 
accumulated about them. This leads to an imbalance in research attention where 
some genes are highly investigated while others are ignored. Geneshot is a 
search engine developed to illuminate this gap and to promote attention to the 
under-studied genome. Through a simple web interface, Geneshot enables 
researchers to enter arbitrary search terms, to receive ranked lists of genes 
relevant to the search terms. Returned ranked gene lists contain genes that were 
previously published in association with the search terms, as well as genes 
predicted to be associated with the terms based on data integration from 
multiple sources. The search results are presented with interactive 
visualizations. To predict gene function, Geneshot utilizes gene-gene similarity 
matrices from processed RNA-seq data, or from gene-gene co-occurrence data 
obtained from multiple sources. In addition, Geneshot can be used to analyze the 
novelty of gene sets and augment gene sets with additional relevant genes. The 
Geneshot web-server and API are freely and openly available from

Most candidate drugs currently fail later-stage clinical trials, largely due to 
poor prediction of efficacy on early target selection1. Drug targets with 
genetic support are more likely to be therapeutically valid2,3, but the 
translational use of genome-scale data such as from genome-wide association 
studies for drug target discovery in complex diseases remains challenging4-6. 
Here, we show that integration of functional genomic and immune-related 
annotations, together with knowledge of network connectivity, maximizes the 
informativeness of genetics for target validation, defining the target 
prioritization landscape for 30 immune traits at the gene and pathway level. We 
demonstrate how our genetics-led drug target prioritization approach (the 
priority index) successfully identifies current therapeutics, predicts activity 
in high-throughput cellular screens (including L1000, CRISPR, mutagenesis and 
patient-derived cell assays), enables prioritization of under-explored targets 
and allows for determination of target-level trait relationships. The priority 
index is an open-access, scalable system accelerating early-stage drug target 
selection for immune-mediated disease.

Growing evidence suggests that peripheral factors to the brain driving 
neuro-inflammation could affect Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease 
(PD) severity. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection has been associated 
with AD while other related viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), 
Epstein-Bar virus and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), are known to infect neurons. 
Here we compare gene expression profiles between AD or PD patients to those 
afflicted with herpes viral infections as to discover novel potential 
neuro-inflammation pathways. We found multiple significant differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) shared between AD/PD and viral infections including SESN3 
which has a genetic association for increased AD risk. Pathway enrichment 
analysis revealed viruses shared Oxidative Stress Defense System and LRRK2 
pathways with AD and PD, respectively. We further processed our data to identify 
novel target and drug-repurposing opportunities including anti-inflammatory 
therapy, immune-modulators and cholinesterase inhibitors which could lead to new 
therapeutics paradigms for these neurodegenerative diseases.

PURPOSE: Tong Sheng tablets (TSTs) have long been used for treating cerebral 
ischemic reperfusion injury (CIRI) in clinic, but the underlying mechanism 
remains unknown. Therefore, in this study, TSTs were evaluated systematically 
using chemical analysis, network pharmacology and classical pharmacology.
METHODS: The first part was TSTs quality control including TSTs fingerprint 
establishment and chemicals identification. In the second part, network 
pharmacology analysis and bioinformatics were combined to construct a 
compound-target-disease network, which can screen out key targets or pathways, 
revealing complex molecule mechanism of TSTs. The last part was experiment 
verification. Classical pharmacology of TSTs was investigated in vivo to verify 
the results of network pharmacology.
RESULTS: (1) Fingerprints of TSTs were established, and 11 characteristic peaks 
were identified using HPLC. (2) Network pharmacology and bioinformatics 
suggested that the protection of TSTs in treating CIRI might be related to 
regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, and some key 
molecules such as Nrf2, IL-1β, TNF, Bcl-2 and Cyt-C involved in the pathways. 
(3) TSTs significantly improved neurologic behavior scores, decreased the areas 
of ischemic necrosis and neuronal necrosis, and increased Nissl body counts. 
Besides, TSTs significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, TNF-α) 
and pro-oxidative product levels (LPO, MDA) and increased anti-oxidative product 
levels (NO, SOD). TSTs downregulated the protein expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1. 
Meanwhile, TSTs reduced apoptotic cell counts, downregulated the protein 
expressions of Cyt-C and Bax, and upregulated the protein expression of Bcl-2. 
In terms of autophagy, TSTs enhanced LC-3B protein expression.
CONCLUSION: The present results illustrated that TSTs effectively alleviated 
CIRI, and the underlying mechanism might be associated with multiple molecular 
pathways. Herein, we established a primary pattern for studying Chinese herbal 
compounds and provided basic guidance for future investigation.

A plethora of databases exist online that can assist in in silico chemical or 
drug safety assessment. However, a systematic review and grouping of databases, 
based on purpose and information content, consolidated in a single source, has 
been lacking. To resolve this issue, this review provides a comprehensive 
listing of the key in silico data resources relevant to: chemical identity and 
properties, drug action, toxicology (including nano-material toxicity), 
exposure, omics, pathways, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Elimination 
(ADME) properties, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, patents-related 
databases, biological (genes, enzymes, proteins, other macromolecules etc.) 
databases, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), environmental exposure related, 
and finally databases relating to animal alternatives in support of 3Rs 
policies. More than nine hundred databases were identified and reviewed against 
criteria relating to accessibility, data coverage, interoperability or 
application programming interface (API), appropriate identifiers, types of in 
vitro, in vivo,-clinical or other data recorded and suitability for modelling, 
read-across, or similarity searching. This review also specifically addresses 
the need for solutions for mapping and integration of databases into a common 
platform for better translatability of preclinical data to clinical data.

Although the human genome provides the blueprint for life, most of the proteins 
it encodes remain poorly studied. This perspective describes how one group of 
scientists, in seeking new targets for drug discovery, used open science through 
unrestricted sharing of small molecules to shed light on dark matter of the 
genome. Starting initially with a single pharmaceutical company before expanding 
to multiple companies, a precedent was established for sharing published kinase 
inhibitors as chemical tools. The integration of open science and kinase 
chemogenomics has supported the study of many new potential drug targets by the 
scientific community.

Drug discovery and development pipelines are long, complex and depend on 
numerous factors. Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a set of tools that 
can improve discovery and decision making for well-specified questions with 
abundant, high-quality data. Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of 
drug discovery. Examples include target validation, identification of prognostic 
biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical trials. 
Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches 
yielding accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie 
primarily with the lack of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated 
results, which may limit their application. In all areas, systematic and 
comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With ongoing 
efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors 
needed to validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven 
decision making and has the potential to speed up the process and reduce failure 
rates in drug discovery and development.

Identifying the viability of protein targets is one of the preliminary steps of 
drug discovery. Determining the ability of a protein to bind drugs in order to 
modulate its function, termed the druggability, requires a non-trivial amount of 
time and resources. Inability to properly measure druggability has accounted for 
a significant portion of failures in drug discovery. This problem is only 
further exacerbated by the large sample space of proteins involved in human 
diseases. With these barriers, the druggability space within the human proteome 
remains unexplored and has made it difficult to develop drugs for numerous 
diseases. Hence, we present a new feature developed in eFindSite that employs 
supervised machine learning to predict the druggability of a given protein. 
Benchmarking calculations against the Non-Redundant data set of Druggable and 
Less Druggable binding sites demonstrate that an AUC for druggability prediction 
with eFindSite is as high as 0.88. With eFindSite, we elucidated the human 
druggability space to be 10,191 proteins. Considering the disease space from the 
Open Targets Platform and excluding already known targets from the predicted 
data set reveal 2731 potentially novel therapeutic targets. eFindSite is freely 
available as a stand-alone software at 
https://github.com/michal-brylinski/efindsite .

Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) also known as Lynch Syndrome 
(LS), is a hereditary form of colorectal cancer (CRC). LSis caused by mutations 
in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, mostly in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. 
Identification of these gene mutations is essential to diagnose CRC, especially 
at a young age to increase the survival rate. Using open target platform, we 
have performed genetic association studies to analyze the different genes 
involved in the LS and to obtain target for disease evidence. We have also 
analyzed upstream regulators as target molecules in the data sets. We discovered 
that MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MLH3, EPCAM, TGFBR2, FBXO11 and PRSS58 were showing 
most association in LS. Our findings may further enhance the understanding of 
the hereditaryform of CRC.

Microbe induced cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are less studied at present. 
Host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) between human proteins and microbial proteins 
associated with CVD can be found dispersed in existing molecular interaction 
databases. MorCVD database is a curated resource that combines 23,377 protein 
interactions between human host and 432 unique pathogens involved in CVDs in a 
single intuitive web application. It covers endocarditis, myocarditis, 
pericarditis and 16 other microbe induced CVDs. The HPI information has been 
compiled, curated, and presented in a freely accessible web interface ( 
http://morcvd.sblab-nsit.net/About ). Apart from organization, enrichment of the 
HPI data was done by adding hyperlinked protein ID, PubMed, gene ontology 
records. For each protein in the database, drug target and interactors (same as 
well as different species) information has been provided. The database can be 
searched by disease, protein ID, pathogen name or interaction detection method. 
Interactions detected by more than one method can also be listed. The 
information can be presented in tabular form or downloaded. A comprehensive help 
file has been developed to explain the various options available. Hence, MorCVD 
acts as a unified resource for retrieval of HPI data for researchers in CVD and 
microbiology.

OBJECTIVE: Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are heterogeneous and 
complex conditions with overlapping clinical symptoms and elevated familial 
aggregation, which suggests the existence of a shared genetic component. In 
order to identify this genetic background in a systematic fashion, we performed 
the first cross-disease genome-wide meta-analysis in systemic seropositive 
rheumatic diseases, namely, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, 
rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.
METHODS: We meta-analysed ~6.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 11 678 
cases and 19 704 non-affected controls of European descent populations. The 
functional roles of the associated variants were interrogated using publicly 
available databases.
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed five shared genome-wide significant independent 
loci that had not been previously associated with these diseases: NAB1, 
KPNA4-ARL14, DGQK, LIMK1 and PRR12. All of these loci are related with immune 
processes such as interferon and epidermal growth factor signalling, response to 
methotrexate, cytoskeleton dynamics and coagulation cascade. Remarkably, several 
of the associated loci are known key players in autoimmunity, which supports the 
validity of our results. All the associated variants showed significant 
functional enrichment in DNase hypersensitivity sites, chromatin states and 
histone marks in relevant immune cells, including shared expression quantitative 
trait loci. Additionally, our results were significantly enriched in drugs that 
are being tested for the treatment of the diseases under study.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified shared new risk loci with functional value 
across diseases and pinpoint new potential candidate loci that could be further 
investigated. Our results highlight the potential of drug repositioning among 
related systemic seropositive rheumatic IMIDs.

In cystic fibrosis (CF), mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene disrupt the capacity of the encoded protein to 
function as a channel to transport chloride ions and water across cell 
membranes. The consequences are deleterious, system-wide, and immensely 
variable, even among patients with the same CFTR genotype. This underscores the 
need to characterize the mechanisms contributing to CF pathophysiology. Gene 
replacement and gene editing therapies have been pursued intensively and are 
expected to provide a one-time treatment for CF. However, gene replacement 
therapy is limited by the lack of efficient vectors to deliver functional copies 
of CFTR to cells without immunological complications, while gene editing 
technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 are still in their infancy, mainly useful in 
somatic cells and limited by off-target insertions. Small molecule treatments 
targeted at potentiating or correcting CFTR have shown clinical benefits, but 
they are limited to a few CFTR mutations and insufficient to overcome challenges 
related to clinical heterogeneity. Transcriptome profiling approaches have 
emerged as robust tools capable of characterizing phenotypic variability and 
revealing novel molecular targets with therapeutic potential for CF. We 
summarize current insights gained through transcriptome profiling approaches in 
CF studies and recent advances in molecular therapeutics.

Diet is considered to be a significant factor in cancer prevention and therapy. 
Many food components reveal anticancer activity. The increasing number of 
experiments concerning the anticancer potential of chemical compounds, including 
food components, is a challenge for data searching. Specialized databases 
provide an opportunity to overcome this problem. Data concerning the anticancer 
activity of chemical compounds may be found in general databases of chemical 
compounds and databases of drugs, including specialized resources concerning 
anticancer compounds, databases of food components, and databases of individual 
groups of compounds, such as polyphenols or peptides. This brief review 
summarizes the state of knowledge of chemical databases containing information 
concerning natural anticancer compounds (e.g., from food). Additionally, the 
information about text- and structure-based search options and links between 
particular internet resources is provided in this paper. Examples of the 
application of databases in food and nutrition sciences are also presented with 
special attention to compounds that are interesting from the point of view of 
dietary cancer prevention. Simple examples of potential database search 
possibilities are also discussed.

BACKGROUND: Determining which target to pursue is a challenging and error-prone 
first step in developing a therapeutic treatment for a disease, where missteps 
are potentially very costly given the long-time frames and high expenses of drug 
development. With current informatics technology and machine learning 
algorithms, it is now possible to computationally discover therapeutic 
hypotheses by predicting clinically promising drug targets based on the evidence 
associating drug targets with disease indications. We have collected this 
evidence from Open Targets and additional databases that covers 17 sources of 
evidence for target-indication association and represented the data as a tensor 
of 21,437 × 2211 × 17.
RESULTS: As a proof-of-concept, we identified examples of successes and failures 
of target-indication pairs in clinical trials across 875 targets and 574 disease 
indications to build a gold-standard data set of 6140 known clinical outcomes. 
We designed and executed three benchmarking strategies to examine the 
performance of multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, LASSO, 
Random Forest, Tensor Factorization and Gradient Boosting Machine. With 10-fold 
cross-validation, tensor factorization achieved AUROC = 0.82 ± 0.02 and 
AUPRC = 0.71 ± 0.03. Across multiple validation schemes, this was comparable or 
better than other methods.
CONCLUSION: In this work, we benchmarked a machine learning technique called 
tensor factorization for the problem of predicting clinical outcomes of 
therapeutic hypotheses. Results have shown that this method can achieve equal or 
better prediction performance compared with a variety of baseline models. We 
demonstrate one application of the method to predict outcomes of trials on novel 
indications of approved drug targets. This work can be expanded to targets and 
indications that have never been clinically tested and proposing novel 
target-indication hypotheses. Our proposed biologically-motivated 
cross-validation schemes provide insight into the robustness of the prediction 
performance. This has significant implications for all future methods that try 
to address this seminal problem in drug discovery.

Osteoarthritis is the most common musculoskeletal disease and the leading cause 
of disability globally. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study for 
osteoarthritis (77,052 cases and 378,169 controls), analyzing four phenotypes: 
knee osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, knee and/or hip osteoarthritis, and any 
osteoarthritis. We discovered 64 signals, 52 of them novel, more than doubling 
the number of established disease loci. Six signals fine-mapped to a single 
variant. We identified putative effector genes by integrating expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) colocalization, fine-mapping, and human 
rare-disease, animal-model, and osteoarthritis tissue expression data. We found 
enrichment for genes underlying monogenic forms of bone development diseases, 
and for the collagen formation and extracellular matrix organization biological 
pathways. Ten of the likely effector genes, including TGFB1 (transforming growth 
factor beta 1), FGF18 (fibroblast growth factor 18), CTSK (cathepsin K), and 
IL11 (interleukin 11), have therapeutics approved or in clinical trials, with 
mechanisms of action supportive of evaluation for efficacy in osteoarthritis.

Variance in IQ is associated with a wide range of health outcomes, and 1% of the 
population are affected by intellectual disability. Despite a century of 
research, the fundamental neural underpinnings of intelligence remain unclear. 
We integrate results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of intelligence 
with brain tissue and single cell gene expression data to identify tissues and 
cell types associated with intelligence. GWAS data for IQ (N = 78,308) were 
meta-analyzed with a study comparing 1247 individuals with mean IQ ~170 to 8185 
controls. Genes associated with intelligence implicate pyramidal neurons of the 
somatosensory cortex and CA1 region of the hippocampus, and midbrain embryonic 
GABAergic neurons. Tissue-specific analyses find the most significant enrichment 
for frontal cortex brain expressed genes. These results suggest specific 
neuronal cell types and genes may be involved in intelligence and provide new 
hypotheses for neuroscience experiments using model systems.

The Open Targets Platform integrates evidence from genetics, genomics, 
transcriptomics, drugs, animal models and scientific literature to score and 
rank target-disease associations for drug target identification. The 
associations are displayed in an intuitive user interface 
(https://www.targetvalidation.org), and are available through a REST-API 
(https://api.opentargets.io/v3/platform/docs/swagger-ui) and a bulk download 
(https://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data). In addition to target-disease 
associations, we also aggregate and display data at the target and disease 
levels to aid target prioritisation. Since our first publication two years ago, 
we have made eight releases, added new data sources for target-disease 
associations, started including causal genetic variants from non genome-wide 
targeted arrays, added new target and disease annotations, launched new 
visualisations and improved existing ones and released a new web tool for batch 
search of up to 200 targets. We have a new URL for the Open Targets Platform 
REST-API, new REST endpoints and also removed the need for authorisation for API 
fair use. Here, we present the latest developments of the Open Targets Platform, 
expanding the evidence and target-disease associations with new and improved 
data sources, refining data quality, enhancing website usability, and increasing 
our user base with our training workshops, user support, social media and 
bioinformatics forum engagement.

The GWAS Catalog delivers a high-quality curated collection of all published 
genome-wide association studies enabling investigations to identify causal 
variants, understand disease mechanisms, and establish targets for novel 
therapies. The scope of the Catalog has also expanded to targeted and exome 
arrays with 1000 new associations added for these technologies. As of September 
2018, the Catalog contains 5687 GWAS comprising 71673 variant-trait associations 
from 3567 publications. New content includes 284 full P-value summary statistics 
datasets for genome-wide and new targeted array studies, representing 6 × 109 
individual variant-trait statistics. In the last 12 months, the Catalog's user 
interface was accessed by ∼90000 unique users who viewed >1 million pages. We 
have improved data access with the release of a new RESTful API to support 
high-throughput programmatic access, an improved web interface and a new summary 
statistics database. Summary statistics provision is supported by a new format 
proposed as a community standard for summary statistics data representation. 
This format was derived from our experience in standardizing heterogeneous 
submissions, mapping formats and in harmonizing content. Availability:

The PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) 
is the world's largest data repository of mass spectrometry-based proteomics 
data, and is one of the founding members of the global ProteomeXchange (PX) 
consortium. In this manuscript, we summarize the developments in PRIDE resources 
and related tools since the previous update manuscript was published in Nucleic 
Acids Research in 2016. In the last 3 years, public data sharing through PRIDE 
(as part of PX) has definitely become the norm in the field. In parallel, data 
re-use of public proteomics data has increased enormously, with multiple 
applications. We first describe the new architecture of PRIDE Archive, the 
archival component of PRIDE. PRIDE Archive and the related data submission 
framework have been further developed to support the increase in submitted data 
volumes and additional data types. A new scalable and fault tolerant storage 
backend, Application Programming Interface and web interface have been 
implemented, as a part of an ongoing process. Additionally, we emphasize the 
improved support for quantitative proteomics data through the mzTab format. At 
last, we outline key statistics on the current data contents and volume of 
downloads, and how PRIDE data are starting to be disseminated to added-value 
resources including Ensembl, UniProt and Expression Atlas.

COSMIC, the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer 
(https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk) is the most detailed and comprehensive resource 
for exploring the effect of somatic mutations in human cancer. The latest 
release, COSMIC v86 (August 2018), includes almost 6 million coding mutations 
across 1.4 million tumour samples, curated from over 26 000 publications. In 
addition to coding mutations, COSMIC covers all the genetic mechanisms by which 
somatic mutations promote cancer, including non-coding mutations, gene fusions, 
copy-number variants and drug-resistance mutations. COSMIC is primarily 
hand-curated, ensuring quality, accuracy and descriptive data capture. Building 
on our manual curation processes, we are introducing new initiatives that allow 
us to prioritize key genes and diseases, and to react more quickly and 
comprehensively to new findings in the literature. Alongside improvements to the 
public website and data-download systems, new functionality in COSMIC-3D allows 
exploration of mutations within three-dimensional protein structures, their 
protein structural and functional impacts, and implications for druggability. In 
parallel with COSMIC's deep and broad variant coverage, the Cancer Gene Census 
(CGC) describes a curated catalogue of genes driving every form of human cancer. 
Currently describing 719 genes, the CGC has recently introduced functional 
descriptions of how each gene drives disease, summarized into the 10 cancer 
Hallmarks.

Since the migrations that led humans to colonize Earth, our species has faced 
frequent adaptive challenges that have left signatures in the landscape of 
genetic variation and that we can identify in our today's genomes. Here, we (i) 
perform an outlier approach on eight different population genetic statistics for 
22 non-admixed human populations of the Phase III of the 1000 Genomes Project to 
detect selective sweeps at different historical ages, as well as events of 
recurrent positive selection in the human lineage; and (ii) create PopHumanScan, 
an online catalog that compiles and annotates all candidate regions under 
selection to facilitate their validation and thoroughly analysis. Well-known 
examples of human genetic adaptation published elsewhere are included in the 
catalog, as well as hundreds of other attractive candidates that will require 
further investigation. Designed as a collaborative database, PopHumanScan aims 
to become a central repository to share information, guide future studies and 
help advance our understanding of how selection has modeled our genomes as a 
response to changes in the environment or lifestyle of human populations. 
PopHumanScan is open and freely available at https://pophumanscan.uab.cat.

In the last decade, genomics data have been largely adopted to sketch, study and 
better understand the complex mechanisms that underlie biological processes. The 
amount of publicly available data sources has grown accordingly, and several 
types of regulatory interactions have been collected and documented in 
literature. Unfortunately, often these efforts do not follow any data 
naming/interoperability/formatting standards, resulting in high-quality but 
often uninteroperable heterogeneous data repositories. To efficiently take 
advantage of the large amount of available data and integrate these 
heterogeneous sources of information, we built the RING (Regulatory Interaction 
Graph), an integrative standardized multilevel database of biological 
interactions able to provide a comprehensive and unmatched high-level 
perspective on several phenomena that take place in the regulatory cascade and 
that researchers can use to easily build regulatory networks around entities of 
interest.

Genomic data interpretation often requires analyses that move from a 
gene-by-gene focus to a focus on sets of genes that are associated with 
biological phenomena such as molecular processes, phenotypes, diseases, drug 
interactions or environmental conditions. Unique challenges exist in the 
curation of gene sets beyond the challenges in curation of individual genes. 
Here we highlight a literature curation workflow whereby gene sets are curated 
from peer-reviewed published data into GeneWeaver (GW), a data repository and 
analysis platform. We describe the system features that allow for a flexible yet 
precise curation procedure. We illustrate the value of curation by gene sets 
through analysis of independently curated sets that relate to the integrated 
stress response, showing that sets curated from independent sources all share 
significant Jaccard similarity. A suite of reproducible analysis tools is 
provided in GW as services to carry out interactive functional investigation of 
user-submitted gene sets within the context of over 150 000 gene sets 
constructed from publicly available resources and published gene lists. A 
curation interface supports the ability of users to design and maintain curation 
workflows of gene sets, including assigning, reviewing and releasing gene sets 
within a curation project context.

BACKGROUND: Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy with 
poor survival. With limited treatment options and high risk of relapse, 
identifying improved targets and therapies for adrenocortical carcinoma is 
important. We hypothesized that analysis of the database of The Cancer Genome 
Atlas could identify important novel biomarkers for improved therapeutic 
targeting of adrenocortical carcinoma.
METHODS: We utilized the University of Alabama interactive web resource to 
identify novel biomarkers observed in 79 adrenocortical carcinoma patients. 
Identified biomarkers were then examined for prognostic correlations using the 
cBioPortal and analyzed for statistical significance using STATA 13.0.
RESULTS: The Cancer Genome Atlas data mining in the University of Alabama 
interactive web resource for pathways associated with poor survival of patients 
with adrenocortical carcinoma revealed significant upregulation of genes 
involved in DNA damage and regulation of cell-cycle pathways, such as AURKA, 
AURKB, CDK1, CDK4, CDK6, PLK1, CHEK1, CHEK2, CDC7, BUB3, and MCM3 (P < 
.001-.05). On outcome correlation, greater expression levels of all the genes 
except CDK4 were associated with worse survival compared with medium or low 
levels of gene expression (P < .001 all) irrespective of age orsex. Consistent 
with our University of Alabama interactive web resource findings, data mining in 
the cBioPortal also revealed upregulation of genes regulating DNA-damage and 
cell cycle-related genes in 82% of patients (z score = 1.5).
CONCLUSION: Large data mining from the The Cancer Genome Atlas and cBioPortal 
databases identified overexpression of genes involved in DNA damage and those 
regulating pathways of the cell cycle, which correlated with poorer overall 
survival in adrenocortical carcinoma patients.

The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) Cancer Gene Census (CGC) 
is an expert-curated description of the genes driving human cancer that is used 
as a standard in cancer genetics across basic research, medical reporting and 
pharmaceutical development. After a major expansion and complete re-evaluation, 
the 2018 CGC describes in detail the effect of 719 cancer-driving genes. The 
recent expansion includes functional and mechanistic descriptions of how each 
gene contributes to disease generation in terms of the key cancer hallmarks and 
the impact of mutations on gene and protein function. These functional 
characteristics depict the extraordinary complexity of cancer biology and 
suggest multiple cancer-related functions for many genes, which are often highly 
tissue-dependent or tumour stage-dependent. The 2018 CGC encompasses a second 
tier, describing an expanding list of genes (currently 145) from more recent 
cancer studies that show supportive but less detailed indications of a role in 
cancer.

Recent network and system biology analyses suggest that most complex diseases 
are regulated by robust and highly interconnected pathways that could be better 
modulated by small molecules binding to multiple biological targets. These 
pieces of evidence recently led to devote efforts on identifying single chemical 
entities that bind to two different disease-relevant targets. Here, we first 
predicted in silico and later confirmed in vitro that UPF 1069, a known 
bioactive poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1/2 (PARP1/2) molecule, and 
hydroxyfasudil, a known bioactive Rho-associated protein kinase-1/2 (ROCK1/2) 
molecule, have low-micromolar cross-affinity for ROCK1/2 and PARP1/2, 
respectively. These molecules can now be regarded as chemical seeds from which 
pharmacological tools could be generated to study the impact of dual inhibition 
of PARPs and ROCKs in preclinical models of a variety of complex diseases where 
both targets are involved.

BACKGROUND: The Open Targets Platform integrates different data sources in order 
to facilitate identification of potential therapeutic drug targets to treat 
human diseases. It currently provides evidence for nearly 2.6 million potential 
target-disease pairs. G-protein coupled receptors are a drug target class of 
high interest because of the number of successful drugs being developed against 
them over many years. Here we describe a systematic approach utilizing the Open 
Targets Platform data to uncover and prioritize potential new disease 
indications for the G-protein coupled receptors and their ligands.
RESULTS: Utilizing the data available in the Open Targets platform, potential 
G-protein coupled receptor and endogenous ligand disease association pairs were 
systematically identified. Intriguing examples such as GPR35 for inflammatory 
bowel disease and CXCR4 for viral infection are used as illustrations of how a 
systematic approach can aid in the prioritization of interesting drug discovery 
hypotheses. Combining evidences for G-protein coupled receptors and their 
corresponding endogenous peptidergic ligands increases confidence and provides 
supportive evidence for potential new target-disease hypotheses. Comparing such 
hypotheses to the global pharma drug discovery pipeline to validate the approach 
showed that more than 93% of G-protein coupled receptor-disease pairs with a 
high overall Open Targets score involved receptors with an existing drug 
discovery program.
CONCLUSIONS: The Open Targets gene-disease score can be used to prioritize 
potential G-protein coupled receptors-indication hypotheses. In addition, 
availability of multiple different evidence types markedly increases confidence 
as does combining evidence from known receptor-ligand pairs. Comparing the 
top-ranked hypotheses to the current global pharma pipeline serves validation of 
our approach and identifies and prioritizes new therapeutic opportunities.

    Large-scale investigation of the reasons why potentially important genes are 
ignored.

Determining the functions of human genes is a key objective for understanding 
disease and enabling development of new therapeutic approaches. A number of 
recent studies have shown that the amount of attention the research community 
gives to each of the more than 20,000 human genes is dramatically skewed toward 
specific, well-known genes. In this issue, Stoeger and colleagues uncover the 
factors that explain this bias and offer a way ahead to move more genes into the 
research limelight.

Discovering disease-associated genes (DG) is strategic for understanding 
pathological mechanisms. DGs form modules in protein interaction networks and 
diseases with common phenotypes share more DGs or have more closely interacting 
DGs. This prompted the development of Specific Betweenness (S2B) to find genes 
associated with two related diseases. S2B prioritizes genes frequently and 
specifically present in shortest paths linking two disease modules. Top S2B 
scores identified genes in the overlap of artificial network modules more than 
80% of the times, even with incomplete or noisy knowledge. Applied to 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Spinal Muscular Atrophy, S2B candidates were 
enriched in biological processes previously associated with motor neuron 
degeneration. Some S2B candidates closely interacted in network cliques, 
suggesting common molecular mechanisms for the two diseases. S2B is a valuable 
tool for DG prediction, bringing new insights into pathological mechanisms. More 
generally, S2B can be applied to infer the overlap between other types of 
network modules, such as functional modules or context-specific subnetworks. An 
R package implementing S2B is publicly available at 
https://github.com/frpinto/S2B .

Coelomic fluid (CF) is the earliest dynamic and complex fluid of the gestational 
sac. CF contains maternal cells and proteins produced by embryonic cells, 
tissues and excretions. The biochemical composition of CF is modified throughout 
the first trimester of pregnancy and its protein profile reflects both 
physiological/pathological changes affecting the embryo and mother. 
Identification of variations in the balance of proteins might indicate 
particular types of pathologies, or ascertain specific genetic disorders. A 
platform utilizing protein enrichment procedures coupled with shotgun 
identification and iTRAQ differentiation provided the identification and 
quantitation of 88 unique embryonic proteins. It is relevant to note that 
chromosome X protein CXorf23 was found suggesting the embryo sex. Foetal sex was 
determined by Quantitative Fluorescent Polymerase Chain Reaction (QF-PCR) on 
coelomic cells, foetal tissues and maternal white blood cells, with a 100% 
concordance rate between iTRAQ-MS/MS and QF-PCR data. The functional 
associations among the identified proteins were investigated using STRING 
database. Open Targets Platform showed as significant the following therapeutic 
areas: nervous, respiratory, eye and head system disease.

Choosing the right biological target is the critical primary decision for the 
development of new drugs. Systematic genetic association testing of both human 
diseases and quantitative traits, along with resultant findings of coincident 
associations between them, is becoming a powerful approach to infer drug 
targetable candidates and generate in vitro tests to identify compounds that can 
modulate them therapeutically. Here, we discuss opportunities and challenges, 
and infer criteria for the optimal use of genetic findings in the drug discovery 
pipeline.

Efforts to maximize the indications potential and revenue from drugs that are 
already marketed are largely motivated by what Sir James Black, a Nobel 
Prize-winning pharmacologist advocated-"The most fruitful basis for the 
discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug". However, rational design 
of drug mixtures poses formidable challenges because of the lack of or limited 
information about in vivo cell regulation, mechanisms of genetic pathway 
activation, and in vivo pathway interactions. Hence, most of the successfully 
repositioned drugs are the result of "serendipity", discovered during late phase 
clinical studies of unexpected but beneficial findings. The connections between 
drug candidates and their potential adverse drug reactions or new applications 
are often difficult to foresee because the underlying mechanism associating them 
is largely unknown, complex, or dispersed and buried in silos of information. 
Discovery of such multi-domain pharmacomodules-pharmacologically relevant 
sub-networks of biomolecules and/or pathways-from collection of databases by 
independent/simultaneous mining of multiple datasets is an active area of 
research. Here, while presenting some of the promising bioinformatics approaches 
and pipelines, we summarize and discuss the current and evolving landscape of 
computational drug repositioning.

Developing new drugs continues to be a highly inefficient and costly business. 
By repurposing an existing compound for a different indication, drug 
repositioning offers an attractive alternative to traditional drug discovery. 
Most of these approaches work by matching transcriptional disease signatures to 
anti-correlated gene expression profiles of drug perturbations. Genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) are of great interest to researchers in the 
pharmaceutical industry because drug programmes with supporting genetic evidence 
are more likely to successfully progress through the drug discovery pipeline. 
Here, we present a systematic approach to generate drug repositioning hypothesis 
based on disease genetics by mining public repositories of GWAS data and drug 
transcriptomic profiles. We find that genes genetically associated with a 
certain disease are more likely to be differentially expressed in the same 
disease (p-value = 1.54e-17 and AUC = 0.75) and that, in existing drug - disease 
combinations, genes significantly up- or down-regulated after drug treatment are 
enriched for genes genetically associated with that disease (p-value = 1.1e-79 
and AUC = 0.64). Finally, we use this framework to generate and rank novel 
GWAS-driven drug repositioning predictions.

Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the 
characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in 
reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small 
repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or 
pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations 
on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the 
continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of 
new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability 
of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly 
exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach 
involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a 
later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the 
clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a 
robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among 
different cancer-related skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform 
combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers 
was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical 
robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer 
biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the 
identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were 
obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene 
expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in 
the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation 
to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in 
cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based 
classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained 
exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin 
states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration 
with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq.

Models for predicting phenotypic outcomes from genotypes have important 
applications to understanding genomic function and improving human health. Here, 
we develop a machine-learning system to predict cell-type-specific epigenetic 
and transcriptional profiles in large mammalian genomes from DNA sequence alone. 
By use of convolutional neural networks, this system identifies promoters and 
distal regulatory elements and synthesizes their content to make effective gene 
expression predictions. We show that model predictions for the influence of 
genomic variants on gene expression align well to causal variants underlying 
eQTLs in human populations and can be useful for generating mechanistic 
hypotheses to enable fine mapping of disease loci.

Objectives Angelica sinensis exerts various pharmacological effects, such as 
antioxidant and anti-apoptotic activity. This study aimed to investigate the 
active ingredients in A. sinensis with antioxidant properties and whether A. 
sinensis polysaccharide (ASP) protects H9c2 cells against oxidative and 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Methods The ingredients of A. sinensis and 
their targets and related pathways were determined using web-based databases. 
Markers of oxidative stress, cell viability, apoptosis, and ER stress-related 
signalling pathways were measured in H9c2 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2) and ASP. Results The ingredient-pathway-disease network showed that A. 
sinensis exerted protective effects against oxidative injury through its various 
active ingredients on regulation of multiple pathways. Subsequent experiments 
showed that ASP pretreatment significantly decreased H2O2-induced cytotoxicity 
and apoptosis in H9c2 cells. ASP pretreatment inhibited H2O2-induced reactive 
oxygen species generation, lactic dehydrogenase release, and malondialdehyde 
production. ASP exerted beneficial effects by inducing activating transcription 
factor 6 (ATF6) and increasing ATF6 target protein levels, which in turn 
attenuated ER stress and increased antioxidant activity. Conclusions Our 
findings indicate that ASP, a major water-soluble component of A. sinensis, 
exerts protective effects against H2O2-induced injury in H9c2 cells by 
activating the ATF6 pathway, thus ameliorating ER and oxidative stress.

A large proportion of biomedical research and the development of therapeutics is 
focused on a small fraction of the human genome. In a strategic effort to map 
the knowledge gaps around proteins encoded by the human genome and to promote 
the exploration of currently understudied, but potentially druggable, proteins, 
the US National Institutes of Health launched the Illuminating the Druggable 
Genome (IDG) initiative in 2014. In this article, we discuss how the systematic 
collection and processing of a wide array of genomic, proteomic, chemical and 
disease-related resource data by the IDG Knowledge Management Center have 
enabled the development of evidence-based criteria for tracking the target 
development level (TDL) of human proteins, which indicates a substantial 
knowledge deficit for approximately one out of three proteins in the human 
proteome. We then present spotlights on the TDL categories as well as key drug 
target classes, including G protein-coupled receptors, protein kinases and ion 
channels, which illustrate the nature of the unexplored opportunities for 
biomedical research and therapeutic development.

Neoplastic growth and cellular differentiation are critical hallmarks of tumor 
development. It is well established that cell-to-cell communication between 
tumor cells and "normal" surrounding cells regulates tumor differentiation and 
proliferation, aggressiveness, and resistance to treatment. Nevertheless, the 
mechanisms that result in tumor growth and spread as well as the adaptation of 
healthy surrounding cells to the tumor environment are poorly understood. A 
major component of these communication systems is composed of connexin 
(Cx)-containing channels including gap junctions (GJs), tunneling nanotubes 
(TNTs), and hemichannels (HCs). There are hundreds of reports about the role of 
Cx-containing channels in the pathogenesis of cancer, and most of them 
demonstrate a downregulation of these proteins. Nonetheless, new data 
demonstrate that a localized communication via Cx-containing GJs, HCs, and TNTs 
plays a key role in tumor growth, differentiation, and resistance to therapies. 
Moreover, the type and downstream effects of signals communicated between the 
different populations of tumor cells are still unknown. However, new approaches 
such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) could provide new 
insights into these signals communicated between connected cells. We propose 
that the identification and characterization of these new communication systems 
and their associated signaling could provide new targets to prevent or reduce 
the devastating consequences of cancer.

The assessment of the suitability of novel targets to intervention by different 
modalities, e.g. small molecules or antibodies, is increasingly seen as 
important in helping to select the most progressable targets at the outset of a 
drug discovery project. This perspective considers differing aspects of 
tractability and how it can be assessed using in silico and experimental 
approaches. We also share some of our experiences in using these approaches.

Realising the importance of assessing the quality of the biomolecular structures 
deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the Worldwide Protein Data Bank 
(wwPDB) partners established Validation Task Forces to obtain advice on the 
methods and standards to be used to validate structures determined by X-ray 
crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and three-dimensional 
electron cryo-microscopy. The resulting wwPDB validation pipeline is an integral 
part of the wwPDB OneDep deposition, biocuration and validation system. The 
wwPDB Validation Service webserver (https://validate.wwpdb.org) can be used to 
perform checks prior to deposition. Here, it is shown how validation metrics can 
be combined to produce an overall score that allows the ranking of 
macromolecular structures and domains in search results. The ValTrendsDB 
database provides users with a convenient way to access and analyse validation 
information and other properties of X-ray crystal structures in the PDB, 
including investigating trends in and correlations between different structure 
properties and validation metrics.

Natural genetic variation in the human genome is a cause of individual 
differences in responses to medications and is an underappreciated burden on 
public health. Although 108 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets 
of 475 (∼34%) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and account for 
a global sales volume of over 180 billion US dollars annually, the prevalence of 
genetic variation among GPCRs targeted by drugs is unknown. By analyzing data 
from 68,496 individuals, we find that GPCRs targeted by drugs show genetic 
variation within functional regions such as drug- and effector-binding sites in 
the human population. We experimentally show that certain variants of μ-opioid 
and Cholecystokinin-A receptors could lead to altered or adverse drug response. 
By analyzing UK National Health Service drug prescription and sales data, we 
suggest that characterizing GPCR variants could increase prescription precision, 
improving patients' quality of life, and relieve the economic and societal 
burden due to variable drug responsiveness. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

Expression Atlas (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) is an added value database that 
provides information about gene and protein expression in different species and 
contexts, such as tissue, developmental stage, disease or cell type. The 
available public and controlled access data sets from different sources are 
curated and re-analysed using standardized, open source pipelines and made 
available for queries, download and visualization. As of August 2017, Expression 
Atlas holds data from 3,126 studies across 33 different species, including 731 
from plants. Data from large-scale RNA sequencing studies including Blueprint, 
PCAWG, ENCODE, GTEx and HipSci can be visualized next to each other. In 
Expression Atlas, users can query genes or gene-sets of interest and explore 
their expression across or within species, tissues, developmental stages in a 
constitutive or differential context, representing the effects of diseases, 
conditions or experimental interventions. All processed data matrices are 
available for direct download in tab-delimited format or as R-data. In addition 
to the web interface, data sets can now be searched and downloaded through the 
Expression Atlas R package. Novel features and visualizations include the 
on-the-fly analysis of gene set overlaps and the option to view gene 
co-expression in experiments investigating constitutive gene expression across 
tissues or other conditions.

Since the human genome project in 2003, the view of personalized medicine to 
improve diagnosis and cure diseases at the molecular level became more real. 
Sequencing the human genome brought some benefits in medicine such as early 
detection of diseases with a genetic predisposition, treating patients with rare 
diseases, the design of gene therapy and the understanding of pharmacogenetics 
in the metabolism of drugs. This review explains the concepts of 
pharmacogenetics, polymorphisms, mutations, variations, and alleles, and how 
this information has helped us better understand the metabolism of drugs. 
Multiple resources are presented to promote reducing the gap between scientists, 
physicians, and patients in understanding the use and benefits of 
pharmacogenetics. Some of the most common clinical examples of genetic variants 
and how pharmacogenetics was used to determine treatment options for patients 
having these variants were discussed. Finally, we evaluated some of the 
challenges of implementing pharmacogenetics in a clinical setting and proposed 
actions to be taken to make pharmacogenetics a standard diagnostic tool in 
personalized medicine.

The development of new drugs has become challenging as the necessary investments 
in time and money have increased while drug approval rates have decreased. A 
potential solution to this problem is drug repositioning which aims to use 
existing drugs to treat conditions for which they were not originally intended. 
One approach that may enhance the likelihood of success is to reposition drugs 
against a target that has a genetic basis. The multitude of genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) conducted in recent years represents a large 
potential pool of novel targets for drug repositioning. Although 
trait-associated variants identified from GWAS still need to be causally linked 
to a target gene, recently developed functional genomic techniques, databases, 
and workflows are helping to remove this bottleneck. The pre-clinical validation 
of repositioning against these targets also needs to be carefully performed to 
ensure that findings are not confounded by off-target effects or limitations of 
the techniques used. Nevertheless, the approaches described in this review have 
the potential to provide a faster, cheaper and more certain route to clinical 
approval.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most intensively studied drug 
targets, mostly due to their substantial involvement in human pathophysiology 
and their pharmacological tractability. Here, we report an up-to-date analysis 
of all GPCR drugs and agents in clinical trials, which reveals current trends 
across molecule types, drug targets and therapeutic indications, including 
showing that 475 drugs (~34% of all drugs approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)) act at 108 unique GPCRs. Approximately 321 agents are 
currently in clinical trials, of which ~20% target 66 potentially novel GPCR 
targets without an approved drug, and the number of biological drugs, allosteric 
modulators and biased agonists has increased. The major disease indications for 
GPCR modulators show a shift towards diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer disease, 
although several central nervous system disorders are also highly represented. 
The 224 (56%) non-olfactory GPCRs that have not yet been explored in clinical 
trials have broad untapped therapeutic potential, particularly in genetic and 
immune system disorders. Finally, we provide an interactive online resource to 
analyse and infer trends in GPCR drug discovery.

A core tenet of precision oncology is the rational choice of drugs to interact 
with patient-specific biological targets of interest, but it is currently 
difficult for researchers to obtain consistent and well-supported target 
information for pharmaceutical drugs. We review current drug-target interaction 
resources and critically assess how supporting evidence is handled. We introduce 
the concept of a unified Cancer Targetome to aggregate drug-target interactions 
in an evidence-based framework. We discuss current unmet needs and the 
implications for evidence-based clinical omics. The focus of this review is 
precision oncology but the discussion is highly relevant to targeted therapies 
in any area.

BACKGROUND: One of the most successful approaches to develop new small molecule 
therapeutics has been to start from a validated druggable protein target. 
However, only a small subset of potentially druggable targets has attracted 
significant research and development resources. The Illuminating the Druggable 
Genome (IDG) project develops resources to catalyze the development of likely 
targetable, yet currently understudied prospective drug targets. A central 
component of the IDG program is a comprehensive knowledge resource of the 
druggable genome.
RESULTS: As part of that effort, we have developed a framework to integrate, 
navigate, and analyze drug discovery data based on formalized and standardized 
classifications and annotations of druggable protein targets, the Drug Target 
Ontology (DTO). DTO was constructed by extensive curation and consolidation of 
various resources. DTO classifies the four major drug target protein families, 
GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on phylogenecity, 
function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression, 
chemical ligand and substrate characteristics, and target-family specific 
characteristics. The formal ontology was built using a new software tool to 
auto-generate most axioms from a database while supporting manual knowledge 
acquisition. A modular, hierarchical implementation facilitate ontology 
development and maintenance and makes use of various external ontologies, thus 
integrating the DTO into the ecosystem of biomedical ontologies. As a formal 
OWL-DL ontology, DTO contains asserted and inferred axioms. Modeling data from 
the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program 
illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced 
definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in 
the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target 
disease relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for 
druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene, 
protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism 
of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other 
types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging 
integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models, 
drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and 
qualities that are at the core of drug discovery. The first version of DTO is 
publically available via the website http://drugtargetontology.org/ , Github ( 
http://github.com/DrugTargetOntology/DTO ), and the NCBO Bioportal ( 
http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DTO ). The long-term goal of DTO is 
to provide such an integrative framework and to populate the ontology with this 
information as a community resource.

The aim of this study was to show how computational models can be used to 
increase our understanding of the role of microRNAs in osteoarthritis (OA) using 
miR-140 as an example. Bioinformatics analysis and experimental results from the 
literature were used to create and calibrate models of gene regulatory networks 
in OA involving miR-140 along with key regulators such as NF-κB, SMAD3, and 
RUNX2. The individual models were created with the modelling standard, Systems 
Biology Markup Language, and integrated to examine the overall effect of miR-140 
on cartilage homeostasis. Down-regulation of miR-140 may have either detrimental 
or protective effects for cartilage, indicating that the role of miR-140 is 
complex. Studies of individual networks in isolation may therefore lead to 
different conclusions. This indicated the need to combine the five chosen 
individual networks involving miR-140 into an integrated model. This model 
suggests that the overall effect of miR-140 is to change the response to an IL-1 
stimulus from a prolonged increase in matrix degrading enzymes to a pulse-like 
response so that cartilage degradation is temporary. Our current model can 
easily be modified and extended as more experimental data become available about 
the role of miR-140 in OA. In addition, networks of other microRNAs that are 
important in OA could be incorporated. A fully integrated model could not only 
aid our understanding of the mechanisms of microRNAs in ageing cartilage but 
could also provide a useful tool to investigate the effect of potential 
interventions to prevent cartilage loss.

Using successful genome-wide association results in psychiatry for drug 
repurposing is an ongoing challenge. Databases collecting drug targets and gene 
annotations are growing and can be harnessed to shed a new light on psychiatric 
disorders. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from 
the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) Schizophrenia working group to build a 
drug repositioning model for schizophrenia. As sample size increases, 
schizophrenia GWAS results show increasing enrichment for known antipsychotic 
drugs, selective calcium channel blockers, and antiepileptics. Each of these 
therapeutical classes targets different gene subnetworks. We identify 123 
Bonferroni-significant druggable genes outside the MHC, and 128 FDR-significant 
biological pathways related to neurons, synapses, genic intolerance, membrane 
transport, epilepsy, and mental disorders. These results suggest that, in 
schizophrenia, current well-powered GWAS results can reliably detect known 
schizophrenia drugs and thus may hold considerable potential for the 
identification of new therapeutic leads. Moreover, antiepileptics and calcium 
channel blockers may provide repurposing opportunities. This study also reveals 
significant pathways in schizophrenia that were not identified previously, and 
provides a workflow for pathway analysis and drug repurposing using GWAS 
results.

BACKGROUND: Target identification and validation is a pressing challenge in the 
pharmaceutical industry, with many of the programmes that fail for efficacy 
reasons showing poor association between the drug target and the disease. 
Computational prediction of successful targets could have a considerable impact 
on attrition rates in the drug discovery pipeline by significantly reducing the 
initial search space. Here, we explore whether gene-disease association data 
from the Open Targets platform is sufficient to predict therapeutic targets that 
are actively being pursued by pharmaceutical companies or are already on the 
market.
METHODS: To test our hypothesis, we train four different classifiers (a random 
forest, a support vector machine, a neural network and a gradient boosting 
machine) on partially labelled data and evaluate their performance using nested 
cross-validation and testing on an independent set. We then select the best 
performing model and use it to make predictions on more than 15,000 genes. 
Finally, we validate our predictions by mining the scientific literature for 
proposed therapeutic targets.
RESULTS: We observe that the data types with the best predictive power are 
animal models showing a disease-relevant phenotype, differential expression in 
diseased tissue and genetic association with the disease under investigation. On 
a test set, the neural network classifier achieves over 71% accuracy with an AUC 
of 0.76 when predicting therapeutic targets in a semi-supervised learning 
setting. We use this model to gain insights into current and failed programmes 
and to predict 1431 novel targets, of which a highly significant proportion has 
been independently proposed in the literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Our in silico approach shows that data linking genes and diseases 
is sufficient to predict novel therapeutic targets effectively and confirms that 
this type of evidence is essential for formulating or strengthening hypotheses 
in the target discovery process. Ultimately, more rapid and automated target 
prioritisation holds the potential to reduce both the costs and the development 
times associated with bringing new medicines to patients.

A Review of Recent Advances in Translational Bioinformatics: Bridges from 
Biology to Medicine.

Vamathevan J, Birney E.

Objectives: To highlight and provide insights into key developments in 
translational bioinformatics between 2014 and 2016. Methods: This review 
describes some of the most influential bioinformatics papers and resources that 
have been published between 2014 and 2016 as well as the national genome 
sequencing initiatives that utilize these resources to routinely embed genomic 
medicine into healthcare. Also discussed are some applications of the secondary 
use of patient data followed by a comprehensive view of the open challenges and 
emergent technologies. Results: Although data generation can be performed 
routinely, analyses and data integration methods still require active research 
and standardization to improve streamlining of clinical interpretation. The 
secondary use of patient data has resulted in the development of novel 
algorithms and has enabled a refined understanding of cellular and phenotypic 
mechanisms. New data storage and data sharing approaches are required to enable 
diverse biomedical communities to contribute to genomic discovery. Conclusion: 
The translation of genomics data into actionable knowledge for use in healthcare 
is transforming the clinical landscape in an unprecedented way. Exciting and 
innovative models that bridge the gap between clinical and academic research are 
set to open up the field of translational bioinformatics for rapid growth in a 
digital era.

ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactivity data on small drug-like 
molecules, used by drug discovery scientists. Among many access methods, a REST 
API provides programmatic access, allowing the remote retrieval of ChEMBL data 
and its integration into other applications. This approach allows scientists to 
move from a world where they go to the ChEMBL web site to search for relevant 
data, to one where ChEMBL data can be simply integrated into their everyday 
tools and work environment. Areas covered: This review highlights some of the 
audiences who may benefit from using the ChEMBL API, and the goals they can 
address, through the description of several use cases. The examples cover a team 
communication tool (Slack), a data analytics platform (KNIME), batch job 
management software (Luigi) and Rich Internet Applications. Expert opinion: The 
advent of web technologies, cloud computing and micro services oriented 
architectures have made REST APIs an essential ingredient of modern software 
development models. The widespread availability of tools consuming RESTful 
resources have made them useful for many groups of users. The ChEMBL API is a 
valuable resource of drug discovery bioactivity data for professional chemists, 
chemistry students, data scientists, scientific and web developers.

The tremendous growth in biological data has resulted in an increase in the 
number of research papers being published. This presents a great challenge for 
scientists in searching and assimilating facts described in those papers. 
Particularly, biological databases depend on curators to add highly precise and 
useful information that are usually extracted by reading research articles. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need to find ways to improve linking literature to 
the underlying data, thereby minimising the effort in browsing content and 
identifying key biological concepts.   As part of the development of Europe PMC, 
we have developed a new platform, SciLite, which integrates text-mined 
annotations from different sources and overlays those outputs on research 
articles. The aim is to aid researchers and curators using Europe PMC in finding 
key concepts more easily and provide links to related resources or tools, 
bridging the gap between literature and biological data.

BACKGROUND: We present the Europe PMC literature component of Open Targets - a 
target validation platform that integrates various evidence to aid drug target 
identification and validation. The component identifies target-disease 
associations in documents and ranks the documents based on their confidence from 
the Europe PMC literature database, by using rules utilising expert-provided 
heuristic information. The confidence score of a given document represents how 
valuable the document is in the scope of target validation for a given 
target-disease association by taking into account the credibility of the 
association based on the properties of the text. The component serves the 
platform regularly with the up-to-date data since December, 2015.
RESULTS: Currently, there are a total number of 1168365 distinct target-disease 
associations text mined from >26 million PubMed abstracts and >1.2 million Open 
Access full text articles. Our comparative analyses on the current available 
evidence data in the platform revealed that 850179 of these associations are 
exclusively identified by literature mining.
CONCLUSIONS: This component helps the platform's users by providing the most 
relevant literature hits for a given target and disease. The text mining 
evidence along with the other types of evidence can be explored visually through 
https://www.targetvalidation.org and all the evidence data is available for 
download in json format from https://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data .

This year's Database Issue of Nucleic Acids Research contains 152 papers that 
include descriptions of 54 new databases and update papers on 98 databases, of 
which 16 have not been previously featured in NAR As always, these databases 
cover a broad range of molecular biology subjects, including genome structure, 
gene expression and its regulation, proteins, protein domains, and 
protein-protein interactions. Following the recent trend, an increasing number 
of new and established databases deal with the issues of human health, from 
cancer-causing mutations to drugs and drug targets. In accordance with this 
trend, three recently compiled databases that have been selected by NAR 
reviewers and editors as 'breakthrough' contributions, denovo-db, the Monarch 
Initiative, and Open Targets, cover human de novo gene variants, disease-related 
phenotypes in model organisms, and a bioinformatics platform for therapeutic 
target identification and validation, respectively. We expect these databases to 
attract the attention of numerous researchers working in various areas of 
genetics and genomics. Looking back at the past 12 years, we present here the 
'golden set' of databases that have consistently served as authoritative, 
comprehensive, and convenient data resources widely used by the entire community 
and offer some lessons on what makes a successful database. The Database Issue 
is freely available online at the https://academic.oup.com/nar web site. An 
updated version of the NAR Molecular Biology Database Collection is available at 
http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/a/.

We have designed and developed a data integration and visualization platform 
that provides evidence about the association of known and potential drug targets 
with diseases. The platform is designed to support identification and 
prioritization of biological targets for follow-up. Each drug target is linked 
to a disease using integrated genome-wide data from a broad range of data 
sources. The platform provides either a target-centric workflow to identify 
diseases that may be associated with a specific target, or a disease-centric 
workflow to identify targets that may be associated with a specific disease. 
Users can easily transition between these target- and disease-centric workflows. 
The Open Targets Validation Platform is accessible at

ChEMBL is an open large-scale bioactivity database 
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl), previously described in the 2012 and 2014 
Nucleic Acids Research Database Issues. Since then, alongside the continued 
extraction of data from the medicinal chemistry literature, new sources of 
bioactivity data have also been added to the database. These include: deposited 
data sets from neglected disease screening; crop protection data; drug 
metabolism and disposition data and bioactivity data from patents. A number of 
improvements and new features have also been incorporated. These include the 
annotation of assays and targets using ontologies, the inclusion of targets and 
indications for clinical candidates, addition of metabolic pathways for drugs 
and calculation of structural alerts. The ChEMBL data can be accessed via a 
web-interface, RDF distribution, data downloads and RESTful web-services.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the main causes of infertility and 
affects 5-20% women of reproductive age. Despite the increased prevalence of 
PCOS, the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis and pathophysiology remains 
unclear. The expansion of omics on studying the mechanisms of PCOS has lead into 
vast amounts of proteins related to PCOS resulting to a challenge in collating 
and depositing this deluge of data into one place. A knowledge-based repository 
named as PCOSBase was developed to systematically store all proteins related to 
PCOS. These proteins were compiled from various online databases and published 
expression studies. Rigorous criteria were developed to identify those that were 
highly related to PCOS. They were manually curated and analysed to provide 
additional information on gene ontologies, pathways, domains, tissue 
localizations and diseases that associate with PCOS. Other proteins that might 
interact with PCOS-related proteins identified from this study were also 
included. Currently, 8185 PCOS-related proteins were identified and assigned to 
13 237 gene ontology vocabulary, 1004 pathways, 7936 domains, 29 disease 
classes, 1928 diseases, 91 tissues and 320 472 interactions. All publications 
related to PCOS are also indexed in PCOSBase. Data entries are searchable in the 
main page, search, browse and datasets tabs. Protein advanced search is provided 
to search for specific proteins. To date, PCOSBase has the largest collection of 
PCOS-related proteins. PCOSBase aims to become a self-contained database that 
can be used to further understand the PCOS pathogenesis and towards the 
identification of potential PCOS biomarkers. Database URL: http://pcosbase.org.
